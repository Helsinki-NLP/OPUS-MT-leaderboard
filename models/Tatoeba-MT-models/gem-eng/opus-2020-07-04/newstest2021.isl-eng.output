Crying for the World
The market campaign Look Like You Need Iceland has gone well and shouts and calls in the wild are starting to pull people across the world.
"You own the coal mine, I need Iceland," says one woman in the big world in comments on advertising from the market campaign Look Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another viewer will say goodbye to Iceland in her heart forever and a young woman says she must come to Iceland as her fiancé is residing there.
Sadly, however, it is in the United States and expects to wait another month.
Another observer asks if the passage to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if it comes from a different time zone.
The Eill Thordarson of Peel, the advertising company, together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that receptions have been more hopeful.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already begun.
In the beginning this is about creating PR values, it is getting the foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been interviewed in some seven hundred media outlets around the world, which total more than two billion people.
The value of this discussion is estimated at $8 billion.
It's not bad."
The primary market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, although the Americans are not on their way to the country in an emergency.
According to Egil, a well - known market area such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany has also been pleased, one of Russia’s most pleasant surprises.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically recommended.
“ These commercials have traveled far beyond what we expected, ” says Egill, who may have watched the material on YouTube for over four million people.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The pictures on the opening took the Year of Saeberg, a photographer of the morning magazine, on a recording of advertisements bearing the title “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The roofs went wide and wide, as in the gate of the guard of Reykjavík, in the spring of Reykjavík, at Skogarfoss, on the lake of Solheim, and in the cave at Hjorlifshelvah.
The playmasters were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson at Skotti productions and the filmman of the son of God.
The Icelandics Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary, were in play.
Thousands of Icelanders came to the commercials, but at the same time as recorded in South Africa, there was another group in Western and Western lands.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this work for the Iceland office," says Egill, adding that the cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such tasks it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the boundaries we are talking to."
Explosive spirit: Talk about the situation in the workplace, life sciences, and much more
Mr. Einar Dadason, Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Child Affairs, will meet in Sprengisand, which will begin today at 10:00 a.m. on the Wave.
He is also a Labour Market Minister and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also talks about rural areas and transports to a country that has been badly affected and controversial over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of VR, will also be involved, who will discuss his criticism of investment in bioeconomy funds and will suggest ideas that labor movements and employment figures will withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Then shall Ivar, the son of Ingimar, a traveler in the east, and the daughter of John, the governor of the market office of the north, be consulted concerning the journeys in the country.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if summer’s success is a misleading precept of what will come.
You can listen to the part below, starting at 10:00.
That's what it looks like today 25 years later
Elisa Donovan, a teenager, had a successful career in any form of youth.
World fame, however, was played by Amber in Clueless’s 25 - year - old film.
Then she also played in the parts of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has been treated recently, but she was able to look over the road and express herself about Clueless on a passionate television on the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I have to admit that I built the person mostly on girls I met at a school that wasn’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script I knew who that person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after breakfast.
About fifty cases occurred today at the headquarters table, and in the police journal, they said that things had changed.
The day at the Los Angeles Police Station began by the need for police to interfere with a man who had recently been released from prison after staying there because of drunk driving.
If the man did not want to leave after he was released, he would not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
Because of his progress, the man continued to stay at the police station.
Then, this morning, a man was arrested suspected of breaking into a company in Kopavogi.
Police also had to deal with two Breidholtian men for reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman sitting at a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the bill after a meal, so she was called to the police.
This morning, too, a car was reported stolen.
A white Renault van driver looked off her for a while, and she was then taken by the hands of an unbridled man.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Joyful Society — The Terrible Destiny of the Glaciers
The theory of the Internet has reached a curse on the stage of the Warrior, while Naya Rivera’s actress drowned in California on the days and thus became the third major factor in his life long before his death.
Glee is a popular feature of singing, dancing, and joy.
Youths in high school, their love, and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the pleasure of being in the cheering company, but through singing and dancing, the individuals of the parts seemed to be able to overcome any circumstances in their lives.
But outside the venues, there have been great tragedies over the players and the employees of the programs, so much so that theories have come to light that the episodes are cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santäna Lopez in the playoffs, cheerleader, who did not call all his grandmother.
After the stage series had run its course, Rivera began to own Ryan Dorsey, his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last, Rivera was announced to be missing after her four - year - old son found himself drifting in a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and could have reported to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed themselves to a swim and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to it.
An extensive search for Rivera took place.
The day after the search began, the police chief of the area reported that our search had been based on Rivera drowning.
Five days later Rivera was found and officially declared dead.
It is thought that she had suffered a great deal of current in the water and her new last demands to save her son.
Cause of death was reported drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the playoffs, the American footballer with the angel's voice, which played a key role in bringing the Joyful Society to the fore and respect.
Outside the scenes, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
Since 13 years of age, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt that they had come in, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look better.
Only two months after he finished the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having had a good time with friends.
Banamein was found to be a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a will act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability to drugs had been reduced so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death laid heavy on his fellow workers, but his opponent, Leah Michele, was determined to continue taking part and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and Finn’s character.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the play, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his colleagues in the Joyful Team, or until he got the balls to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles, where he was suspected of child pornography.
In his home search, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and the matter soon came out public.
Clearly, Salling was dead.
He was then accused and convicted of his transgressions.
He had four to seven years in prison, as well as what he would have to write down on the list of sexually transmitted offenders and seek treatment for infantile greed.
Before the judge had determined the penalty, Salling, who was then released from insurance, found himself close to his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from a long way before.
Jim Fuller was the manager of the show.
In 2013, he was quickly moved to sleep, only 41 years of age.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked in the show.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of much government and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014 and suffered from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, calling on her mother and sister, among other things, to be responsible for her situation.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow performers in an overcrowded studio and of having an elaborate star nebula.
Jesse Lukeen played a guest role in the 2012 season.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a real scandal.
The playmate Heather Morris played a major role in the play.
In 2010, she saw that unspoiled computer hackers found her in naked pictures and published on the Internet.
The playwrights Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the play and had a romantic relationship outside of them.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was violent in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases the growth of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the garden is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the aroma, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's playgrounds," says Axel Örn Gudmundsson, who spends his summers fishing on a beach but studies psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter season."
Beach hunting is a very comfortable summer work when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can have a good income, and I think it’s great to be able to skip a study loan.
The revenues also do me well in the winter," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who spent the summer fishing on the beach.
Axel was the youngest to dock at Tölknaverfirde when a journalist got a speech from him late at the beginning of the week."
“ I took the tenth grade shipmaster’s license for boats under 12 meters long, and I bought my boat in the summer after finishing my elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat, which was used by my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon; and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being on the sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had already fished.
So I had the boat in debt at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have a million and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“ I had been spending and collecting money, I had been working with my dad for the sea when I was a boy, I was fishing with him all summer and got my share.
I also put my money in my boat ticket."
Axel is born in Isaphard, from where all his mothers are; but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can fish here in the west because I have a legal home with my grandmother in Isaphard.
I learned in this area here, west of the reds with my dad.
I'm going between ways, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all the West Banks.
Although I feel best to be in the west, I have also served around Snowflakes and beyond.
I've also given for the south, but preferably a gray-faced walk," says Axel, who always roams one commemorative moment in the morning and says he sometimes talks to the gulls and sings to the sky, in the solitary hours out at the ballroom.
“ The Internet is good in the ocean, so I can call, listen to TV shows, and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into a hare; but certainly has been some weather, but never much danger," said Axel, who is lucky with that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the workday depends on how the fishing takes place each time.
“I’ve never been fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the holiday home, but then I’ve been constantly fishing for one and a half days out on the sea. ”
He says that the beach hunting arrangement is such that he can fish for 770 pounds a day, which he finds to be an obstacle.
“ Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only fish for twelve days a month, these four months of fishing for shoreliners, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days after the weather and nothing else.
Rather than having 48 days throughout the summer, this unnecessary pressure is to be calm and able to choose according to one’s head.
So could the regional exchange go for me too, and the sea-lock that is well located at the fishing grounds should get to enjoy it," says Axel, who mostly drags cod out of the salty sea on his shores, but also only ufsa and some other species float along.
Axel is working over the winter with his university degree at Nupi School in Kopavogi.
“ I don’t think we’re many sailors working in the country’s playgrounds, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only going to work temporarily at the academy.
“ I got stuck there because I think this is a wonderful job.
I hope the psychology course will be used to me at the school in the future," says Axel, who also has a long history of business science.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
An error in a registration page that people fill out when they arrive in the country caused an individual, who lives here on land, to be called back to the screen.
A registration number is not required if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is made in Icelandic.
“ This will be examined this week, ” says a specialist in the field of psychiatric disorders at the surgeon’s department.
Three domestic infections were detected in the National Hospital’s virologic division yesterday.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the land on July 15, two days after the implementation of so - called home - security regulations.
Those living in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and again announced in a sample four to five days later.
However, it was reported in the Saturday news of RUV that the person had followed the old system.
The display on the border was negative and was not returned to the virus scan.
Camilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the medical field of the surgeon’s district, says in a conversation with a news office that this can be caused by an error in the electronic record sheet.
Filling out the English registration sheet is not a requirement to insert numeric characters as shown in the Icelandic version.
This has been thought primarily of by foreign travelers.
Therefore, the person was not given an automatic invitation to show up.
Camilla, however, says many have followed the rules on homecoming although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to send people back into the show after they arrived in the country.
"This will be considered in the week how it is possible to make it easier for people to draw their attention to the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been implanted in a pyrexia.
They all go to the sample, but two were beginning to show signs.
The three infections detected yesterday are now being infected, largely completed due to two diseases reported on Friday.
In both cases, sequencing of Icelandic genetic analyses has shown that there are non-refined variants of the corone virus.
In the second case, the gangs have pointed to Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be up to you tomorrow where the other virus is coming from.
A total of 15 are now isolated according to the COVID.is web.
135's in a pyrexia.
Four of the five infections unrelated
Five domestic offences have been detected in this country in the last few days.
Of these, four are not connected and there is no evidence of the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports event yesterday.
Infection is still ongoing.
Originally, a third drug was sent to a pyrexia, which was reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are pyrexia due to these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is the second short period of time that affects sports events and has raised questions about whether such events should take place.
John K. Johansson, a communications manager at the National Police Department, says it well, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
“ We are constantly pressing for all those who live here to maintain individual infectious agents.
We also need to be critical of people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be followed.
Then events can be held," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by airborne protection.
In addition, rules and standards are in constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly being done by the National Police Department and the National Medical Office, is considering these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and at the same time with service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says John.
“ We need to push people forward on the good road we were on in order to keep up with the results we have so far. ”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to catch the breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronary virus infection.
Diabetes mellitus was reported on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, also with diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen.
The Reuters reporter says fear of Brumfield is not without reason.
The figures of a new study conducted by the U.S. authorities show that almost 40% of those who have been treated with diabetes 2 were the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases to half.
A study by the U.S. Bureau of Disease Control (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the crown virus during the February and May season.
Jonathan Wordham, a CDC specialist, says that the results are striking, especially for those who have a diagnosis of diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Hidden in slow growth was Reuters surveyed, pointing out the answers from the 12 countries that responded to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported the underlying diseases.
“ There was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now COVID—19 has broken through as a powerful age," Reuters, the director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University, said.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among black people and people of South American origin, who have also been more severe from the Korean virus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes 2 is to control the disease with physical activity, good diet, and help health care professionals.
The Korean virus epidemic, however, has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
Some have been forced to continue to work and have thereby stopped being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities have been able to be aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 might be caused by the virus.
When the SARS crowned the virus in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in 2009, this group was three times more likely to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were enrolled in intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COWID-19 virus may have increased, the epidemic has removed the cover of many previously unknown complications.
“ I’m afraid we’ll see the floods of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Association of Diabetes.
Physicians have warned that the coronary virus epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
As a direct new study, the crowning virus may lead to an increase in diabetes.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the crown virus and diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, an organ that is already weak in many people with diabetes.
A high percentage of glucose and lipids in diabetics can then produce a truly “cystous storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged epithelial cells may also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle game," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all related to the burden."
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they went out of the room."
The wife of Asrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual request of artist Ragnari Kjartan son to engage in sex in front of a camera for the artist’s work in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget this when he first met his wife and grandmother, Assrúna Magnusdaughter.
“ I was very impressed by her.
It was just the radiation, of course, but then I also thought it was really cute.
And you still think," he says.
Assrún also remembers this end, the husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
"Last weekend," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at first sight.
“ I felt and felt so much excitement around Atla, which I liked.
There's a lot going on and a lot to do, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that her wife and her husband have emphasized the need to take their own lead.
“ We don’t tie our backs to the same knots as our companions.
We're avoiding the bus we're separating around us."
This may be the reason why they took the matter from Ragnar Kjartan’s son, an artist, even though it would be rather unusual.
“Christina Anna, our common friend, contacted us and asked if we could come to dinner with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s wife’s Ingibjör, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio of Snaps, and received desert wine, and then both desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art show that he thought he would set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall.
“ He had multiple works of art called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Asrún says, he described the work as a banal and decadent second from the everyday lives of the Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was about to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating."
The senan whom Ragnar asked the couple to join in was to show young middle - class couples to love in a minimalist room.
"It's the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar very much, although they knew of him and he did, “but they knew us and felt that we fit in.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
Perhaps they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who were sexually exploited to perform for others."
They said good - bye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just there? ’
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Ásrún and Atli taking over.
"It's about love and closeness"
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the Mt.
There was a very rare movie theater; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician, and a couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We haven’t decided anything about what we should be like.
We received some brief counsel, but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom we were doing.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
“ Yes, it was a bit romantic, ” says Atli and Ásrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation at a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommi saw this, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ It’s about love as much as it’s about sex itself, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son at the Reykjavik Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts thinking about it, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone like this, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," reminds Ásrún.
And would the involvement in the work have deepened the relationship between Asrus and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with the related family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Asrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else, ” she says, turning to the husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it’s just one second in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other things, it’s really cool.
I was able to get a little out of it and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the second child of the couple when the tendon was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrúna and Atla in Love Stories on Rás 1.

Mr. Free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of the press after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to have an armed bodyguard where he was afraid of his life.
However, it has not been easy for the presidents of the United States to command ambassadors in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst’s resignation at the end of April 2009, the U.S. ambassador’s office on the land has been completely without ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Worst left office in a peculiar situation, but Kastlös reported in 2009 that she should have received the Fálka word.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the president’s office, stating that she would not be honored.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor arrived, September 2010.
In some respects, Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but that was not the case.
At the end of the work, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
In the fall of 2013, he resigned from the office of an ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassadorless period took place.
Robert Barber was given the approval of the United States Congress in January 2015 and arrived shortly thereafter, but then no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama’s election campaign.
As soon as Donald Trump accepted the office of president, January 20, 2017, he took up his duties with a political ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington administration.
So two years passed until the U.S. Congress, Jeffrey Ross announced Gunter at his meeting to ask him the questions and then confirm him as an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to the council he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter, formerly a physician in California, has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition group of Jews in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson formed an organization, but Adelson is an avid supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s rule was to appoint people to a key office, and in recent years the United States Congress has been working very long, including confirming ambassadors in office.
So since 2009, it has been an unspoiled ambassador in Iceland for over five years.
This, however, has not prevented operations by the embassy that opened up a new headquarters at Envyateig.
The results are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, while thick safety walls envelop the building and bulletproof glass is available in all windows.
Yet, it does not seem enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
Former player IBV suffered racism in Iceland-- "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player IBV, claims to have experienced racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is shown in the interview with Tonny, who appeared on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who plays in Uganda's top league.
During the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including time here, but he played with IBV, Val, and Development in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but in addition, he also had the loyalty number that I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, playing on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things Tony talks about is racism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players experience when playing in Europe.
“ It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was all about.
He told me then that my opponent had given me a racial speech after I let him down."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he made the most of his mistakes.
Tonny had not reached Haugesund’s initial team, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but then he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland.
I think if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the opportunity that I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has been based on his dreams of becoming a big European player.
Finding snakes in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 small, long, black snake in a woman's neck looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull out the worm with a key.
A study revealed that there were parasites.
CNN's reporting this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days earlier, which are thin cuts of meat.
Soon after the worm was removed, the woman recovered, but parasites like these are often found in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi moved to bed in the West, cases of parasites have increased.
Fear the launch of another wave in Europe
Spain is now on the verge of worrying about another wave of the Korean virus in Europe, where governments have taken steps to re-enact the proliferation of the Korean virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infections abound.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in Britain all have to travel to Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of travel to Spain.
In France and Germany, there is a further increase in the number of cases, where governments are trying to balance the spread of the virus and bring economic life back on.
Europe's position is, however, good for other parts of the world, but the global incidence of infection is approaching 300 000 a day, with the highest rates of infection in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, confirmed infection has reached 16 million worldwide, with deaths confirmed to be related to the virus at 644 thousand.
The Mosaic Works of God will finally enjoy themselves to the fullest extent
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík, there's a big deep hole.
In it, men have orange helmets.
There's also a big grave.
And other smaller work machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the sidewalk is capable, and many now stop and respect the works of millions of mussels — just as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not respect it.
The work has been hidden so far, right in front of it was a parking lot that was always under siege.
People lay there, locked the car in a rush, and then started to take care of their business in the city center.
"Living and diverse public spaces" and "adult urban areas" are a guide to the remodeling of the current Cryggava River.
The goal is to make the territory a better place for the family to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work will be a square and where the area is well equipped with the sun, it is thought to be suitable as a sleeping area for the passersby.
The work of art will be illustrated and will now make the material field enjoy better than before on this 142 - square - mile [142 sq m] surface.
In the area, there will also be small “drum sprayers, ” some water shells, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, the Reykjavík city of Reykjavík, together with the Veitum, is described as being being replaced.
The layers of water supply, heat supply and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to years, but since 1925, the school records and cold water records have served residents and businesses in the city center for nearly a century.
Once the road is reopened, cars can drive it back.
However, it becomes a monopolistic street, creating a calmer and accessible space for walking.
In 1971, an architect named Gisli Halldorson, noted that the house was being used on the Customs Manager’s website.
Because of the damage to the seashore through the house, 250 square feet [250 sq m] of windowless walls formed into the street.
The Building Committee and Architect agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall street picture if no special arrangements were made to adorn the house’s appearance.
So people agreed to calculate by having them put on a permanent work of art.
During that time, a large number of words were spoken by Gerda Helgadaughter, an artist, in the summary.
She had worked hard at musical works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before deciding whether the work would be competitive.
The work had often been discussed as having to reflect life at the port, but since it was made, the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavik.
When discussed with the artist, she had to trax the mind of such a work.
Had to agree that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She was given the time she needed to do so herself, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for a discussion.
She was immediately accepted to ask her to do the job.
At the same time, Oidtmann, the brothers in Germany, who had been working for a long time with Gerður on the construction of famous works of art in all parts of Europe, was asked to negotiate an overall contract with her and the famous art company.
A contract was made and a work of art was commissioned by the brothers, who then took care of the construction of the Tollhaus.
All the work was very well done, both by the daughters of Helga, and by the brothers of Oidt, says in the synopsis.
Over and over again, it has resisted unblemished Icelandic weather.
It took some two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tullhaus work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to transport more strains to land
Minister of Social Affairs, Einar Dadason, announces that more public institutions will be relocated to land in the near future.
This was said by a minister in the episode Explosives on the Wave at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the FMD would be moved north to Söðárkrok in the fall.
Six experts in the field of fires work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the Agency to the north, and the National Association of Fire and Disease Carriers has criticised the transport of cattle.
“ I think we should take further steps in this world.
I'm preparing for further steps in this creature.
More transportation," said Ásmundur.
He says that he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public employment to a country, as I was doing with the National Institute of Economics and Employment," said Assmundur, but he also took an example of other institutions that have been transferred to land and played a significant role in rural communities, such as the transportation of Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland's Landspoke to Akranness and unemployment insurance in the Skagastroden.
All the best from the second day of Mestaramot
94th Iceland’s free sports championship ended today at Thorsfield in Akureyri.
Some of the tournaments were held on the second day of the race.
An exciting contest was scheduled for women in Thorsvellli, but Vigdis Jónsdóttir from FH put Iceland'smet into a 2014 battle that lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from IR improved his assessment in May of last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandic valuation back earlier this summer and has been in fan form lately, but she has tripled Iceland's valuation of what is still summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has not recovered today.
She had only one valid cast of five, threw 20.69 feet [25.69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 feet [60.08 m] in her final experiment, and immediately set a testimonial.
Her Icelandic record was set earlier in July at 62.69 feet [69.69 m] and was therefore quite a bit away from it.
Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir from IR had the second best cast of the day, which improved her best performance with a cast of 50.18 metres.
In a group of men, the FH-linger Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland's metafi, won a secure victory, but he threw 73.84 metres into his next last cast and set the tournament.
His Iceland record in this article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Gudnason, Olympic champion and Iceland’s metastases in a roundabout, won a competition on the thoracic field yesterday but today he competed in a roundabout, his main subject.
Iceland’smet Godna Vals is 65.53 meters [65.53 m], but he threw the longest 59.13 meters [59.13 m] today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson cast the next time today, which had one valid cast that worked for the second seat, 50 feet [49.43 m].
Hafdi's Victory daughter, Iceland's metafie in the farthest, won the farthest jumping race with a great advantage, but Hafdi's jumped a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is nearly 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200-meter run of women, it was the IR-ling Gudbjörg Jona Beardóttir who was sprinkled, but she scored 24.04 seconds, but her Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, who won two gold prizes yesterday, a 100 - foot [100 m] race, and a 40 - foot [4 x 100 m] preaching race, and then also a 4 - foot [400 m] preaching race today.
In the male class, the Kolbeinn family of Gunnarsson from the FH was the first target of the 200 - foot [200 m] race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Muna Samuelsson of the Year.
Like Gudbjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn won gold at 100 yards [100 m] yesterday as well as at 400 meters [400 m] of race.
Does not charge a fine for 27 million crowns of Bitcoin crop
The Overtax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax examiner who demanded a fine on a man for depreciating his financial interests arising from the sale of Bitcoin’s electric coin.
The committee concluded that the tax inspector did not give any clear explanation as to why it was necessary to fine the person.
The committee's decision states that the tax inspector considered that the man had a misrepresentation of taxes due to the financial years 2016 and 2017.
He would have mispronounced his investments that were made because of the sale of the electricity coin Bitcoin of up to 27 million, either on purpose or because of tremendous indifference.
Paying the man for his manners.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, in 2016, he managed to sell 27 million coins.
In 2009 and 2010, Hana would have obtained a burial site when such things had been both easy and uninvited with a regular home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the coins, the tax was taxed because of such sales, they were very vague and unpredictable.
Such tax measures could have been expected for public citizens.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest and would have recognized his property as the basis for a cash bill.
He would have asked both experts and governors how this was going to be but without success.
Then he thought he would have to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others in order to get to know complicated rules that the tax authorities would not have taken a clear view of.
So the man was right to assume that his tax for these two income years would be redefined and taxed, but otherwise he would not be punished.
He then concluded that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here on land since 2012.
He never intended to get away from his duties in an improper way.
The demand for guilt would be totally out of proportion and would throw him into debt.
This man understands what football is like.
Andersen Willumsson's brains have been considerably intertwined with people's teeth, but they have also been impressed by the progress of what's left of the season in Pepsi Max.
The flashlights will be on the fireline tonight when they receive the IA live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
A brunette then takes out four reminders of the season and does not come to play with a new haircut, such as in the games of the summer.
He had written "bla, blah, blah" on his head before the game with HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of the character, this one was rather trying in the game.
He didn't go in hiding.
He wants the ball every time and if there was someone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benedictsson in Pepsi Max's dowry, when considered to be a Brynjølf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to see in what position he is.
He looks out a little to the left when it starts to pass the game, but he has a very free roll in his team," said Hjörvar Haflidason.
Thorkell Máni Petersson says Brynjölf is a real entertainer and rejoices to have such a colorful man in the department: “No one is arguing that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love it with my hair, and always ready to come and answer in interviews.
It's amazing how many people are obsessed with it, which tells me that this man understands what football is like.
“ I’m a entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
People are reading interviews with Brynjölf, people are paying themselves in and watching what's next on their hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moni.
KR player says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in touch with some B-department teams"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his home country, but he must first terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish branch begins before the Icelandic equivalent.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some members of the B Department and will probably change before the end of the Icelandic period.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract at KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to raise his payroll in Denmark.
"The Danish companies have probably felt more of an economic impact than in Iceland."
The Bjartmar wheel has regained a bicycle for millions - now answers by DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had a different hobby from most others.
He knocks up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and vespers.
Bjartmar has earned the name "The Wheelblower".
Yesterday, when you published an account of your relationship with Bjartmar, there was such a stir of feathers.
Then, in a discussion on Facebook, DV pointed out that Bjartmar had spoken to the person in the East and said that the vesp could be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electrician that Bjartmar had theft.
These texts have now been modified on Facebook and the original DV release updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the matter is not at all clear of what really happened yesterday at East Germany.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of an electrocution charge that they were really his electric batons.
This information was given to the injured owner by others, but the information was found to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“ I saw the guy and I knew about the shuttle, but with information that it was an electric bat that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for it.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to take off on the shuttle I decided to go and talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm going very well on such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric bat was just as invited to show him the receipt for the bike, and he himself called the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then, the owner of the electric gun proved ownership of his electric gun and started.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the right owner of the electronic computer told his story on Facebook.
In this large year that Bjartmar has spent his time in this practice, he says he can count on the times he faced people on the fingers of another hand.
“I have had peaceful relations with the hardest people of Reykjavík,” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are most often the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, psychotic people, and other people on the street.
“ The drug is a tough master, and somehow the next dose needs to be financed, because it is a very easy way to achieve that goal, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have many of the good people with me.
There are examples of people going to treatment and getting involved and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with riders on courteous notes.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, rides, and so on.
Theft of bicycles is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even pointing people to talk to him because of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with the previous DV report and says that he is not a self - appointed police officer in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he was not at the heel by his act, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly is.
“ Of course, the police should do this, but the fact is, the police are simply not doing this.
I've got to figure out the police are driving away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's outspokenly outright in these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can make a success in this court, then why not? ” asked Bjartmar.
He claims that he has made so much progress in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he stumbles upon his “handsmen ” on the street that they just got the Bjartmar wheels they had previously gotten to.
The times Bjartmar has called for police help have caused her to fail.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not my bike's own fault," said Bjartmar, and it's a shame that the victims of bicyclefts have to suffer from the emptiness of the police in this squad.
The results of Bjartmar are not shared.
In many places, stories can be found of people who appreciate the benefits of having returned to them.
The Bjartmar himself says that the number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost, but the cost is likely to run in millions, if not millions.
There, electric vehicles, electric bicycles, and electric shafts weigh heavily, but electric wheels can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works for the day at play school, and every other weekend he works in a community.
So his bicycle search is an unprofitable job he does in his spare time.
Lifetime Treasures and Long Shadows
In 2019 there was a great birthday year in the history of bioeconomy funds in Iceland.
True, officials had received retirement from Dana king from all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919, the lifecycle was founded by officials who eventually became the life - certificate of all public employees.
The foundation for the current lifecycle funds of general wage earners was then set up with a comprehensive core contract in the labour market in 1969, where a job-related pension was announced with a compulsory and fully valid fundraising since the beginning of the year 1970.
In 1974 such laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the life - threatening system continued to grow.
The incomes system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor force movement made in its nuclear struggle.
In 1955, unemployment insurance operations had been similar in history, and the organization gradually passed its claims on sickness and sickness benefits, a considerable amount of work rights, a reduction in working time, a improvement in housing, and more.
All these rights cost a great deal of effort, but they proved to be, after all, far greater and more lasting nuclear reform than the increase in the incomes of the payroll, which disappeared as hard as it was in the heat of inflation, which marked the postwar period and up to 1990, as many recall.
In 1969, it was both long and complicated.
Although the funders would eventually come together to become the real property of a fundmate, the union movement had to agree that their governments should appoint representatives of professional and social partners at the same time.
In the following years after the fund was set up, the majority of workers in the fund were often discussed in the fund’s organization, but it was never achieved, so we still have an abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on the discharge of the rights of the economy and the functioning of the bioeconomy funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
It says in the first paragraph that “a life - style treasure should guide the interests of a social partner. ”
Also, the fifth digit says: “A treasure of life will put moral standards in investments. ”
Amongst other things, in the Lifeyrisskats commercial policy, there are the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The White Paper is an integral part of UN PRI rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest bioeconomy funds and professional investment in the Western and European oceans.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good governance of companies, can contribute to improved investment performance of securities.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society differ in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed in the stock market, adopt a public policy: to operate a good governance system for social responsibility and environment.
Gildi, the largest fund in the country, has set itself the “policy on responsible investment” and has a similar law.
It's all reviewed here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word, "shade management".
Since the word is new on the subject, there is no hope that it has been clearly defined, but I now see the following definition as being “most taken”: The shadow management is when a union leader in the media says that he intends to send instructions or instructions to representatives of the society in the management of the bioeconomy fund.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be removed from the government in the first place.
Of course, if the leader does not take this to the media and does not speak of abstinence, it is not “shake rule ”; of course, there is always contact between people in the world of finance as elsewhere.
I’m going to let the reader think about how he feels about “frightier things. ”
There are in particular two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
It is the Hordur Ægisson journalist on the Newspaper, and Ásgeir jonsson, the bank manager.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, President of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the airline's agreements with airlinemen and airmen (declaring them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Trade Union, sent them out the order to represent the company in the management of the Lifeyrissät of traders not to support the possible purchase of shares in the company, nor did they become disfellowshiped.
Some time later, Bogi withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Thor, who, of course, was referring to Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hard and Ásgeir for a number of reasons in the Friday issue of the Newspaper, with great words about shadow control, lawbreak, and the need for legal changes.
There was certainly a small duvet to roll over a heavy cesspool, although the dove had been blessed in the way it had been connected and, in addition, was wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter at the end of the matter.
I found here before the facts in the laws of a bioeconomy fund that are relevant to this matter.
These include the protection of the interests of social partners and the moral standards of investment, and these issues are further explained in both the Gildis and the Liveyris laws of merchants, as I mentioned.
However, life - style funds should NOT look only at short - term land losses in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous and would not have to be long considered in the past, since large banks and funds have gone to immoral adventurers and environmental waste, with disastrous consequences.
The president of Icelandair was obviously on a slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the welfare enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position on investment.
Fortunately, he saw and pulled it back.
Time will reveal whether it is sufficient for investment in life - finance funds in the company to be held accountable to the funders at the time.
An author is a former professor of physics and science.
One of the Infected Ones Did Not Have Homesickness
One of the three identified with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15, about a week and a half ago.
He is, however, an islander who is not regularly resident here, so he was not given clear instructions on how to use so - called return psychiatry after arriving in the country and taking other demonstrations a few days after arrival.
He got a negative scan at the border.
"But he's in an Icelandic community, and he's actually going to do that," says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of psychiatric disease at the Land doctor and a local psychiatric doctor while he's on vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the number and if the number is not registered then you are not automatically announced in the second view."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a resident abroad but because of his connection with the land of Iceland he should have used it rather than Icelandic.
He didn't realize that, though.
“ When the number is not recorded, you need to seek for yourself in the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this is the right way," says Kamilla.
“ So it is clear that while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system, we need to increase our information on it, even though Iceland does not record its own numbers.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic society in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, there are few people around, even though they are identified as members of an Icelandic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six were sent to the pyrexia after he was diagnosed yesterday, and all six were associated with him.
They will still be in the sample, but two of them are beginning to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man was negatively shown at the border of July 15.
Camilla is likely to have recently been infected by the virus that she was not yet able to detect when the vision was taken at the border.
However, she does not wish to rule out the fact that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus to the country.
“It’s not quite possible to claim that this is definitely an intrusion because it’s long since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little war in connection with the sports events. ”
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, stating that it can’t be ruled out until an Icelandic genetic analysis of the virus in the man has been prepared.
"If we get a virus drop that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he carried it to the country."
Pepperprey and Bombs Directed Against Protestants
There was a conflict between police and Protestants in Seattle last night.
The police used peppersprey and illegal handcuffs, but Protestants broke windows and set fire to them.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 policemen were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As stated on the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Subsequently, the police said that the protests were disparaging, and there was a conflict between Protestant and police groups.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by police last August, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of guards came together to demand justice for Brena Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by the police in his home last March.
The group carried firearms and went to prisons at closed gate, where police were responsible for the group of people who protested the Protestants and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white barber in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, football champion of Manchester United, does not want to overdo the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the British league.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end Sunscray and his men in fifth place and thereby lose out of Master Seat.
Then, however, they would still have the hope of getting to the Championship by winning the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t finished yet.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to catch the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
Clearly, human nerves get thin at 3: 00 p.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that each time was different.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure during the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and on this the partner builds.
We have made a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is ours to use it," said Solscär.
“ This isn’t the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football game, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ Bruno Fernandes’s presence changed a lot for us, and I believe that overall we are in a better form and much stronger spiritually than in the last few years, ” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections on a solar cycle
65,490 new viruses were detected in the United States yesterday at John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,478,021 infections have been confirmed at the west sea since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday, the last four days until there were more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, according to the U.S. antiquarian forecast, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000, August 15.
Fear the Second Wave of the Epidemic
Governments in Spain are now trying to restrain the spread of COVID — 19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID–19, both on Thursday and Friday.
No more have been reported in one day at the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanish begin to dispel one of the most stringent curfews in Europe.
The setback led to the British authorities now having passengers coming from Spain to go to the hospital on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on the list of the United States.
The situation is worst in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, where governments have taken on wider limits to try to match growth.
In the capital of Barselon, places of entertainment will be closed for the next two weeks, and altars will be closed at midnight.
Now the curfew is in force for 200 thousand people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is thought that the UK decision will have a negative impact on Spanish economy, which is deeply ingrained by the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, canceled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments in many parts of the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in taking back to an extensive curfew that has devastated the economy in many places.
To form, Mr. Bretis Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very bad turn and compared it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation “will not survive, cheaply or socially ” if it were again taken to a national curfew.
Hopes for local resources that reach the inhabitants of a number of towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to hold back the virus in the next round.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestics
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, plus two additional cases at the border.
Thus five individuals with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
Public protection reports that one of the infections was related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
It has been sent to solitary confinement and 16 years of close association with him.
The infected person was a member of a community sports club in Reykjavík and, according to the report, is “only part of the sports team ” in a disease.
Others who were sent in sickness are otherwise associated with the man.
The source of this infection is undetected and infectious in the full scope of a national police officer’s investigation team.
The ReyCUP convention convention organizers have complied with the guidelines and rules of the current pharmaceutical and public protection and have taken appropriate measures.
However, yesterday the convention’s pictures aroused attention, where a very close association could be seen to celebrate the success of a team on the field.
Just before 11 o’clock today, the conventioners will publish the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads: “ATH: Parents please respect the rules for contestants to pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your insight."
Another infection was detected yesterday, but it is related to the infection reported last morning.
Says the report: “An Icelandic genetic analysis has identified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
In this case, the infectious agent is also involved and is infected in isolation and 12 in the bacterium caused by the infection.
The third infection is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was identified on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close association with him in a pyrexia.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and are being asked for further studies, such as a cross-border activity.
Finally, the report states: The National Police Department, and the district attorney’s office, urge people to exercise caution and to pay close attention to individual infectious agents.
If there is any doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a sample to the nearest health care centre.
Patrez Fjord tells the tent territory of a merchant’s weekend - Direct guests another
The tent of Patre shall be completed on the weekend, according to the word of the West.
Guests are advised to look at other accommodations.
What are the names of the West House of Bildudal, Tolknafjord, Melanes, Red Sand, Flokalund Hotel, and Breðavik Hotel as other options in the position?
There is enough to be on the fairground of this weekend; for as the first year shall be Skäldstadt, the feast of Icelandic documentary images held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
For example, this year’s application to judge the area of the tent can be expected to be a good estimate, if the weather does not take a line into account, but the DV said earlier today from a bad forecast.
But may the worst weather in the south be expected, and the prospect of patrezzars.
The web bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodations in town were already fully booked.
A whole village house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
During the course of the year, the owners of a building permit for remodeling, but their business has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, the largest, and most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavík stands a magnificent multi - country house on three highs.
On the ground floor there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.
The house behind it is a two - level door, each of which contains four rather magnificent apartments.
They range from 93–130 square meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has included video rentals, the Skostudio, the dairy store of the dairy trade, Joa’s gunsmiths, fish sales, and the latest university print.
The house, so mildly spoken, has remembered its ardent beauty.
The house is now greatly damaged, as shown in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 are according to a business directory among Magnús Magnússon and Gudrun Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was a citizen of the City and was a defender of the Civil Society.
Among the owners of the Civil Society is the Steel Ship.
Steel ship, eh., is the investment company of the Gudrun Saint Lárus daughter and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Gudrun and her husband, Augustus Gudmundur Sigurdsson, once drove the ship of steel.
D18 a.m. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore been kept little or nothing since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has steadily worsened since then, but most recently.
On a Facebook site in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not particularly lively in the last year. ”
It may be that owners have spent a few years trying to change the house and its surroundings.
For a long time, other neighbors say the house has not been okay.
"It's a long time to do something nice to this spot and boring that it's been like this."
Does he also say that he is mad at the owners of the house for not getting involved in doing this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this “legislative step”.
"Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can get on with it and finish it."
The 'Legislative step' referred to here is the organization process of the field which has been under way since at least 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were granted permission to build the height of the current apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator building and a building on one floor, as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that purpose was filed with the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee put it to the effect that the project had not been supported by a sub-committee and that the Green Paper was not satisfactory.
Then, in July of last year, Arykjavik City started a divisional work and ended it with an advertisement in the Official Journal.
That organisation was also acclaimed and annulled by the Committee in March 2020.
Thus, at this point nearly three years were passed from the initial application for building permits and the owners of the house at the beginning.
During this time, the house had suffered considerably, and neighbors had become tired.
When DV questioned the neighbor’s situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owner of the house, others not at all.
Others turned their anger toward the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing at all.
Still others said the parking lots, but neighbors have a new unused parking lot under Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicle.
One of the people in the case said that the government was tired:
“ For us to have to go through the process three times, it’s amazing.
It's like the City of Reykjavik didn't know how to read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial of the city’s governments and noble intentions of the owner and of many years of work that is now at the beginning.
When a journalist was parked at Dunhaga 18, a galloped door and garbage heaps blew up.
Playstation computers and recent television were in the midst of another garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer blizzards.
It was opened in the old university print office, and there were numerous cats to judge by the smell of mud.
Clearly, someone has nestled around in one corner, but no one can see.
Stacks of sofas and beds, and a number of pages of geography that were likely to become a book, answered.
The entrances of the apartment house were open as well as life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to bump into the inhabitants of one of them.
Were there Rumen's having a potato dish for dinner and invited a reporter in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and copy DV's sources that the company paid nothing for the building except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it does not seem justified to collect rent.
It is clear from the position of mail in the lobby of the house that there has been a number of foreign workers living there during the last misses.
The driving of employees has not taken part in the Covid-19 situation, the contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction industry and these two industries have been the most effective of using the service of employees.
Nevertheless, the Dunhaga 18 households seemed to have enough work to do and hung the work faults and fields in their partnership to dry up after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be good maintenance.
When a reporter said goodbye to the boys in bed, his irony suddenly became clear: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square feet [1,500 sq m] of real estate is buried.
The owners want to change the house to improve and the neighbors want to improve the situation but argue about the definition of 'benefit'.
In between, the city is organized on a starting ground, the victim of endless appeals, and the concern in the organisational process, and the scaffolding of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
In the house, there are so many Romanian workers, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandic people stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the July 17th D.V.
In pursuit of overweight following a crown virus epidemic
Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds a campaign against overweight, which will include bans on instantbit advertising, following serious illness, in part because of its weight.
In the morning, Monday, Johnson will present the campaign called Better Health, but with the campaign, doctors will be urged to overestimate their patrons’ bicycles and will also fight for the increase in bicycle racing.
Then, according to British media sources, commercials on TV will be banned by 21 p.m.
“COVID — 19 has awakened us to the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become more healthy, more effective and to eat healthy food,” according to the spokesman of the government.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was put in intensive care when he was infected by the crown virus in spring, and that is partly to his weight because he is considered to have become so severely ill.
Women Better Fail to Lead the Changes
She said that the new constitution is the greatest step that the nation can take to increase the distribution, transparency, and to combat corruption and to the benefit of the whole.
“ We need to change gear a bit now, and who better manages to make such changes than the group of society that can be easier at these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s situation.
To stick together and stay together to make changes.
So now we're just about to make these changes."
She said that she was somewhat alarming about the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as willing to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very conscious of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of remote groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
In this regard, she said that women are in many ways in good affairs in Iceland but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders live at enormous male values.
She said that politics turned to make up for their own interests, authority, and power, which were the forces of injustice in all societies.
“ Women have now formed this group and come together and are just a little bit irritated by the fact that the All-U.S. is going to draw a draw to overlook this national measure since 2012, ” she said.
“ It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and the protection of nature, cooperation and that we are all really at the same level," she said, adding that the aforementioned value was the basic values in the new constitution.
“ We are a very rich country of natural resources, and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s chores are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that pilots and nurses have to stand in battle forever just to get the man-heavy pay."
The signature list of the new database can be signed here through the Icelandic electronic system.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the middle of town
A man was arrested in the middle of the night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get some money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in the city of Ártown, where two were arrested for the cause.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver in the Hlida, where its driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn in the night, and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
Then there was a special amount of noise reporting for social gatherings.
Saturday’s evening, a news report on eleven noisy gatherings was published, and it was very much in the police journal.
Tonight, on the other hand, there were 22 noises on the table.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
In the year to come, police were called in the night when they shot fires in the air.
However, they had been spared when police officers were caught.
At that time nine drivers were stopped for drunkenness and or drug - driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the middle of the night, one of them being detained in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency hospital after they fell on the face, one in the middle of the town, and the other in the west town.
One was transferred to an accident ward after he was injured to jump on trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who was driving a trailer at Kjalarnese yesterday.
According to the police’s diary, the trailer was in “very bad condition ” and was stopped.
Can stay in Monet's house on the shopkeeper's weekend
The house in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next free night in the house is about the shopping hall.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Aside from the Airbnb side, it is next available after a week, on the Sunday of the shopkeeper’s weekend, so it might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to book their painter’s house.
The two nights over a merchant’s weekend cost only 964 U.S. dollars or just over 130,000 U.S. dollars as the newsmagazine approaches.
Dozens of the pyrexia and some of them are beginning to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the crown virus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronous virus internally in the last three days and are most of the infected unconnected.
There are dozens of people who have become infected because of this disease, and some of them are beginning to show the signs of the disease that the virus causes.
Three were detected with the coronous virus inside the country yesterday and two at the border crossing.
According to a surgeon’s office, growing numbers of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into society.
“ There has been a serialization from the first domestic infection, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in society at some point.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigriður Josephsdóttir, a specialist in the field of preventive medicine at the county doctor’s office.
Most of the infected have been associated with individuals who came from abroad.
More than a few associated with the infected have begun to show the symptoms of the crown virus.
“Now there’s no flu in the process, and there’s no memory of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal about doing these tests on individuals who at the time of influenza had found reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Infectious activity is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to be exposed to the disease.
Two of the infected were identified after sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether such events can be defended.
Public - protection ministers say it is slow as long as people adhere to rules and standards.
Camilla says almost impossible that the infected were infected at the sports tournaments.
“ If there’s no more isolation from these people after having been around them at these sports events, we can argue that our antiseptics at the conventions have worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
Public Defense's complaints are under constant review.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if this seems to be the reason, ” said Kamilla.
After more than a week, the number of targets will be cleared up to a thousand people.
This new situation may affect our approach.
"Something to think about cooking"--Look at the menu of Elisa Vidars.
Elisha Vidarsdóttir is an accomplished football player and plays with Val.
She is also a professor of nutrition, a mother, and serves as a dietary botanist.
It needs a lot of energy for the day’s work, and it usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day begins to come to work from eight," says Elisha.
"After work, I go to the store to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at play school about 3:00."
Elisha feels very nourishing to bring her daughter to school early.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
She is putting her final hand in a master literature in nutrition, so she knows well how to eat to have enough energy to do her work, school, family, and practice.
“ I find it convenient to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food for bad or good, rather nutritious or dietary.
It's essentially all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I find myself thinking about cooking in the kitchen and getting it very much.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I truly believe that I am a good cook."
Breakfast: oats, chia-fruits, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, laid in almond milk overnight.
Topping this meal with what is available every time.
Most often it is banana and poppy muslin & CAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incrediblely different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shirts with bananas and muslin, bread with a stick, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if appropriate.
Lunchtime: I often make all kinds of foody salads from what is in the fridge, china, or building, falafel balls, rock salad, baked vegetables with a good dress is something I’m working with.
If the organization goes out completely (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has made me quite often saved, and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, no more put on you.
Intermediate: Give me something carbohydrates for exercise, bread with legumes, cereal, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetables.
Police and Protestant Wars in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a revolt following a large number of protests in the city center.
Yesterday, police seized explosive bombs and pepper sprays to try to clear up a large area that Protestants conquered and stretched over many blocks near the town hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that they were investigating damage done at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some sort of bomb.
The civil and police authorities say that Protestants stoned the police with rocks, bottles, ball bombs and other loose weapons, and one officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
Yet, the Seattle convention was peacefully long ahead of us.
The Blues were there to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, but in that city there has been intense fighting between Protestants and heavy -armed states of the federal police.
There, as in other cities of the United States, people gather under the marks of Black Lives Matter, recall Georges Floyds, who was killed by a policeman at Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in American society and demanding an improvement.
Not revoked until after vote
It is not yet possible for the cancellation of the cancellations to be made by the airlines of Icelandair, which will take effect at the next month’s time.
Iceland's air carrier airline agreement is due to end at noon tomorrow.
The Society’s Chairman, Líney John’s Daughter, assures us that Icelandair will not make a decision on the cancellations until the conclusion of the voting is reached.
"It's very close to each other," says Gudlaug Líney.
“ There have been no cancellations; this must be done in order to make man - made machines possible.
So, of course, people are anxious to know if they will have a job after the month."
The agreement was signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by pilots.
On July 17, Iceland’s Government and the Committee of Trustees agreed to announce a full-time job in Iceland, and they agreed to vote for it.
It never came to her, but it was decided after the decision of Icelandair to terminate talks with the airline company, cancel all her flight friends and search for agreements with another union.
Then the pilots of the company were to take up temporarily the work of a parasitic team.
Asking how she believes that the vote will go, Gudlaug Líney says that it is difficult to tell.
“ People are in pain after this visit to Icelandair, when all the pilots of the company were canceled and announced that they would be negotiating with another union.
Now it becomes apparent whether it has any effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 airliners worked at the Icelandic Air, and then 900 of them, about 95%, were abandoned.
Their abstinence is varied, with those with a shorter working life, it is three months and ends at the month of July-August.
In this group there are about 90% of Icelandic airlines.
What will the agreement be accepted?
“ Then we wish for continued discussions with our listeners.
With this deal, we're meeting the demands of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the pilots have gone too far."
The vote will be closed and Icelandair will announce a second quarter tomorrow.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon.
The stocking of Icelandair for another quarter of a year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results suggest that the company’s income has dropped by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic vote on the air carrier agreement for Iceland and the Icelandair Association began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, on Monday, July 27, at noon.
Those allowed to vote for the contract are the employees of Icelandair who pay social contributions to the airline company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new core agreement on Sunday, July 19th, but on Friday, after the flight attendants broke a previous agreement in early July, Icelandair had broken negotiations with the company.
Then, on Friday, Icelandair had canceled all the pilots and pilots of the company, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new core contract.
According to a new core contract, pilots need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement dates back to 2025, where pilots and pilots have agreed on how long one shift can be flown.
The contract was presented to FFI members at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, describing many airlines that were talking to them about dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement to keep FFI alive had to be accepted.
The launch of a second quarter of the year will take place tomorrow, while the EBIT, its operating result for finance and taxes, is negatively about 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion U.S. dollars, according to preliminary results.
In the past Wednesday, Icelandair sent the department’s preliminary calculations, which said that the company’s income earned about $60 million on the quarter or $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, around $20 million, the amount and the amount of it were some 154 million U.S. dollars.
Icelandair also aims at offering the company's share in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with 15 borrowers, governments, and Boeing aircraft manufacturers by the end of a month before the partial stocktaking mission.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“ A new virus only means that it has been a foreign person.
This is not something that has been maiming inland, ” says Már Kristjánsson, head of the National Hospital’s infectious disease department, saying that “new types of virus ” have been identified here on land.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two by the border.
One who was diagnosed had been involved in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer tournament, but the source of the infection was undiscovered and infectious.
An individual who arrived in the country on July 15 also detected an infection and two associated individuals who began to show the symptoms of COWID — 19.
Yesterday, a disease related to last night’s disease was detected and post serial analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis revealed “a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
Immunisation is complete in association with that infection.
It is clear that it is not a new virus, it is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It would be better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and whether it could say something about the beginning of another wave of epidemics, Már says that as there is a single incident, and it could be no more.
“ However, if there are cases of domestic non-relationships with the same genetics as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw the conclusion [about a second wave], but it is premature to do so,” explains Maur.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret of happiness hidden in the hot tubs in Iceland?
BBC planners lead to the likes of a fun video that sheds light on national swimming pool and hotpot culture.
The Icelandic baths are unique to the world, and it is claimed that no one in the world has the same number of baths in every population.
The natural earth’s heat is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of the sinning that prevails here.
The education of children was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less capable of using hot water to improve their health.
Health travel is described as a solid part of the country’s general well - being.
Everyone in the pot is equal, regardless of the position.
The cell phone has been opened and people talk about personal issues around the home and space or enjoy the likeness of the water: meditation and loading of batteries of soul and body.
On the way to pick up a hundred days in elections
A hundred days are until the United States elections and elect presidents until the age of four.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he has to pick up the track.
Joe Biden, who is expected to represent the Democratic Party, has much advantage over Trump on a national scale, taking into account the polls.
According to the recent AP survey, the number of Americans estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump’s reaction to the pandemic of the new crown virus is also very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans believe that the president has been misguided by economics.
In fact, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response to the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has kept good economics.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden has 49.9 percent of the population, but Trump has 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw his attention to the epidemic of Biden, promote so - called cultural strife, and promote policies that are designed to change law and order.
Biden’s performance, however, strives to keep Trump’s attention high on the odds of winning if the election is really about Trump’s performance in the last four years.
The unpopular Trump also seems to come down to the Republican Congressmen and fear for the future that the Democratic Party could even reach the majority of the U.S. Congress of Honour, which has so far been very much agitated.
Politico reported on the days of being a member of a group and a candidate comparable to what is now the Republican Party would be the greatest outrage in decades.
Environment has been particularly bad in the 2016 Congress elections, and now it looks as if this trend will continue.
During the last few days, Trump has tried to scare the inhabitants of the suburbs into following him, including by becoming President Biden, he will destroy the United States’s suburbs and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a rule from Barack Obama in the White House, which was designed to increase the variety of environments.
Then he urged the U.S. “housewives ” to read an article by former deputy director of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the United States’s suburbs and accepted Trump.
“ Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it better!" said the president.
The population of the United States is an ever - increasing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half the votes in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received majority votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite the close commitment of Trump in the 2016 districts, he has been closely joined by others.
Although there are differences between the examiners, Biden has measured about 15 percent of Trump’s advance in the past.
Regis Philbin is dead.
American television player Regis Philbin, aged 88, is dead.
Philbin served as an actor, participant director, introduction, and singer for about six decades.

He received six Emmy awards for a career and was nominated 37 times.
His family’s statement states that Philbin died of natural causes.
The number of collaborators, friends, and admirers mentioned him on the public media last day.
Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the corridors?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that have only world wars up until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that Olympic Fire would be famous “the light at the end of the corridors, ” pointing to the world’s world empire as a global warming virus.
There are years more to prepare for and compensate for the delay by Japan’s authorities.
Everyone, however, keeps a big head at stake.
When Tokyo, Japan, was announced to be the scene of the Olympics this year, the cheer of the Japanese representatives was genuine.
They cried and laughed at each other, but Tokyo had applied to keep the games in 2016 but had lied to it at a lower level for Rio, Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to be caught in the world’s attention.
The games were scheduled to take place on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021, and ending on August 8, 2021.
If you can't keep the games then, if the crown virus gets too threatened, the games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think that way to the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be wonderful and strive to top the last games.
A choice of a city for Olympics is based on the election committee’s assessment of the city’s presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to be made.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the 2016 Olympics or an estimated $20 billion.
For the second time, when the 2020 games were applied, $75 million, about $10 billion, was introduced.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to have the games this year, the Japanese authorities had such a $30 billion worth of money spent on the project.
However, that amount is only a drop to the sea, according to the cost of building Olympic villages, stadiums, and, in general, to strengthen the interior of the country to handle, prepare, and keep the games themselves.
Japan’s organizers have said that Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be going on these days but have been postponed for about a year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government surveyor in Japan, published at the end of last year, revealed that the cost was almost double that.
It is likely that the cost of postponement cannot be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars at an additional initial cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers may run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
It is so high that all taxes of the Icelandic state do not last for nearly half the Olympic Games, compared with the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of the magnitude of the fact that they have often become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, many people have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are less than positive to the economy of the cities that hold them.
Some, for example, are short - term jobs, but for a long time cities tend to sit up with debt and high - risk operating costs for small - time employees.
Rio, Brazil, is heavily indebted for the 2016 games and has been in trouble to support all the big sportsmen’s activities built for the games.
According to the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed earlier.
This means that only a small amount of new jobs were involved.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in keeping Olympics financially because of the daunting cost of human activities built for the games.
However, the prize is often considered to be an increase in the tour of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, but there is much uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether you can accept all the numbers of viewers who usually attend the games.
However, the main thing is the privilege that cities have to be given, but it is difficult to value money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it may also be said that the joy the games bring is not the kind of value that can be placed on it.
Of course, this is not just about money.
The sports heroes are in the foreground.
For some of the performers, it is surprising just to be happy to delay the games.
For example, the Australian 5-year-old and gold medalist, Chloe Esposito, in his article on the site of the Olympic Games, is a cassette and would have been far from being a good sport in summer, but there is no hope of being in competition for the 2021 games.
Thus, she is among the athletes who are rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who were about to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some cases the delay of the games means that they will end the race before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of strict exercise.
Few athletes lived as extensively in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and the gymnasium Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his country of origin in the United States recently to discuss Olympic Games.
She plans to play the 2021 games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of next year’s games, so she will be 24 years old.
Although generally not considered to be high age, it is at a higher level for a female gymnasium in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles at another interview published on the Instagram website of the Olympic Committee, asking whether it intends to reach the same length in the 2021 games as it did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’ll be at the top after a whole year of practice, ” says Biles.
She has spoken of her body’s failure to cope with the stress of gymnastic training much longer.
Nevertheless, she is a champion of the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic was at its height and the gym was closed.
Biles was no exception, but all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to keep in shape like others.
Certainly, the basic form is slightly better than that of most people.
“We have a tight plan now.
It was difficult to start rehearsing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back on track, and I’m going to increase my practice even as I go on in the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we still practice for the sake of their being.
I've put too much effort to leave the sport now," says Biles.
Like other skeptics, she may be more aware that the situation may come up that the games are not held at all in 2021 either.
Foretelling this, however, is hopeless.
No one can know how to prepare for the Olympic Games in July 2021 for the pandemic of the crown virus and what else to do in July 2021.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
Experiencing an Epidemic Wedding
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was due to marry former Bachelor of Arts contestant Well Adams this summer.
“I think it’s other more important things to think about right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We would love to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all those present who love us.
But we decided to delay and focus on what is important now, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I'm looking at world affairs more than wedding issues these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
