AM in Wales is anxious to "appear as a puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal will be subject to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Wales Parliament.
AM across the entire political spectrum is concerned about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who can't Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means pajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative Welsher said that his group is "open" to the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh like the letter U in Yorkshire.
Assembly Commission, which currently prepares legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation are to be called is clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly of Wales.
The current title of AM proposed by the Commission is Welsh Parliament Members (members of Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
AM apparently proposes other options, but reaching consensus problems can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what to call when debating legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on changing its name
On Sunday, voters will vote if they are to change the country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The follow-up vote is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of names is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem encounter problems
"Elder people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People hang out in other ways these days," he said.
"Children are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
The churches in force are concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders expect and that "before or later they will end up on the square again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with properties filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closing of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments probably will not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, which refused to employ or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor".
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the major watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the recent months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some entrusted with the church's playmanship, others of the episcopal foundation.
The church assembly – the congregation’s governing body consisting of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church assembly, even though the church assembly had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Shark hurts 13-year-old who dives for lobsters in California
On Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who died after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first believed that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire key bones had been worn up.
"I called for everyone to get out of the water. "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his permission is stated to be critical.
It's unclear what a shark it was.
The bathing guard Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's entering Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's tackle Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department stores with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s attempt to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said that they intend to double their beauty range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get larger space with marked areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The retail chain also launches its boutique makeup brand again so that most of the products are vegan – which more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look increasingly like warehouses in an effort to fight against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stand since they bought both chains two years ago, which according to them has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The early purchase attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, $125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty paths a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide advice to customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "razzling" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragon's Den-star Peter Jones is "rare" because TV director Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time with their brand Truly, with leisure wear and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den-star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle mark in the last minute – to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “raining” at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1,5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly Holly's primary priority.
It would be her long-term future for the decades to come.
Her decision to get out of shock shocked all those involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that the decision of this Morning Presenter to withdraw could cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as Chairman in March.
Couples spend vacations together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Tough talk, and then we fell in love.
He joked that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy of a president" and that he was so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman's heart":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
More than three months after the Singapore meeting in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "representative response" from the USA after the first North Korea disarmament step.
He noted that instead the United States continues to impose sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
" North Korea's doing great," he said.
"We were about to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relations with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, liberated hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroys island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost their homes, a state of emergency was not issued, which is required for international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which is what complicates it all," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Saving the children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson of the Natural Disaster Bureau, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for nature’s anger.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite the warning issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia's many islands.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital vessel anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rail.
But poor funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressed by lingering sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge signed last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was down by 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the remote pole.
The attempt flew high across the target area towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to access the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approach and didn't think so much about it but just fired."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a goal for 25 minutes from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue knitter put a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spined off close to the center field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the center field.
Then he got a great kick that brought Hazard into the finish line.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball online at the remote pole with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights for Naples at the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is opposed to VIdeoton in the Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death rate in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the ruins of buildings that fell in the earthquake at 7.5 that hit Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the firm’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rushes from buildings that were demolished.
The police arrest you, 32, suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has begun after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman who was found living in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's immediate relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one should come in or go out of the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can come back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the fence and another just outside.
A number of police officers were in front of the fence with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are sent a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of a dispute over the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical puritanic followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "presence" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The Iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe Error Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 1800s and is part of the historiography of a man who many still consider should be hailed.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be hailed and celebrated.
Homicide kills peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a breast artery and covered in blood in a stia on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject the vaccine into pigs in a piglet on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a scumbag nearby was open.
He said there was a big grishane in the swine with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin who is identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported negotiating for compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 pound pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it off.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're nafs, they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Pink for extensive rain to the southwest USA
As foreseen, the hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a windpower of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a tropic is formed across the Pacific Ocean and heading east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearby trough will create vastly heavy rains in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that someone step out into the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons foreshadowing rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around sand.
The nearby trough, of course, brings local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flows and slipways.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may involve intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the Tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost ten degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of central and eastern USA are expected to get a warm start on October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the northeast USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great opportunity for warmer temperatures than the average in the East in the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million looked at Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they had a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was hanging on to her when he was drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They counted average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people looking from offices.
By comparison, it is as many viewers as for a football match in the playoff or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had the largest number of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators screaming at him when he tried to take an elevator to an interview with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in the live broadcast by CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said that he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks sent live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would pass on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, as the minority democrats have claimed.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has started an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the UK and the EU collect each other's customs duties was "fully unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS' subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and into the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for the police's intervention team, the police's police law lab, the Southern University police and residents in the area for the help of the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flying and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Last Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
The volcano asks ash about Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and they registered 183 emissions of gas and ashes during the 24 hour course.
The center discovered several mulls and scavenger.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists for the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the demonstrations of independence hit together with the riot police, while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on the Secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by the claphallpolis threw eggs and dyed powder on them, resulting in dark ponds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles also broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the Independence Groups called "Never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried out "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local press.
The referendum is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted in favour of independence, but participation was low when most people opposed to the Secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Self-confidence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration still took place, but had to take another route.
Electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatists' protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will be independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty keeping the driving force up this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-inflicted exile or are in detention awaiting trial about their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been four times by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
Last Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since the end of last year, announced that he is going to run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to compete with the European Parliament is to condemn the return of democratic values and the undermining we have experienced from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into the house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingstone 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas' strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided second with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's page still hasn't got a boon in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, the next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning line to six games – the main coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingstone misses chances of having two visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their integrity gave Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after having glided in to measure Craig Halkett's nick across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the crucial goal was made.
Rangers gave up a frispark and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the finish area.
At that time Rangers had dominated the ball, but home law defense was inconceivable and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingstone's determined games.
Crossings were constantly entering the Livingstone target area and handled without problems. Two penalty requirements – following Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Each one was unique and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall right through.
But Rangers missed inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not keep the mark – they only opened the home side once – and it is one of the alarm clocks for Rangers, which is in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smiles and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany at breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become dissatisfied with human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from being gathered outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The doubling protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and condemned as an enthroned ruler of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in shock by car
A cyclist died in a crash with a car in London.
The body took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traveled road in Deptford, southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and medical staff were called there, but the man died on the spot.
The hook takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childrens Street, about 1.5 km from the hook on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and car drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in trouble at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialized "torna doves" have been called there to deal with the troubles, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor damage to the face.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "In particular trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may have extended prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to the prison to deal with serious troubles where staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy pulls out over the desert in the southwest of the United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "tio tropical cyclones have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border".
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with insulated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest United States, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rains can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Dryt Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
The Hurricane Rosa will first travel across Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Sea, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may get heavy rain, which represents a considerable risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay streams in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to their cell phone to show up.
Trump says Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the democratic party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthlessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "began to suffer from evil, anger" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress of Thursdays and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he was sexually assaulting her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"One voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most competent legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats are trying to resist and hinder.
The first final vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of elevations
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the dusk and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamin came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of immediately running away, and they fell victim to tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin was not alone but dragged cars, logs and houses. It hit everything in its path," said Nugroho. He also said that the tsunami had traveled on the high seas for up to 800 km/h before the hit coastline.
Some climbed up trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftersalv still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's agency for evaluation and application of technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times the amount of nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found during the crash of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is near the earthquake epicenter.
The communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"There are over 300 000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Office was criticised on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about tsunamis to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water will crash to the beach and sweep away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to an extensive power outage that disrupted all communications around Palu, which made rescue efforts difficult for the authorities.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for assistance work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu, where they seek protection under tarpaulins on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseca.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the bitter aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if exemptions are declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up dire natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers saved a woman who had been in a state of distress for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of Indonesia’s national screen flight team, had trained two of the missing screeners before the Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier in the month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandaki, were his students.
"As the paratrooper, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after the monitors heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray goat, instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 under ATM filling at Newport on the Livee
Last Friday morning, thieves stole $26 750 from a Brink's employee who filled up a ATM at Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "Another man ran up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspect escapes from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapparen changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes names – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which set off for "contemporary reasons" according to the programme's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he was talking about the title of his album with radio value Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who's changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has previously signed its name with and without binding lines and capitals.
Mexico's AMLO swear not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Tlatelolco Plaza last Saturday to "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era of left-wing student movements rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and poor educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
US should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming head of AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
A twice as large budget can double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough being made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most outstanding AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that beat the highest ranked American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the US government, such as the Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders away from us, but companies," said Lee.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think that green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students within AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organisations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia referendum on change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum if the country's name should be changed to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece which has prevented its efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a requirement on its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of names would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubts if the minimum participation of 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid will be achieved.
The issue of the ballot in the referendum is this: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing names is worth allowing Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia was split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The follow-up vote is not binding, but sufficient Members of Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change in names requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's sake, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the European Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not sneak in through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to a necessary investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonia Policy Survey Institute, between 30 and 43 percent of voters thought in the referendum, which is below the minimum level of participation required.
According to another study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought that they would vote on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be counted, 50% of registered voters plus one vote will have to be taken.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes over the entire Brighton's defenses to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine barber got a pass from the center field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and walked out into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forwarder used his first kick in the finish area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial take-over in the Premier League match.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's revir at that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the outpost.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net moment before it ended out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competitive Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance for the playoffs.
Rockies got a wild card spot with a win of 5-2 over Nationals last Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals hasn't announced their start for Sunday yet, but according to reports they're leaning against letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen last Thursday and would throw on his normal vilos Sunday.
Washington's right-handed thrower is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds talks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming middle elections.
"All that we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, their terribleness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them have it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to resist and hinder.
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, "and he called the Democrats "arga and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was handled by the crowds.
"Remember what she said?
"Did you leak the document?"
'Eh, uh, right?
No, no, no, I'm expecting a...' It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we're not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically enough similar subjects to which Jeremy criticised previous leaders.
The message about the meeting with Nottingham East Labour last Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "kinder, warmer" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly obvious that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of the party's leaders accepting it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues like me once thought had a similar political vision that I expected me to make a full turnaround and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – I follow a tiger of ignorance on social media that requires me to be put off, criticise my policy and say that I shouldn't even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era's policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party is getting narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so it's going to be okay.
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher’s government’s neglect that literally caused my elementary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to you, who promoted the profession last Friday, that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would like to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of devoting me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this lovely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and the coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and are still unbeatable, so we are so obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland's Captain Rory Hughes, who was released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose speak the numbers and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a leadership of 17-5 during the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait after a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the reboot Ayr increased the management again with an attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose once again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball McPherson made a touch down from the penalty-line out behind the Ayrs moul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flank Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford K runs seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been entered as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming 9th season will be the last of the series, and K run seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's CEO of Adriebmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that K runn wanted to enter Glasgow's "flowery restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rich-kept headquarters for the La Paz fleet.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s remains strong – and it is also the desire to sail on the Pacific.
This hope is higher than in decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court on the first of October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the drive, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and is so clearly awaiting the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them their own outlet to the sea.
Monday's decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who is facing a controversial struggle for reelection next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court judges in favour of Bolivia, and that even if it does, not much would change.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been more damaging than promoting Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been cut by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She argues that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has caused pain in Chile's continuing well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this, President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will provide "a unique opportunity to launch a new era for relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of mutual-benefit differences," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin American’s most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move forward from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour the promises made during a Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the deadlock of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "vote dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement to end the Korean war will ever tame North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want one more summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a armored hall that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge headbands on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of tricky, oversized headbands for their SS19 collection on catwalk, which dazzled the stylicons of Paris fashion week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s chief creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a featherlike wide hat briquette that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled water melons, a sorcerer hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in due time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn up lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wet suit with snorkeling and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass rod.
And if you continue the tremendous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats can be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come just after La Bomba – the straw hat with a britches of 60 cm that have been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label that was behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out yet another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that held it.
The Raffia bag in terracotta, with Raffia lashes and a white leather handle, was excellent at Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris fashion week.
Kendisstylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, his heart will go to him."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students studying mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as choice of subjects are now considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17% attributed to a lack of language skills.
With this in mind, language skills become all the more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult British people published by YouGov in 2013, 75 per cent answered that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only total language in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Speaking several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland every school learns different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered the most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and bring them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly languages that continue to be crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's young people.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the first season game of Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by his candidate to the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for future mid-year elections, since the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress before the forthcoming elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense after accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in voting from the Senate for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
So President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Conference control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named Reuters.
Night's events, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been trailing into the polls.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University national scientist, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive before Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions the competitions of Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swirling pendulum of the moment is a fully invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in front of races like these.
So what is the momentum now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we wear it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and prefers with good example.
The vintage rolled even higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive putt to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had left with two after two games.
His pit that won them the match of 15 met with a similar wreath, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
Europe's odd but adorable couple are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a booky on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the audience's reactions state that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could bring home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero in the morning, together with Alex Noren.
One bookey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spaniards and Swedish into a hole they never even got close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the last day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting glow that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out from Saturday's four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really started in the morning's four-ball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend is just the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into four-ball, they beat a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more repressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed off a few moments of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's four-ball and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a substation of four points in the single matches, however, the Furyk side needs only an undecided result to keep the trophy.
After being the next best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they'll disarm one-sidedly without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and it was not possible for it to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that during the past year North Korea had taken "significant measures to demonstrate its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassemblying installations for nuclear tests and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to an approach divided into stages for nuclear power that would lead to North Korea’s being rewarded when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, since it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on "the decommissioning of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to negotiate to alleviate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "dissolution first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even object to "the declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for those who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the US leaders highlighted earlier in the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party on this matter of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the US, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a deadlock."
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US continent with rockets was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "bring to ruin" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the execution of sanctions by the Security Council must continue with force and without failure until we realise complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stifle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea however accused him a few hours later of setting "goster-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "representative measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course of getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled "days".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often inconspicuous when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health care services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In a part of the course there is an image of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants will learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "during" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that lack of sleep was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain because sleeplessness puts the brain in starve mode and makes them ever hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has studied one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn around on the day, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas target lowers Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas' strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was after taking home its first victory on the road since February's 4-1-triumf on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
Menga struck to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never evened out the result.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and lies just behind Hibernian on target.
And there may be more problems with Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-skilled games surpassed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been goal already two minutes into the game when Menga's first pass let Scott Pittman through to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle fielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A Frispark in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the rear pole.
Rangers took control of the game, but it looked to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo surely felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waived the Colombian call.
Rangers managed only to score two goals in the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tam kick from Oviedo Ejaria.
Lily's opening shots in 34 minutes may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servant deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher suited Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the exchange gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingstone continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead in the final stage, but McGregor did well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had yet another late demand for punishment when he was tamed by Jacobs, but once again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manikin called Geigerometer.
Geigermätter has become a foundation for science since then and also portrays great in pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", with the leading role in the seemingly unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-injected
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovary cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "prevents the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a hilarious appearance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town called where he was wearing a Make America Great-Keps, he rallied against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I'm talking to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the charges of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the play of West's interpretation was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also regretted to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his main residence.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to go low?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burops at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said, "It was deadlock in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with his appearance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOU TO BE AFTER THE MOBB."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") whom I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we, she added.
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparkollegen, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Those for attempted murder after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhakkamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to arrive at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Strikes Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his playmate in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also admitted 31, that he feels "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV can partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculineity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men".
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in a new recording by Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits character Jon Snow falls in love with, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family owners in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted via six and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 from year to year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is an acute issue in the Chinese HBV community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBV people is said to be widespread.
Because of its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men sooner or later will marry women.
Many of the cases are caused by insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that personnel leaked the GOP senator's data, shields "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, US congressman Maxine Waters denounced allegations that one of her employees had posted personal data on three republican US senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claimed that these claims were disseminated by right-wing extremist websites.
"Liars, lies and more reprehensible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information was reported to contain home addresses and telephone numbers to Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came up online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate Panel hearing about the allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly got criticism online, including from Vita Huset's former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They must not be proud.
They must not question the motives of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of seeming angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters in the middle of the mandate period also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Fuck about the truth," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Against - Powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit benefits in every new film with British tilting, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys that was kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satir be about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export goods?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been granted its license to rescind the business for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comical creation intended for the bio-public even in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims for smoothieglamour, has received a small piece of Clouseau, a grunt Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man like Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades hit his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is displayed, but the humor feels rather low and strangely superfluous, especially since the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is strangely perceived not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie grandfather in the role of Bean.
The current issue is now that Britain is facing serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's supersecret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents in the field, to the agent in the great discontent of service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-pressed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teres-May character but the script does not offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the stuttering Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with its previously long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a subcaptain, a jolly-hokey-stick-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and bump into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain's computer trouble: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of far-like performances: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on board Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to familiarize himself with the inside of Volta's house.
There are certainly a lot of jobs behind the latter sequence, but although the film is both charming and fast-filled, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderate of everything.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that a plan is being drawn up to work a four-day week for British workers, but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that is based on the British working a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
The party claims that business leaders leave savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: An audit of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day week of work is an effort that fits into the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens who promised a four-day work week during their election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not listed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day week of work is not the party's policy and that's nothing the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "sniggers" at state companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellors also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get their whole effort back, because a Labour government can make "reductions" because of what they perceive has been wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, who then claim to receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us in the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the Office's investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their position on the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened that the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and that would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive array of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to fight world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people wandering to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, email a world leader, ring or other meaningful ways to increase awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen announces that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the collected assets have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are committed to "helping children to develop to their full potential", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help fight malnutrition in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustices as malnutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman's ambassador to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5000 measures were taken requiring the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes dietary programs targeted at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: "what makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "There will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicating the Minister for the Interior
The government can "if necessary" use its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it is working on the invitation from the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"U.S.A. has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "vote of energy consumption" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day-to-day" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
After the Trump administration has set itself the goal of increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American position was set back by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike the fact that a third party is disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take an "ordinary thinker" if she is to stand up for the Presidential elections in 2020," says Massachusetts Senator.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the US's mid-year elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a real thinker to run to the Presidential post."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open-minded in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We obviously need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe that she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The study showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
The prayer said that he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking over in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma that our soldiers are returning with," she said to the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempted to prevent a report on domestic violence and weapons possession in drunken conditions, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee gang-related violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the trials in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberty Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members" abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a decision of immigration authorities from 2014 allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances to which the claim applies, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the-court report.
In the report, lawyers further argued that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the US economy, and argue that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death rate doubles in the pursuit of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked all the more gloomy.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance is picking up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a defect."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooted by water-damaged possessions and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, settled outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors because of continued strong aftershock.
With tearful eyes, he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't run.
I was pressed into the walls ruins, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling at help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying an addition to Des Moines Register - the state of Iowas best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the US 6th Congressional election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other's imports.
China's early trade war tariffs were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa that support the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and the former long-standing Governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday's Moines Register, "is now doubling the bullying by putting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," said Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of different voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economy, as the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party with the iron hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters before the mid-year elections through Kavanaugh Fiascot, warning analysts
Since many top republicans defend the Supreme Court’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh who is facing several accusations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be setbacks, especially from women, during the forthcoming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It is not possible to turn the clock back," says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been loud, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still undetermined female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, even though they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Prior to Ford’s public testimony with accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could be followed if Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a mess for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they have dealt with her," said Guy Cecil, head of the United States of Priorities, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the wake of Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying under his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as they have from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Justice Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her violently at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that that candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solidly allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons are given access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data large" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, to do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a web browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed at the top of a night.
"We're not asking them permission."
In a post published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, the Berners-Lee Internet was transformed when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest awarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I celebrated
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during the First World War is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglice and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the firing line and led with "great bravery" the line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "recognised himself very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a true hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stopped up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you've stopped up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were not impressed after they had stayed awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed children's program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President for Marketing and Communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Greta pig, yes"
Bellators CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the reprise," said Coker.
"But there's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change upset many people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But in fact, it was a state question.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five games instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that felt inferior to his peers during his childhood because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about homosexuals' rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken some months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on the Laverna's first program, Daley tells us how he felt "less worth" than others during his childhood, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worth me and feeling different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone", he said, so he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly profiled advocate for the rights of the HBT, using his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscars winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole life perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the 2012 Olympic Games in London - where he wanted to sit on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him, you won't be able to sit on the front line, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally admitted he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience in an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song election - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the Olympics and that still gave him horrors.
Desert Island Discs are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will beat the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-balls and four-somes.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day acting cheerleaders and practicing his game in hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track at Le Golf National, where the long call often punishes hard.
It is not only the track that deters, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets the champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the novisen Tommy Fleetwood won all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single matches have wind at the beginning, Mickelson's match can be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has added so much to these teams in previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd make it through more, but now it's what it is and we're gonna have to settle for it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo passes the record for most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven half, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last day’s singles in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under the leadership of Seve Ballestero held a five-point advantage over the Americans but who finally won with the least possible margin with the result 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You are reminded that we led big on Valderrama, we led big on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and touch," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow, we'll give it all.
Go outside and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the score on the board.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I've said it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what's waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was pleased with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are true, and that is quite another thing.
It's nice to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It's the message you need to communicate to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to go out and get the best of himself."
In contrast to Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the tempo starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these middle matches.
We made our stand and placed the guys that we wanted for, you know, to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany’s New Warships Set Back
The latest frigate of the German fleet would have been launched in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Palatinate", the guide for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg Fridays, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were devastating for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen Fridays.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of military and marine missiles, as well as some sneakers, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are put into operation, writes Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 Friday created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware goods" that made the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Lacks in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older ferries in the Bremen class.
It also appeared that the ship has a significant excess weight, resulting in impaired performance and limits the ability of the marine to perform future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonnes heavy Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the entire project’s price tag – including the training of the crew – is also a problem.
It is said to have amounted to swindling EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up phase.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s maritime power is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually "starts with a shortage of fully equipped vessels".
The official said this was a growing problem, as old ships were dismantled but no replacement vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Enemies to Bat Secret Life
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to controlling future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwarf pipistrell as well as brown lenders and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bats and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed spatial view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest land for bats and other related species.
Flat muscle populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the yield and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as domestic attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localisation technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Owner David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of winter trees and a variety of beneficial habitats.
But there is much about bat that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasises the importance of searching for bats before carrying out maintenance in properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to sue the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him "false news" and says that people "will market themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal's and Juventus forwards have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He claims to have paid her 375,000 dollars to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) ignored the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after reporting the requirements.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good," said the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to meet Der Spiegel over claims, as they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount equal to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "fear of retribution" and was worried about "be humiliated publicly".
34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in the summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain would "repent it forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily cease production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems are what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and hence would have to stop production.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "extremely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4:'s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said: "We have put forward an exact and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shot in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential barrier to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby jeopardising Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's squawks for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing the listening equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of devoting the president via the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports that he was about to leave appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual infidelity, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it may be this week, or a one-week post, considering all the other things that happen at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would contest the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to any disparity with TV reporters who "played for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President will hold more questions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States it's infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the collective reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland in view of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public sector.
Freeman wrote in the letter: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit have continued, before decisions are expected to come this autumn.
But the UK Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line back Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after being hit by a head injury in Saturday’s loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodore, reported Tennessean’s Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage happened just before half time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a stretcher was taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the hospital Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/scale of the injury yet" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a season total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamping tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamping tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Tory Party.
The measure will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the excise duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The UK Finance Department expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of housing with more affordable prices and targeting high-income beneficiaries.
The increase in the tax on stamps will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The extra money will give a shot at the government's effort to combat homelessness.
The additional levy is added in addition to the current excise duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in leisure dwellings and dwellings purchased to be rented out, which may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will attract up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 per cent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by people living outside the UK. This drives prices up and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold on the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new play comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to renounce quotas in housing with affordable prices to solve Britain's "necessary housing situation."
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a spectacularly rich proposal for housing reforms, including rent cuts and an end to vomiting without the tenant's cold.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and also for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for hard working residents in our country.
The dream of owning your home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to eventually become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old Scotsman looks forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from north-eastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-land team and that's all," says Ross to the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up I looked very much at Scotland at Hampden with my father, and it has always drawn me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club."
Ross' representatives as trainer for Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about following such established names in such a large club. He has previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I judge the success based on the answer to the question, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club definitely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month-long victory as a member of Heart's coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from demise to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close down to becoming the winner of the championship title next season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crossroads," he recalls and refers to when he took charge of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had okay results and could live well on it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot you have to get through every week.
There's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels right.
I have always wanted to practice and now I do. I feel better than I have ever done throughout my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat bulb has meant increased revenue for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have been given greater pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the company advisory company CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we had to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%. The restaurants, however, had even greater difficulties.
The reduction in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars offering drinks in particular showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Puberty offering food was also difficult in the beautiful weather, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The results of managed pubs and bars went up by 6.6% that month, and food sales down by 3%."
Paul Newman of the servering and entertainment analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in the sale of large kitchens.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a reduction in sales of 4.8% per year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have been more inappropriate for companies that are driven by food sales. The time may show if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some needed response."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyses data on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that there is sexual content being put up there
20% of the students reported having a "head account" that they showed for their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create accounts on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram imaging service.
The result has been late because there is sexual content posted there.
20% of the students reported that they have a clean "head account" that they can show to their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother tripping over her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who encouraged others to "violate me."
According to the study, conducted by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of the pirates" on the board of the Scottish Federation of Liberals, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as an external member of the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free-goer, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sport to take advantage of her wide-ranging experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for sports and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had to be shown if I was to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows sharing internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers with cows that get milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump," the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humorous means to show what freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a heady barn with cows to a song with lines of text like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a jewel, it's tits."
The trace continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 shows and hundreds of comments, and has encountered mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it throws light on the dairy industry's "fasses".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their kids are taken away from them just a few days after birth," one person writes.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But certainly, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another adds: "What a reality-based commercial film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would've gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another comments: "This is a fun commercial film that turns to moms who pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like "kisses."
This isn't a movie that salutes or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a nursing system, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even walk out while they pumps.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to light up breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in an entertaining and easily recognisable way what incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a camp near the border of Texas
The number of deprived migrants has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month has remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that vicious rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump Government have made it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most of the reference people themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and fear to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, witnessed before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for reference to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since then.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's matters more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be brought into court within a month of being deprived of liberty, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to the staff at the premises.
Many of them are present on a video link rather than on a personal basis in order to bring their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those not deemed to have the right to protection are quickly deported.
The longer children are deprived of freedom, the more likely they are to be affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the camps and reports from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concerns are rising at major facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent town without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and say good - bye to friends, the traumas that many are already struggling with can worsen.
Syria requires American, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Damascus government would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily educating and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - torn country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "proliferating irrational fear" which enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel mount Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "transmission of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency was brought to an early conclusion by national law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there is no sign that viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the ratings at the best viewing time have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. The MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers under big news evenings.
"This is like a fire to which people are drawn, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a long-time comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," says Nell Scovell to me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly been sitting and looking for six hours at an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich for $15,000 ("a garment filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and meaning in Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trump's, hm, anatomy.
I myself will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Some of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (Talk argument with NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single episode, you'll fall behind.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on the northern Kaai in Hawaii, but he sat and owled indoors and watched MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not break down, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be confronted with the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said: 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a congress district that two members have now competed in the same place.
This recently redesigned suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb is campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were constitutionally altered to the advantage of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has resulted in a campaign financing dispute between the major economic sections of the parties, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a broad-guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional district.
That place had been held by a republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats some impetus.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the participants recruited Trump's leadership team.
Officials in the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the American missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "newss made decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said the department spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated 140 million dollars in US aid in 2017, and the money would go to drug control and development, among other things, and provide financial support.
The sanctions proposed, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
However, in mid-September senior officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped reflections on sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now be speaking at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, as described by the three American officials, two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Studying the Story
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged legal abuse, for which there is now considerable evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct his investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the American election.
If Congress were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just when he prepares to once again stand up in the elections, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, so neither his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how far-reaching the fight can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had opposed him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbaths that followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and democracy's relentless advance is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he should have proposed to record the president secretly last year and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not true.
"How shall we answer whether the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections for a Congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to light Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the rooster.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal that ended unexpectedly earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
A knelt prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-game against Villarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone for greater success.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says 31-year-old.
"We entered the game in the belief that we could get something, and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten it in at the end, but in general it was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half.
Now on Thursday, there will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but there will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can probably pull out and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly because of the fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the country - wide study said that they had talked to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to give you care if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a major impact on the costs.
Take the help of your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a life insurance hybrid with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with own resources, if you can afford it.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal battles from the outset.
Establish a health officer, so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks after your medical care and ensure that the health care staff follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a proxy for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What drugs are they?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan's ready."
Shot several times with air guns in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with air guns when he walked home from a night out.
The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life threatening, and the police call on witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It states officials. The death rate is expected to rise.
Communications are excluded, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala management area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the earthquake epicentre. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main town in the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is situated in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area that stretches along more than 300 km of the northwest coast of Sulawesis.
In 2017, the administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had a population estimated at 299 200 people.
The supporters in the province of Centrala Sulawesis' economy are fisheries and agriculture, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, the West of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circular seismic ether, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province of Indonesia on northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami affecting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along Indian Ocean coasts. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with the magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck across the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with the magnitude 7.6 hit close to the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A fundamental earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and the tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palins' eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, aged 29 and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for committing a complaint of domestic violence and for opposing arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska’s state police.
According to the police report, he must have picked up the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in the Mat-Su custody and is held against the $500 bail warrant to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the bail, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteeed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of less serious class A crimes, which means that he can have up to one year in prison and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious Class B crime, which is punished with one day in prison and 2,000 dollars in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of having committed a complaint of domestic violence and of possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behaviour with post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the centre of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit the scene are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim the rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a rental car from the construction and furnishing chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a cycle path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He took down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the declaration of intent on the death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can be a death sentence, according to the court order.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "concealing planning and intent," said the prosecutors, and described the same way that Saipov carried it out as "abominable, cruel and inhuman".
Sayvollo Habiblaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the bill of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The southern district of New York has not been charged with a case where it is charged with the death penalty in a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple of Rosenberg were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret during the days and months that followed the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be placed in his hospital room, and the police gave up.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "givenly disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to agree to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant admits guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Mr Tories said that NIGL FARAGE should be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a protest at the Torie conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the heat" from the Europeans, when one of Theresa May's own MPs proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that Britain would already "have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge facing Theresa May in making the deeply divided supporters reconciled has been exacerbated by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers agreement, alive during attacks by Brexitists, those who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setbacks, and force EU sceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organised by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola the Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the helm, we would have been out by now," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough District of Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to flush the Chequers agreement".
He made clear his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjective.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit Pendant Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and talked to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'The Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and with our electoral workers who are on the streets and make sure we are elected.
Put away the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Prime ministers will keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they failed to take the decision that was taken with the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not gonna let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis from the House of Lords mocked the conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"These are the people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a clean father's.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning a "real thinker" to run to the Presidential post.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take on an "ordinary thinker of running to the Presidential post" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now stands for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might be approaching Donald Trump by 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump's arrival.
One person asked her if she was planning to run to the Presidential post.
Warren replied it's time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on top."
One person arrested for killing the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of LSU bass player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of shooting on Friday to get help identifying a man who appears on the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University's campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died of this," said Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been in the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to custody at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starting last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Champion's title after team orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on the dryer when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first in the ditch and let Hamilton drive in at the back of the bell, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton progressed after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of biding in place after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and was seven at the end of the first lap on his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tires to reach a quick finish and drive around the Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the 44th shipyard depot but failed to speed up during the remaining eight shipyards when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, for she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony of Ford to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the last few days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty, and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Wait a minute.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's accusations, I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to The Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her resolution does not seem to have fit the president, who commented on it this way during the Saturday evening's meeting: "I'm going to tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she hasn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate of the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all necessary means.
They see their meanness and greed, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control," said the president, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-target lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard confirmed to Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two teams, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on the assist from Kendall McFaulll, and David Rutherford assisted when Beauvillier doubled the line four minutes later.
In the first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who signed at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again receipted a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the winnings with his team's fifth half way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of their last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could escape from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he died making sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the river in the city of Palu.
However, even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gäferan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild floating control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would come down.
He died later in the hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are crushed by hearing this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the death rate may rise to over a thousand people. The country’s emergency aid agency says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in assistance and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance with dead bodies comes.
There's little clean water.
Minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we do not know what they will be met by there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now announces that a man is missing after an aircraft crash into a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plan that fell into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were in safety.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when it tried to land at the airport of the Chuukoes.
Officials reported on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was passing the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew in very low.
"That's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through mid - deep water to the emergency corridors on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin crew panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor shock.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people on land before the plane sank in the 30 - meter - deep water.
Aviation Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed its plea in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as experts in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone records to puzzle the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims, reported the newsmagazine The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers’ cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he's lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis erased Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final appointment on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hip hops have come far away from their origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently gained a boost in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A baby girl in New York matches a couple because of termination after a "racial" text message
A baby girl in New York is facing a couple of discriminating dismissals after she received a misreaded text message from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the mood with "expression".
Two-child mom Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN'T A SAVE IGEN", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "like to have a heart," and gave Maurice the kick, and claimed that their former African-American baby girl had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she matches the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She asks for the amount of $350 per day for the job she was employed from the beginning to do, which would be for six months and where she would stay with the couple. However, she did not have a contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to the New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple waived the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only straight thing was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone whom you had been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "expressing" and said that his wife would feed children two months later and were in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you supposed to give yourself to such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticised them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington publishers did not think that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny, considering what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children’s book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was “bitterly light” after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud of her final success.
"He was pretty quiet off, and not a boastful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds with something. You get proud of the child even if it is not you who have done it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he used to give Paddington his own glory."
My daughter was going to die, and I got to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"They called regularly to say it was really bad, and they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said that she would die within two minutes and that I must say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The drugs the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not moan or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and my tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women setting up postcards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost closeness because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells me that her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile was shining up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his sibling after he had killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I keep worrying about the consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't shut up, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas gifts, he didn't have eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It rips up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches investigation.
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps get some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "split" due to deeply rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their stubbornness depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his decision in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean droplets "sunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping off to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the South Korean Ministry of Reconciliation, says that 1,127 people jumped last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher charges for human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, the vast majority of those who are losing their lives from North Korea are offering South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans will have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the victors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is still at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks with a focus on negotiated nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean peninsula to be freed from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we certainly cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of victimizing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and occasionally he almost cried out when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats of the Committee, saying that the accusations against him were a "gross and coordinated murder of character" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was partial to the disadvantages of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to court if he was elected, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell Congress or FBI the truth, then he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Health Insurance Act Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory inquiries, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would amend certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the situation for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a just criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she became angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she said to the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted to cause anger in part because they are often misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar of an older woman. It was a chilly boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see that you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and happy that they were able to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital deal on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of setting up himself in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late, she lay behind with the money collection, promising not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice stuttered.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schröder on the press's reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my tombstone?"
"She cried?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening star of the trade war between the US and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the crack between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by occupying important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most important escalation came this week, with new customs duties on goods for USD 200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods entering the USA from China are customs duty-bound.
Every time Beijing replied with the same coin, it was recently dropped on charges of between five and ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US action. The world’s second largest economy will probably not step down in time.
Getting Washington back means bending for demands, but publicly crawling for the United States would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Experts believe, however, that if Beijing plays its short law, the US trade war press can provide positive support for China in the long term, by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"A fast political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to recognise," said Abigail Grace, research assistant with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "redo" for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and appeals for help to build the country, which is devastated after the war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe went off with the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the end of the 16th hole's 3-course, and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who has ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranked players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking players, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, which may have made their last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said one touched Garcia after the victory of the European law.
He left over the staff pin to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend by finding fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after the depressing performance of the team: "I am proud of these guys, they have fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You get to bow and beak.
They played better than we did."
Algflowering: The levels decline in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in the concentrations of algal flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven flowers are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate decreased levels.
The algflower stretches along about 20 miles [20 km] of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile into the sea outside the big municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algblooming has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Middle-high concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium-high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports on respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida during the past week.
