Food debt to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the price increase was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been expected of only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the latter. According to its discretion, the reduction in interest rates would favour the rise in commodity prices and the slight fall in unemployment as a result of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is committed to keeping the inflation rate below two percent, or at least short on the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the Zwickmühle: inflation must be "agreed" in order to exclude later action needs.
At 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area were the rise in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat listings rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also cost significantly in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to decrease to 1.9 percent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts expect a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Localised Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the support for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented peak of 13 percent.
With the party-faithing voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: more than two thirds (71 percent) are opposed to one fifth (20 percent) of consent for the MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entry guard: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before was the share of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "very bad", so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth is due to improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "rare than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great trust or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of political moods is the number of those who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be tackled even without change of government.
If there were still 35% of the government's and the head of government's stay after the turmoil last October, this proportion is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty", and another 20% would give their vote "probably".
By way of comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "safely" to the urns, and another 15% consider their participation "probable". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
The share of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would be 81, 84 and 89 percent in the group of participants in the referendum.
Akaan most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading area have maintained this year's average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded.
After last December's prices in the food markets have been "davongalopulated", the price has not been drastically higher than the already high, earlier level of output.
However, it is certainly alarming to consumers that what they paid well below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Unicum and live fish prices remained almost on the previous year's level, while prices for Putenbrustfilets, nuss and mohn have increased sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but for Echan there were 1kg breadweeks for 139 forint.
The product did not have a competitive price fall of less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two liter Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink including pan was only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year cut off in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison also the most expensive, and Cora the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has raised the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Achaan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest basket of the previous year and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year, however, the increase in VAT during the last Christmas prices became noticeable.
This very process has hit trade badly: it seems that the department stores were not able to decide which price range to apply in the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the dealer is planning the speed of circulation of a product badly, it may fall for substantial profits in the price range according to the transport intensity.)
The price of the "Napi" basket fell so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed as the most expensive basket cost more by 1.630,00 Forint than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic price increase, the price of the daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office established over a period of 12 months more than 30 per cent of the cost.
So in about next to flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has risen by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Apparently, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they were able to turn the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; good years are constantly reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets across the shop tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes at the cash box in all three department stores, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only on food but also on sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not directly relevant to the control of the infections, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured one of a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation has not been performed since because of the bacterium that is still in the patient’s body.
By 10 December of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomials Surveillance System, according to the chief physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark rate is likely to be higher.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacilline.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about a third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as inflammation of the throat, inflammation of the almonds, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the drugs are used too high or improperly, antibiotic resistant from the well-responsive bacteria, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poor immune system functioning, but also in elderly, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of Jáno's hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital's everyday life.
If the infection is not to be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA told us there is no place where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistance
"Such patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - according to Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are examined on MRSA, an infection cannot be avoided at all.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable to curbing the development or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospital staff should examine the patients who have received it and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not practised so often in the Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the state sickness fund.
Thus, most cases would not come to daylight until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
The European Union has strongly recommended the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapies are supposed to be targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations are necessary in order to avoid resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
According to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological samples were even more rare among patients in the ambulatory, or in the primary care.
Saving in disinfectants
Scientific evidence proves that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other by the nurse most frequently.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often overcrowded, the beds stretched close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz continues to point out, in the less well funded hospitals, even the fact that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that directly favour the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less frequent, or may be stopped the further spread of the pathogen, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections under control causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA and its containment were recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the tendency of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA), as well as prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
Killer police chief was not drunk
In the case of a car accident with a fatal outcome caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident was neither alcoholized nor drug-influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the official report was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief, with his own car in the XXII district, entered Kossuth Lajos Street and passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(Laut StVO, however, is not a milder circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, inferiority .)
The pedestrian has been injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then returned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The loan agreement over EUR 100 million has already been signed earlier, the current agreement deals with the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The sum agreed in the loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also intended to be used to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the framework of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of over EUR 50 million, which will mainly be part of research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
During the meeting the metro line 4 also came to speak.
It was agreed that once Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The interest rates are EURIBOR, the loan is provided by the EIB at a delay of 8 years, without any commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - Europe as a whole looks closely at the previously rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the EU's cheapest market, which is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is no doubt the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in Eastern European countries, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular.Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly in demand.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country is also attracting investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favorable area of Russians records more buyers.
The capital Sofia offers also tempting offers - commercial and office areas offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons as well as in the other two seasons.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in a large style, for example, around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized properties by 50-100,000 euros, or fallen houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they then renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is business people who invest with the aim of a medium to long-term value increase.
However, real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-increasing demand.
While real estate prices are lowest within the EU in Bulgaria, over the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 percent per year.
The cost of real estate prices is far higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the Six Hungarian Percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali Roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the post-2012 period, that is, after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
At present, a heated debate is underway between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrialised countries are prepared to support developing countries financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on support for developing countries.
The Adaptation Fund set out in the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected at the UN Global Environmental Facility (GFF), as read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
Environment Minister Gábor Fodor, in the name of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured at 1990 levels), regardless of whether the "Agreement after 2012" will be successful or not. The Union would even be prepared to use itself for a 30 percent reduction, provided that other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to fulfil their commitments in a strong and responsible manner.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a decrease of 8% with its then 15 member states.
The requirement for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will be able to meet, as is stated in the Environmental Ministry's press release.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction project would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which has also been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report, with the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British army throws on YouTube
Units of the British army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos to the network against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The photographs shot with miniature cameras mounted on helmets are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already assisted 139 such recordings, their "channel" was considered more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defencehead quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the Luftwaffe has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign missions.
Propaganda, published in this way, is almost free of charge compared to traditional television advertising, says defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain amount of political message in them, as they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
America’s Recruit With Game
But the army must also fight against amateur shots, which in addition to the carefully processed, censored recordings also make it into the net - such as those that show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are highest talked about, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have already been loaded onto the platform in use, but this "gatting" has only recently been discovered by the British.
The Americans, however, advertise something different, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Mikonika Lamperth is by no means sensitive: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a work conference where her employees can end up with coffee and pogatsche in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or shocks in the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held today at the Defense Center, but the Ministry's staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Way Night Party of the orphans" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Festival" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad are hosted, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFC) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, and about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFC) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The room rental amounted to 1 million forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFA is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the conditions.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFA, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities were opened with a speech by the minister, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] one announced: There was no ball-dressing or suiting obligation.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government prepare each for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for around 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Mikonika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to a conference on the sound of the year.
It is estimated that about 180 guests - according to the press department - will only be hosted with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 forint.
The self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will simply start with his colleagues in the Ministry's Aula.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas party in its own hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditures were measured with 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent impact.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term, PM employees celebrate this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas celebration is due this time.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the town park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured by 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions that are held each year are traditionally beginning with a brief speech by the minister and sound with a restrained twilight.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the Press Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the ceremony held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Federation of Trade Unions will form their coordinating committee on Friday for the indefinite duration of the strike beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the Health Insurance Act - the work will begin.
It is expected that strike-related, significant traffic barriers will occur as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and Budapest's public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 13.00.
Details of the strike on Monday are shared on Friday afternoon by the League Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, there will be a protesting big meeting, and from Monday all the organisations that have joined the strike will settle the work for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees meet to discuss further action.
On the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not be possible until the later evening hours, or even at midnight, to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike that starts on Monday will mean that there will have to be considerable traffic barriers: the railways are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time; in the morning, most of the public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are stopped.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places one way.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is continuously updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others were planning a temporary reduction of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement was reached between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways of the VDSZZ, although more and more people are on the train at Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, from work start to 13.00 hrs at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 hrs, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy put down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union, e.g. the Democratic Teachers' Association, have called for 2 or 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Medical Association operates at different times across the country, with the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points requested by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
The third claim is that the eligible professional groups will already be able to access the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZ of the League of Trade Unions did not accept the supply of the ancillary lines submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increases State risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guards founded this August with the support of the "movement for a better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
Among other things, the Institute's "risk warning report" states: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guards, the highest political risk is the "distorting of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocation of such an argument, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on Roma-Hungary counterparts".
It is believed that this would aggravate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "has seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially in terms of confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right-wing groups in Hungary has been constantly on the rise, so that since summer 2007, several "national self-defense associations" have been formed.
"These groups mean that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly bragging to prepare their members for - including armed - defence tasks (catastrophy, national defence, order-keeping), calling for the inappropriateness of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further, this is all done in accordance with that method, which tries to embrace different political and political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative based on the political and party demise of the population.
The emphasis of the civil character and the form of association thus serve not only the circumvention of legal hurdles that might arise in the course of registration in court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Guard constitute a risk-enhancing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring states, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the establishment of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has increased.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guards are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guards, whose foundation was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard, there were the Roma masquerades that took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU took the incidents as the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization of "national protection" was.
In the past 17 years, she felt that a genuine "terrorism of Gypsies" in Bulgaria had been felt, but the state remained indifferent and inactive - according to the Political Capital.
And further, the initiative would have started a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they should set up their own guard for resistance purposes.
As the activities of the Hungarian Guards have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma too, with the organisation of their own protection, react to the threats, it is stated in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital said on request from the news office: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changing trends should be evident, public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year will bring us less such days.
Also in the EU and America, something else is understood as "Holiday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and days free of work.
Unemployed days are mostly church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year, are work-free days - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
All year long we have fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15th, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and October 23rd, the commemoration of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state, on May 1st, we celebrate the work, on November 1st and 2nd, we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proved itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of extended weekends, however, is that we have to work on Saturdays before very well, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally due to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for many years been defined in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and civil servants.
Except for companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on the holidays.
Today, the working order is only confused by the celebrations at the end of the year: From December 24 the life in this country remains formal, since most days between Christmas and New Year's Eve take time equalisation, or the special holiday for them.
Next year, more holidays fall to the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer changes on working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed "on the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second re-disposition is related to the holiday on October 23rd: On Saturday, October 18th, one will have to finish Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be left to rest in the sign of the holidays, after the 24th of December all lies and remains, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six deterrent minorities to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" to everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, knowingly for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, one regrets it and tries to make it up to it again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and arguing that one would have forgotten to correct the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, there's an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should consider how to make unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more nervous than when you grab a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly angered if they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office put in the bag, because it could hit one yourself: no more, if you need it urgently.
Do you advise on the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective way of stopping a trachea that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's done?
Where and why?
One should not tie the information (or guesses) about colleagues' private life to everyone's nose, as far as possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his inner secret, we should not misuse that trust!
It is best to keep quiet like a grave instead of directing those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported ill for no reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself on painful headaches, because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, indispensable work, projects with fixed dates now have to be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you won't be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could get in between, why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Summary, Geeks, Telephone
One is just in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud geeks of the ladies?
Needless to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard better?
You shouldn't let your colleagues talk with buzzing, singing, loud conversation (which you take across your heads), humming, constantly spitting, or narrowing.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important news, you should not look for the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
As far as possible, one should not speak out on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one is to admit his mistakes, and if others were affected, apologize!
The question of how to make up for the mistake, or how to make up for the failure, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleep: Comfortable for home, but in the office nothing has lost!
Not even then should you dress so lightly if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress properly in the office - if you wish, also nice and elegant!
It all wants to be right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning stow.
From the radio sounds a strange melody: the sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's Zagar's "Wings of Love" song that sounds like mr2.
The local music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the staunch differently when you hear the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall picture, and even if the Garagenrock with its guitar guitar guitar guitar guitar is "in", the native Electropop proves: There is new stuff under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, musiced himself in the band Yunderboi before he began to walk his own way - perhaps because a host house did not tolerate two pipes.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only able to come to him with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török.
The formation, which had initially appeared in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ran its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was almost the only trendsetter in the West.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it didn't interest anyone if they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new paths to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time Baláz's Zságer was on his way with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be fine, but besides the ethereal character of music, the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll, appear - the contemporary spirit and the trends corresponding to it.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio beater - the Mr2 Petőfi, which has been sending from early to late pop music, has succesively placed the earworm with the number "Wings of Love", which has been recorded with the help of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right.
The hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "Schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sick and unspeakable, but they can only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also arise from an honest motive.
The responsiveness of the listener also works in accordance with this principle, of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: Internationally, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more attentively because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it's a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music does not come about to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly felt at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there are only in the unmistakable changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing has occurred to me: If you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yunderboi?
He is on the move as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, sometimes apart from always trying to interpret this in our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players, who rely on the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
In the beginning, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as a final of the album, with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six female singers?
Why her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of putting together the choir from talented soloists of the local music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh -, which we then baptised later "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song the same way, or did you make it with the girls?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still needs something.
The chord sequence formally demanded a singing voice.
I sang the melody the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came practically on end and alarmingly spontaneous.
I remember, I was pretty electrified back then, but it took the divas.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: On the record as well as at the concert one had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own role, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They were also on stage at the back.
Is it intention?
B.Z.: That they were standing in the back was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we didn't want to let them have solo rolls.
The number is also about forgetting your ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where is going, let's just let these particular wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I would like others to feel this euphorical state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In musical work, there is no one at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything joined together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts continuously and also now, where I have released the album.
Currently there are "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Swindlers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless scammer
His former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came almost five billion euros on its account.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it right away, certainly not incapable of doing so.
Unlike all large banking houses, he recognized the crisis in time in the American mortgage market.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
But as Kerviel's statements, published by the French media, for example the daily Le Monde, show, he was a person who had gained 1.6 billion euros in his business last year.
Crisis Not Just in America
"Everything I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros at the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was that so-called sub-prime hypothecites, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payback problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that you can't get him to the hustle.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even if the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
Hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about 51000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90000 dollars.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"During my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros at the London bombings on the price losses of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"That's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses allegedly knew about everything, or suspected it.
"As long as I made money, you closed your eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to make it right.
When he got to work on Monday, he was no longer a bank employee.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros on its behalf.
And how did they get to him?
He made himself suspect through a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to see him in the cards," said Kermiel in conclusion.
The Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes through which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funding for innovative businesses.
Companies are therefore to win finance for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the current EU funds investment, the Czech Republic is among the new accession countries among the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan court confirms 20 years of imprisonment for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, whom he had been sentenced to 100 million dollars in 2003 for financial fraud (up to 1.8 billion dollars).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to Ileana Pérez, the chairman of the appeal court, it will now be up to the detainees to decide whether or not to allow Alemán to take his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court pointed out four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Finally, some of these funds ended up in a fund set up by Alemán for the financing of his 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to refuse him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally poorly respected, yet highly significant law in every peace.
That is a certain paradox.
All government starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober numbers.
The state budgets suffered from three weaknesses among the past social-democratic governments, which the 2008 budget cannot at once eliminate:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure which is mandatory by law, not only in the case of pensions but also in the case of social expenditure which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the municipal budget deficits.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and partially under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipal budget deficit.
Many mayors, in addition to income from taxes, taxes and bank loans, issued other sources of investment, often unconsidered debt securities, which they oversold their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks received from the state as a result of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
So far as we only stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been growing for a number of years, like the rest of the world, whose ČSSD boasts without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have worked much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a great shame attributed mainly to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened with poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which have, unfortunately, been superfluously blown up to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if some of the absurd populist expenditures adopted this year before the elections have been deleted, it is clear that if next year there will not be a shift in the age of retirement and a pension reform, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to him but pure administrator.
It is only easy to exaggerate when it is said that ruling politicians will become officials, who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The 2008 deficit of 70 billion would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not spent what was going on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it really to be the result of becoming purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but it is aware that the state can spend only as much as it can on taxes and fees to be able to wish for rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these will allow gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to deal with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
For example, more than 100 billion dollars will be made available to auctions on the currency markets.
At these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, and another 24 makes it easier for the European and Swiss Central Banks.
It is the first time, after the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumoohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost about 60 billion dollars due to unutilised loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions to lose.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still be done when they decided to do so," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, they will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used for lending between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, even though the U.S., Canada and UK central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks is contributing to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Debates of the Ecologists Are Unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which constitutes a strange mix of government representatives and such by non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word-fired work, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in his book that his subject was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet with cartoons of my views."
Now the prospective could read out their attitude undisputedly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climatelogist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, able to understand and assess technical treatises, has experience with statistics, and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are thus normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore pose no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems, he considers it unacceptable to impose other unproved views, he sees this as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
On questions of those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who take no account of the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people failed to exchange their license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will enter the road without valid driving authorisation.
According to the authorities, in particular, those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving licence.
While small towns report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of visas, the offices of the capital are overburdened with requests, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration runs around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
Around 140000 drivers in Prague have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition a new driver's license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not create the required conversion until the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's license are threatened with a fine from January onwards.
The culprit pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
The police can, however, also use it with a reminder when committing a crime.
In the event of a breach, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the one from the community can also get a punishment imposed, which is not going at all.
He could, so it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry already called on the offices to allow gentleness and to impose at most a penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crowns penalty.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a personal identity card that everyone must have, namely a valid one.
People who don't want to drive should give up their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by registration.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid at the end of the year.
However, drivers will gradually have to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having joined the gangs of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years imprisonment.
This was decided in a jurisprudence judgment by the Prague Supreme Court, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, 14 or 12 years of age were threatened by the detectives of the "Amte für den Kampfung den gest gest gestleben" (Amte für die gestlegende gestleben gestlegen die Versetzung gestleben).
There is no appeal against today's judgment, only revision to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged with this matter, but he is at first faced with the preliminary ruling.
In other processes, however, he had already received punishments of a total of 16 years.
That's all he can do is condemn him.
In January 19 people were accused of engaging in robbery, and today the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants disputed the charges from the outset with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with, among other things, Berdych criminals gave information from sources of the police, covered various robberys and helped members of the gang to escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The charge concerns crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, about robberys, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also because of official claims and illicit possession of weapons.
In house searches, the police discovered illegal guns, steel core ammunition, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the gang, the charge has increased by many millions of crowns as a result of their robbery.
In addition to almost 20 men in this proceeding, courts recognized Berdych and a number of others because of further robberys legally strong than guilty.
Other men from Berdych's district have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and are waiting for the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic, have thus far escaped.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč wants 12 million crowns compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million each, for the fathers two million each, and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore in favour of the proposal Velebas.
"We reject such a proposal because it is too high a lot," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"But in order to be able to express an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite made.
We'll find out if it's worth saying.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands for all together," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, a report was used as the basis for reparation negotiations, which he received from the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
In the opinion of professionals in the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in varying degrees and depth.
The men carried the stress situation better, even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, cope with the consequences of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba summarized the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses incurred by Třebíč hospital error under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the event of doubt, they will have to resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional circumstances can they apply for assistance from the sponsor.
So far, the courts have pledged relatively low amounts of compensation to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polivka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walach king", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor for many years.
Polivka did not take part in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is probably not over and his client will probably file a appeal.
"The issue of the dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," said Polívkas lawyer after the trial.
Everyone was introduced to this actor and comedian in the words "Walachish Kingdom".
The same opinion is also shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is dispute for money.
"After years they noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to win our work in a parasitic way," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walach king" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that did not coincide with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom at that time.
A few years later, Harabiš thought about spending Welsh passports.
From an initially fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized out, to which Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also pointed out today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the broadcast "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívka has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team were dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's divided parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to be settled between Polívka and Harabiš, who, in the resignation of "King Boleslavs I, were elected to Saint-Nimmerlein's Day".
The lead role then took place as Queen Mother at the suggestion of Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
Details and an appointment he didn't want to tell.
"We don't want to overwhelm anything.
It was supposed to be something like the king's move in the Walachei.
The king was to be chosen for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of the gear circuit, steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and that's a lot better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit more, and I just want to revise my opinion.
For example, when I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the lack of head freedom on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the body of the combi is designed in such a way that even two-meter men will not suffer.
Quick Forward
I'm just going through the interior to make sure I don't repeat too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the caring middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The page content has also improved considerably compared to 206.
With regard to the range of rooms, you can also feel the larger dimensions of the body.
In the combi, the already mentioned lack of head freedom is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the loading room.
I have to describe it (also because of the foldable rear window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, let themselves be pulled apart and also hold harder objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
It is according to the table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when a stroller is invited.
But in order to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the flat loading space or the very low charging edge after the folding of the seat-back.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a engine capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatback should look like this.
He's quiet, has low consumption and pulls out well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be clogged with a rag, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410,900 crowns, which is quite a lot already.
The features Premium of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electric window lifts and...
This is how the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you can count on the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which brand you want to choose.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not possible.
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, causing local fears for the further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants gradually increase.
Disputes, harassment and robbery among students have transferred to parent relations.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended themselves by the boy’s insulting them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minors.
The girls had reportedly made racist remarks to the man and cast stones on him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed a bushouse and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he hired us with apples and pears and then unearthed his buttocks," one Slovak mother of The Times newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming ever more tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks came here for work.
Some 30000 Slovak students therefore attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you select only the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters that offer on the beach pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this to an extensive extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniard Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever to see a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
Built it was one of the bosses of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) was gladly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, across the wide boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought himself an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht lie.
On the walls of the Bodeuita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of Havana's Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the Nacional bar you can mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana to this day because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long fallen apart in the salty and wet air.
May Havana, especially its oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere can you find in the vicinity as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are being drained right now, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much needed money, there was green light for this development.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marrot, which is unique in the world and attracts railway lovers in particular.
The sugar cane of remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-operated narrow-track railways to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how we see clean and fully functioning locomotives, whose old friends have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion objectives
The most important places do not leave the majority of visitors to Cuba.
You don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Keep in mind that in Hemingway's previously mentioned estate there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by anyone who likes this writer.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The lush vegetation grows on lime floor.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, climbed steeply from the valley floor, in their cavities collected fertile soil, through which also weathered rocky areas are covered with dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was still no road in the 1950s that the area would have connected with the other country.
This isolation contributed to the lack of attention.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing ripped off, everyone was glad he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "number of sugar factories".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not fade until the morning.
Baracoa
This town in eastern Cuba is some of the most beautiful of the island.
Certainly this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo must overcome high and rugged mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern suburb of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled nature, included UNESCO in its World Heritage List.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church you show the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present Hotel El Castillo, stands, are seen several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the best known.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, over all this one could write many pages.
But, as one says, better look with one's own eyes.
Allys in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment have influenced the United States of America in the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years, according to the words of defense minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not run according to its ideas, about which the Scottish Edinburgh agreed the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defense minister Robert Gates, called NATO units for more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable residents to start their own business and security development," says British Minister of Defense Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years, according to the American army.
The number of violence operations rose by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way in which we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the General Secretary of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I am not pleased with what we have at our disposal in Afghanistan to land and air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the agency Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there has also been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
Germany, for example, was criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the battle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
This week, the British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers foulpelze.
"Afghanian nonstudent disillusions: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a post that was complemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German photomagazine went to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech Republic has a debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion kronor by the end of September.
The government had planned this year to indebted with 159.2 billion women.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budget policy.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic’s debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the sovereign debt from early October.
Each Czech has a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was indebted to more than 111 billion crowns.
"Up until now, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be crossing the border from a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, Patria Finance analyst, server iHNed.cz.
Similarly Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: "To exceed a Bill, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage is to change, and politicians should be ready to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he remarked.
Growing Debt
The debt is caused by the debt of the government and comes mainly from the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by tax instructions, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The government's foreign debt has now risen by 1.7 billion dollars to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and dropped by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of sovereign debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that growth is mainly in the case of debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand this shows that something can be done before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the 2007 government debt management show that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of government budget policy.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns rather than the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kronor, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the loan rates for the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was presented today to a court in Khartoum.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been charged in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening and subsequently sentenced to 15 days.
The British were accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give the name of Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any depiction of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be beaten up.
After parents of students complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary schoolteacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher calls on her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class enteddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports head of school Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, choose 20 of 23 children Muhammad as favorite first names.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself did not carry a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbon's Muslim colleagues who taught at the same school in Sudan explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything to draw her into a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is just an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many teachers who describe them as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks in class about religion.
It should be borne in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given name in the UK, for which 14 different spellings exist in English.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (it is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it a toy, for example?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
At the end of failure
On Wednesday morning, the Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status, explained the European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizeing that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called on them to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of conciliation procedure on 10 December
The Troika agents, which unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer when Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botswana-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating meeting since the Troika had received a new mandate from the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing the negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains advocates of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botswana-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of Kosovo being under the administration of the UN, Western countries are looking after EU independence for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce these unilaterally if the Security Council is not to decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached , the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations.
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, believed that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that has been so weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken alone in the Security Council, where their Russian allies have a veto right.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the final word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, declared Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Mr Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanian speaking population would expire in consultation with the Western countries.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference, which was held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a peace treaty by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop its colonisation work, Bush stated, recalling the two parties' commitments with regard to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, under Abbas , ultimately seek a peace treaty that will resolve all open questions without exception , and including the central issues .
This term includes the three serious problems which are mainly affecting the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homeland, which is in the present state of Israel, in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the president of the United States, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide for a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook to conduct the forthcoming cease-fire negotiations directly and without interruption and to try to put an end to them by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli side by side , for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that Bush has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries into the paths of peace offered to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a pathway in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince, in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are confronted.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car on Rue Louise-Michel headed Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m.
He had no use, but was on a stripe, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without bluelight, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, thus not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without a helmet, at very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had failed to pass from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out on vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (precipitated wing, split windshield, torn stubble) shows the tenacity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Girry announced that she entrusted the IGPN with an IGPN report on the "facts of involuntary personal murder and lack of assistance to persons in danger", in coordination with the main guidance for the public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excluded the IGPN from the police's responsibility at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-power wheel has reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of railing, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained interlocked until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were autographed yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumour quickly made the round, according to which the police had left the place of the accident very quickly, and that without providing assistance to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also rule out any serious error in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and in which one must take very careful action.
Liberation has hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who hung.
Two more tried to revive one of the young people who telephoned the fourth.
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the incident and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the persons present had of the unexpected situation of the young, the policemen who had arrived at the accident site were taken into the car.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces did not help young people.
First aid has been provided to these young people.
The fire brigade has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, for her part the prosecutor emphasized.
In Pakistan the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police have put down the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had been proclaimed by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, some 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the context of the emergency had been injured by the tear gas grenades that the forces of the order used there.
Then they threw stones to hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court's attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition leaders, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Other demonstrations had been held in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the attorneys' movement received the support of religious parties united in the powerful alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president asked the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced Saturday evening.
He had to refer, in the days following, to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a directly elected position on 6 October.
The President of the Court, iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the upper command over the army and to become a civilian president no longer applies since the call of the emergency, stated on Monday the Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform until November 15th, the date on which his first term of office would end as president.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
Furthermore, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumours in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
More than a third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Wirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
At any rate, eight out of ten births are carefully planned these days.
With one out of five couples even calculated exactly to the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work on the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, has achieved the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools brushed by the astronauts to carry out the repair several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the space ferry Discovery, a large cylindrical part, which will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17.5-tonne heavy power generation module over solar collectors, which was already on the ISS, in order to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew began restructuring the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be unfolded like accordion, was damaged by a clamped cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts who originally left for a control course the space ferry Discovery and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle that had been attached to the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was thus selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rail on the damaged spot.
It was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, by inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with insulator to prevent an electric impact on the solar panels that generate several hundred volts, had invented and brushed the astronauts aboard the station.
When the action was completed, Scott waited until the collector was fully folded before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space ferry Discovery to expect to return to Earth on Wednesday.
Title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion in order to counter the A400M's residues, EADS is currently showing a significant drop in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to re-examine its business forecasts for 2007, referring to the residues of the A400M engine caused by the slow development of the aircraft, which delay the aircraft's maiden flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion , of which more than one billion for Airbus , announced the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS .
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in presenting its quarterly results for 2007, without further detail.
The Group also notes that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the EADS business performance fell from 86% in 2006, largely due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to tell the urns: the masses of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her quest for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, when the President received the foreign ambassadors, he had nothing to understand and was content to deliver a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference - his favourite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone there.
She is barraging a campaign of blackmail.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-chast World Champion Garry Kasparovder had been sentenced to five days imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrators, according to his lawyer continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus
After these parliamentary elections, two very further questions arise:
Who will take up Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of Parliament and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, the government and president will choose?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovietus, they are not master of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, Director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes further: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized after Europe for five centuries; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again linked to the model of a paternalistic state, which was totally adopted by the population, the more since this new paternalism followed no terror, but rather a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today , the Russians abandon the personal responsibility they have put on short notice after the collapse of the USSR .
What's the point?
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands how to hold the Status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the United Russia's local electoral lists.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What's the point?
Those who are in power aren't so bad, why replace them?
A heavy reminder
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen at a total length of 27 km, have not been available until now, except with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and named, i.e. on the question of a former victim or his family members.
In May 2006, the eleven States entrusted with their administration - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Clues Down
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the state of health of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of this archive, which is managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The prisoners' lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been assembled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and to provide them with any evidence of their arrest, so as to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent tens of thousands of personal inquiries are still being handled in Bad Arolsen.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing fundamentally new in these documents, said Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe is already reaching EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing Free Trade Agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will significantly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the 10 most frequently exported products by India, the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange goods worth 47 billion euros each year and services worth 10 billion euros, this week Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's New Delhi Ordinance, explained, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet for their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers £10 billion for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed itself concerned about curbing the current alarm about credit terms and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly tough at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December , in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it states in a communication .
The Bank further explains that on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT, 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be circulated, to the basic tax rate and only to 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE is bringing liquidity into circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the daily different interest rates of the interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
From day to day the interbank interest rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been at 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts of the Bank of England have been linked to fines that the banks had prevented from using.
According to some rumours, reinforced by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums circulated by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which corresponds to a rejection of the text.
The text of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the PS National Committee, of which the majority of which 50% were for the employment allowance, for the reintroduction of the TIP fleet, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which gave rise to partial violent exchanges of words between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's contribution to the purchase power.
The leader of PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative proposal for the correction of the finances that had been examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, has served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones announced from C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 will host the Lullapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will take place from 8-10 August on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the United Kingdom Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in the Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production as co-owners, in order to include the licenses and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been there, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work in parallel together to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Unfortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents brought the Lullapalooza festival back to life in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago, after it was profiled together with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival in 2002.
The two events have been able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax allowances in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on the urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts in one way or another in order to convey the impression of a rural festival to the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about half way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Vineland's community, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to give up the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award of the last Ballboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal, if no less than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock tests are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "heikle Mandat" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Gouvernator?
"You have to be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who think they are the best," he says.
The run at the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the current priority is to introduce the cinema there.
The pursuit of the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented in January at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange a final-year rally ahead? Disunity among experts due to the U.S. mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year on the stock exchange, investors are already rubbing their hands with regard to the coming end-year Rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make any safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically speaking, the month of December on the stock exchange usually goes along with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially if tensions are serious, the current market situation is not determined.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong increase in prices in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant, which are mainly affected by the lack of secure equity funds in pension funds, which are heavily affected by the value-added trend to yieldable assets.
Consequently, these experts believe that the stock exchange will rather have a lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the magnitudes of the possible decrease in the interest rate of the US notes bank, a uncertainty which is mainly due to the rise in the crude oil price and the risk of the rise in the inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully end the year with almost 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasises that this year things could develop a little differently; mainly because of the final-year rally taking place already in the second week of December, and therefore directly after the day of the bridge to the date of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values which depended on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis in the near future.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values to drive the Ibex to new peaks, the analysts agree.
Solana from Intermoney tells me that this year the big values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would count the two large banks and some real estate companies as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha assures the Bank of Inversis that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACPs have been on the pick-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same course, according to the expert.
As regards increased consumer behaviour during Christmas days, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only small in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December had only two declines in price trends.
At the end of 2003, when the technology bubble exploded, the stock exchange ran out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year rally.
This year, where Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed a 6.68% increase in price.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rally will show itself.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute operating under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group represents the leap dares to extend the opening hours of its branches on weekdays up to 20.30h and to start on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement with which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and will open up to them on a day of the week in the afternoon, if not for the clientele.
Whether other banks join the new initiative that adapts to business opening times will depend on the popular bank’s experience.
And this is precisely the intention that Populars are pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, because of their location, can capture the lucrative customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank would like to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as they are not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business areas, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new interior design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The bank representative in charge of Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but included an increased staffing position, as a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept on nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently manages about 2,500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they reached a preliminary agreement to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
For the first time, the Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its market value and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter he led had increased its value by twice his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too far.
Yesterday Telecinco finished the day with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento only participates in 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value amounts to 2,193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is increasing; in the case of Sogecable, to 3.571 million, to 2.518.53 million and to 1.779 million for Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días).
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, Vasile says.
Unquestionably, the question still arises as to how far we can actually act in terms of exchange technology at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to increase this year's first TV channel with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues, which was assured by Guiseppe TRINGali, the managing director of Telecinco and Publispaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales rose by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the TV business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for telecinco’s better stock market performance is the high payout ratio, which the company was able to show until now: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría launched a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that after buying 33% of the shares of endmol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares to the official compromise, even if we have so far indicated much more and more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by purchasing 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently has some trend towards loss.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculations at Telecinco by 4% this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is due to the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1% in 2008.
This also reduced Antena 3's expected profit calculations for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary elaboration, which today ended its session with the Senate Congress Decision on the supplementary/amending applications to the project, the government published the provisions arising from the new law, with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate members who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the aim of establishing the best possible regime that guarantees investor security and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, MIFID, which is re-established by the Securities Services Regulation, is pursuing an improvement in investor protection, an increase in the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) control claim and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory companies that join together with investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction management systems, adding the multilateral securities trading systems and systems to internationalise trade orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to notify the priorities of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congress Economic Commission subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the debt securities provided with titles must now be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to their high risk level, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working areas of certified economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the Regulation, which restricted the areas of work reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator working on foreign invoices, does not require authorisation from CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the acquisition of customers at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (ICI) rose by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare the location and quality of US products through the disclosure of data.
The indicator forecast can be drawn up in advance by using the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) pointed out that the pre-determined indicator should only serve as a benchmark and therefore not correspond to the final result announced next 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (ICI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI was temporary in November , while at the same time he assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes noted in the halls of the congress building that even if the current number is not good , the inflation differential between Spain and the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , announced by the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value holdings of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half after the Bank in the middle of September of last year, due to a crisis, had asked the British central bank for an emergency loan, and they now account for only 12,000 million pounds (this amounts to 16.800 million euros).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to a record GBP 25,000 million, a sum that has fallen considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and even despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
The company Virgin, which would carry on the group after taking over under the brand name Virgin Money, must spend about a quarter of the income of British banks, which will be made up of the plants there for the next three years, in order to purchase exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, who is known by his conspicuous advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to have 50,000 million pounds (corresponding to about 70 million euros) in advertising and marketing campaigns every year in order to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are still involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban-building corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in the morning, due to the urgent suspicion of urban-building corruption.
One of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were also arrested.
Last May José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales, current Member of Partido Popular and then Chairman of Totana Municipal Council, and could be the plot's original drawer, after information from the radio station Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search for the municipal and municipal business documents and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
Juan Morales' attorney was also accused of the principal suspect in the city-building corruption case discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information provided by the Cadena SER, the attorney of the popular , and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence on the basis of important burdensome documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information are reported by the alleged order payments of Morales to a Galicia construction company that envisaged the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a 200-hectare area was decided.
Eight persons are currently under investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the event of an election victory, in Congress.
José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, former Minister of Defence José Bono, has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, and he will therefore list the PSOE candidates at the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a Socialist election, take over the office of the President of the Congress.
José Blanco, PSOE's organisational secretary, and Bono, announced at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party's headquarters today.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former ministers is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the forthcoming elections, the politician from the Mancha would seem to be able to compete as chairman of the Congress for the Party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who had announced last 15 November that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead work in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had constantly pressed for his return to political events.
Moreover, he pointed out that the party , as in the appointment of Vice-President for Economic Affairs , does not want to deprive citizens of who would take over the post of the President of the Congress in the event of election , and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or screaming so as to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time one gains the impression that the only place in which one cannot speak calmly and let alone in Madrid is the Congress, so the President of the Government was interrupted once in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to appear to have taken over the office already, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate both the skeptics of climate change and those who highlight a social and political debate in this regard are subject to an unmerciful criticism, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than combating Islamic terrorism and even proposing to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings him in need of clarification regarding the action or non-action of his government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the forefront within the EU of the countries that have least met the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the requirements on which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which had proposed the agreement with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures it intends to take to combat climate change without change.
Which companies will be affected by the changes in the behaviour of citizens, the individual and collective austerity measures to be implemented and the economic consequences of this.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there has and will not be any such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures that can be put into practice against climate change are unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE-proposed petrol center appeared to be so dangerous in election strategy that it was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda and empty speech without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of adorning the meetings, and with his gentleness and goodness to inspire others.
But this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not imply that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a supposed transformation into urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the mayor’s secretary and a hotel businessman were also arrested because of the suspected suspicion of urban-building violations.
The City Council was detained at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in its premises until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the findings already made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of undeclared building ground for urban construction projects should be redesigned under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration gave it illegal commissions during the last legislation period.
In addition, two more persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigation circles, the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP member Juan Morales are also being identified.
His ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend in Murcia, are also suspected.
The chairman and holder of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have served as a sub-group of Nuaria and receive the bribe.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven more searches, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests carried out in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farming industry, which is supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was assigned to construct the largest residential complex of the town of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which it was intended to convert. The aim was to implement a construction project which would raise the community's population to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group comprises other companies such as Autesa and Inronuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specialising in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on 18 November; by the way, on that day whose issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of philosophy has become the public debate after the tragedy surrounding the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an Abiturient, who quoted in his news the works of Platos and Nietzsches.
Pekka Elo, president of the Education Council for Philosophy, asked teachers in an interview of Helsingin Sanomat daily to take a more critical position with Platon and suggested to delete Plato's teaching from the sub-level curricula for philosophy at Gymnasium.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which would be dealt with at six months' imprisonment.
However, if you again rob a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft will be classified as a criminal offence, but the penalty will be lower than in a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you clap a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still lower than with a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a beating than in a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious dispute involves a prison sentence of three to 12 months later (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange results in a liberation of six months up to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Under Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization by the authors did not take place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone has really screwed up his demands.

My home doctor presents me with one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly salary payments depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared with the help of a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the scientific journal Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonn brain research centre Life&Brain, activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to see that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and therefore received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The lawyer from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been indignant for eight years after the Balkan Wars. Her office is located in La Haya’s Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, which is based in La Haya.
Her mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - killed by the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely the Ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnic leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list of film directors Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a template for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, in Spain not yet started); a film which, with the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in its project to track the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best suited for me?
The car insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, involves a high cost, the height of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement is held in writing by means of an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged, in return, to submit the corresponding amount of the settlement in case of damages.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of a driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in the event of a higher risk of accident.
For this reason, both over 25 years of age and women have to make less contribution payments, as statistics show that thanks to their caution, these groups have a lower accident rate.
The same applies also to married persons, as according to statistical values and thus also after the conviction of the companies, they tend to be less accidents than individuals alone.
The benefit to be gained from the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
When setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We now list at this point the most important points that should be considered in the selection of an insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance-oriented, but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing low-cost insurance, such as low driving practices and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance cover to complete a full cash insurance scheme, there are still cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-cash kit with self-participation, so that the services of a full-cash insurance are covered, but are offered at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium , which is higher the lower the amount to be paid , Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, a intermediary for online insurance .
Another option is the extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not the damage caused by the car itself.
Moreover, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a piece of advice.
When you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate for the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a high yield year behind it, it may be possible to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to opt for full-time self-interest insurance.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete a full insurance scheme; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
Insurers' side, couples with children are considered to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are low.
In this case, a full-time self-participation insurance (at an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit rating, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete a full-time self-interest insurance scheme (with an amount of EUR 150), or to complete an extended insurance scheme, which is only used in the case of a sufficiently high credit rating.
In the end, one must state that car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the driver from possible damage to the accident, but also because it has high costs which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth finale in Milan
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting next Tuesday in San Siro for the point they lack to reach their respective goals even before the completion of the Championsleague preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while they decide on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an undecided decision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar does not catch up with Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA World Club Championship in Japan, where he will be fighting for the first time for entry to the final on the 13th in the semifinal, which will take place on 16th.
So this group will be finished in front of everyone else and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the widely expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be the winner in the event of a victory group first and thus have a better starting position in the Eighth Final.
Gordon Strachan’s team might even have a defeat to qualify for a lap of FC Shakhtar. Nevertheless, he should not be overly confident in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are entitled to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but were able to win the second match (2-0).
Thus, the mailmen will try to avoid the Scots in the evening. They hope to reach the second round of the final of the redesigned Championsleague for the second time in a row after they were defeated in the previous season in exactly the same round by a goal of Kaka in the postgame period (1-0) and by a zero to zero on the lead.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the Eighth Final and its membership at the UEFA depend on its victory and defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could gain third place, despite its lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in front of 20,000 viewers in the Canadian Vancouver for their first tour after the band dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the atmosphere in the reunited band is excellent.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold out stadium, where a video on the history of the band, which had provided for Furore at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which contains its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, which appears in Spain under the EMI label.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which the husband of Posh Spice had previously given them, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans who made the GM Palace glow, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden it to him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British star didn't get to face our wardrobe once and for all, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's gonna think of the show.
Sporty Spice, whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later drew the break-up of the group, expressed her nervousness at a press conference two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And therefore I thought why not; so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself at the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also made it clear that the disputes were eliminated and that everyone is now very much in love with them.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, following a report by the TV station CTV.
On their arrival at the airport, the band was received by a army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and December 7th).
In Madrid they will be staged on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of affecting Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are managed by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow is taking place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more because the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% in addition to natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency Reuters.
"The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This subsequently led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas constitutes a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas deposits in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own stocks of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve checks on the criminal records for workers from outside Europe, said one member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the principal financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish state health service had no precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in the case of a sample of five health authorities.
The principal financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October and was burdened with the alleged car bomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the recruitment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the auditors now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Executive Board should take up guidelines for the collection of criminal records which help employers in controlling different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some personnel documents, they have not been routinely carried out," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines with a high degree before employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health professionals is available."
BMA Scotland President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could face future terrorist attacks in the run-up to the recruitment of potential NHS staff.
"The report says that present pre-selection tests by NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards had problems identifying those employees who are on leave for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures have been observed by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-arrangement controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding the monitoring studies would reflect before all employees are employed, including those from abroad, whose publication is planned next month.

The award for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenberg's London-playing Thriller Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is called to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize, named in honour of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my kind of person, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had captured 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant, as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells would have planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathians of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-man fast intervention force to protect installations after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, with reference to a Ministerial statement, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a " rocket expert" who immigrated illegally into the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
According to the report, a further 22 of the prisoners had committed the killing of religious and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join forces with Al Qaeda militias who want to fight the Allied armed forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the Hardliners under the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen regards many clergymen in Saudi Arabia as cooperating with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to the pro-Western Saudi government - have opted for foreign housing, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This was a very great effort on the part of the security forces over the last... five months," said a State TV spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior.
The arrests also involved a 16-year-old "media cell" from Medina, which aimed to advertise for the "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are branded as infidels and apostates.
Among the prisoners were 32 people who were accused of providing the militia with financial support.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a wandering twin of the earth than was previously conscious.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is somewhat closer.
Billions of years ago, scientists believe that the Venus conditions had been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable today.
However, due to the unbridled carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plant for a year, offer an sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different to that of Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data makes it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment."
"Enriched Uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesperson said that three people were arrested and that the material was examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
With Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to hold a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters recorded questions on video and submitted them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who questioned Democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that will break into the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate that selected YouTube clips to show the upcoming candidates.
However, immigration was at the heart of the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic.
The topic is one of the most striking topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to use a dial when they heard things they liked: The television station noticed peaks of consent when the candidates spoke strictly about the boundaries.
The strongest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who has moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to shake his reputation that he had been diligent about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two asked themselves particularly strongly as a question whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to check this issue.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they have leaned earlier and harder than others on the immigration squad.
At least in the area of immigration, the candidates share the same views in general: tougher borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to take the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent Iowa survey thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see whether Jesus would support them, he laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donation successes and his applause storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slippery.
No noble titles seem to have been sold, no politicians paid Paris hotel bills, no extra-marital toes had been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) on behalf of the British ruling Labour Party for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that the controversial Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister withdrew the call for a election, insulting the British intelligence in a stupid way by claiming that polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly bold representative of the Liberal Democrats, who expressed it, the once feared Brown of Stalin has developed into Mr. Bean.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly well thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have imposed corporate associations against the government.
The tax-advisable loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative monies.
A trio of generals retired started an uprising in the Upper House out of protest against cuts in military spending: being Minister of Armed Forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and her former executional director) has already resigned.
None of this means that Brown breaks off irrevocably.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point, after which they feel impossible to govern.
Neither do people still trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force takes office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he will not even have to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service is beginning to be empty; the Cabinet Minister is starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he would deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's miscarriage - as in the long "money for noblests" investigation of political party financing - the voters might assume that it was him.
Even so, Brown's situation isn't as bad as she looks.
The sins are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely sloppy.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's of course has always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new art of political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske Abrahams, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, does not want to be publicly recognized for his goodwill.
This may be the case, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financier, who was told about the odd donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his takeover in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure, from a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "teaching lessons to be drawn" are not very complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's one thing for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr Brown needs to do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months and move forward with a radical reform of political party financing.
This would require the Labour hardliners to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a party partner such as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is by irrevocable fairness and solid competence.
Card shark
Is the credit crisis in America turning the credit card market on?
If blood is in the water, it's only natural that the back floss is swirling around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is collapsing, the predators have the country's credit card market in the visor.
Analyses of Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach 99 billion dollars if the risk of infection of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the payouts and the hedging rates, which measure the proportion of loans that are not recoverable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection from its American consumer finance, partly because of the weakness of credit card recipients.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and seams are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to a abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which in turn account for a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus hedging fees) would again increase whether the general conditions for creditors deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on sound payment rates showing how much of its debt consumers pay off every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the spending amounts for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the property credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly available: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debts, now that home loans are drying out.
However, the card issuers look at the flow of money instead of capital values, so the house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even be of advantage to card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers who continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if the real estate is less than the value of the loan; as a result, the credit card debt becomes more important among the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's main financial consultant.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more fierce future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron's case
Three British bankers who were to be brought to trial for their role in the fraudulent system with the former Chief Finance Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their applications on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for conspiring with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in the UK during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case is a loose end to an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations initially filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the aim of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron defeat.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they had come to Houston in 2000 to hook up a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machines that helped to tear the company into the bankruptcy strudel.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had considerable value.
One company under Kopper's control acquired the Bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow wrongly represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper, and others canceled about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his role in the Enrons Pleite in two counts of conspiracy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is sentenced to six years in prison in Louisiana Federal Prison.
Copper has a penalty of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail, which made it necessary to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, collapsed in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debts or make weak businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges became void after he died last year due to heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulf Stream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' exhibition, a four-day orgy of the show's consumer, which was held in a nested exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahogany-dominated yachts to diamond-coated autogrills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand in the visor.
"That's a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems as flooded with money as Dallas was at its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian flyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most visible generous money publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold rush.
Anderswo in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, LVMH's president, moved to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are second class, worth 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written here by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women are all well-kept, and men are all worthy of wealth."
While they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, refer to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to aim primarily at the new realms, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in storage for several hours to visit a suitable warehouse, which inadvertently put Cadillac Escalades, platin pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotic at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climate changers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the type of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pressed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the General Manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with stitched gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said that his company had sold the gruesome orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170,000 dollars.
By Sunday afternoon, the President of L.A. Connection, Andrei Karapetian, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said he would have sold three auto cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is the same chain tires that are connected to each other, for 55,000 dollars.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulitad.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-seater.
"The Russian millionaire, the street leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise of the present property prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a state operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed out 500,000 false banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the piles of money, mobile phone photos, while leaning back in the middle of the spare wealth, letting friends cut off, or simply insert a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Busted operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest feast when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance on the white Cape Cod held two doors further down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the cart of the medical examiner arriving," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the lead point of the Newark police.
Since September 2006, Ms. Arroyo was an assistant to police director, Garry F. McCarthy, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and stubborn," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephon interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control commission, leaving two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County State Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the ways," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And she found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house that is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to tell me if Mrs. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a bleak rose shrub stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the lower floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him cope with the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates leading to a rise in world stock markets
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic, after market hopes that the central bank will try to reassure the credit markets with further interest cuts were supported by complaints from the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that politics had to react "flexible and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm divisive markets, in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulence had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further reductions in interest rates.
The performances also helped to calm Wall Street, in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that the sales of US properties reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence have been underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost US mortgage credit markets.
It is expected that only 20 of these stations will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289.40, while the wider-designed S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 Index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax Index rose by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 rose by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resurgence of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks had been granted a significant 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow, and to feed further capital into the money markets in London, increased as the credit tensions saw the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks rising by 6.59% to their peak since late September, following a continuous increase since November 21.
England confronts with decision on the statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, one nearly as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, is on call at least under this special title, here to help the chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide to help, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which in part time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth beat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what a person allows to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to shah when he does it?
The same may also be asked in a further area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good grades, who know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go to sleep.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but there are opportunities for this too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a Wicket and a racket must get regular chances in order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the electorate is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, when James Anderson was going to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explained himself to be healthy and how the wind kindled into the nets.
Anderson took 32 prime Wickets each with 33 Runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hopes for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling at the time to consolidate himself, who made the breakthrough a major test-cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan and Moores are likely to follow their conservative instincts and sense of stomach for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after another discussion at the current network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 top-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the momentum from his blow, which was still obvious in Bombay.
In contrast, the all-rounder from Essex has a sense of joy in life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket spot and his attitude aside was brought to the point when he had recently crossed a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from afar, and with enthusiasm to say, "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his mid tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand there well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buss bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with an electricity of displaced persons whose funds or visas expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, regarding the Shiite militias of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the overwhelming Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local US-backed militia helped to expel Al-Qaida from her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven out of his house in Slykh in the north of Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the Anti-Al-Qaida militias in Slijkh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the U.S. increase and the growth of local "crowded citizens" who armed and defended their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and sloppy money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister who had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably escaped from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well to visit al-Maliki Syria and the government urged Iraqis no more to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunni were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have been left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will revive sectarian tensions and conflict will arise.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarland have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've told a non-Saar country yesterday for the 50th time that we're not French" - this slogan records the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is in fifth place in the educational monitor of the Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft Köln (IW).
The universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries in this way from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland to the universities in an above average number - many of them without a degree at the secondary school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
More than one fifth of young people acquire their qualifications at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also considerably increased.
According to the population, the equipment with dual study courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"We have launched a number of reforms in general schools following the first Pisa study," says one State Department spokesperson.
This is how the government carried out country-wide comparison tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of Kita is free of charge - a model that now also copies other states.
Whether the performance of the students improves sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa in 2003, the share of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other Länder.
The Bayern expect better.
And to the brink of the Saarland, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could score otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbours is a duty to Gymnasia - even if the Saarland countries are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez turned back the timepieces in the South American country by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to Venezuela’s Official Journal, a new law says that the clocks are adjusted to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez explained his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world imposed full hours on the division into time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced the termination of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage deal.
The left nationalist said that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not be treated as head of state or as a Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is pursuing constitutional reform, about which the citizens of the Olande have to vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly increase his power in the country.
The originator of the dispute was Uribes' decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spucked your face" in Venezuela's decision to criticize Chávez on Sunday.
Chávez is also in all mouths in Spain.
A new mobile ringtone provides Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already downloaded over half a million people from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the recent Ibero-America summit had been embarrassed by the constant calls of the left populist and who had gone over his mouth.
German threatens in 2007 wage-minus
In spite of the strong economic climate, German workers are facing real wage losses as a result of a forecast this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could actually expect less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price increase in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Image" newspaper.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrück Newspaper", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was in the current situation correct and reasonable.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency should not be again embarrassed to ask the Federal Government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven the inflation rate to the highest level for 13 years.
Prices increased by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the Hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its life-enhancing atmosphere on earth, Venus Express has been more like it has so far been thought: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind swirls at the Poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists suspect that it flashes on Venus.
Now, the European probe "Venus Express" has provided proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunderstorms should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not like that on Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on the earth, it also has temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil's will on earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken on such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Isaiah mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early nineties no longer a probe was on the way to research this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results, which are now presented in several "nature" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities between our neighboring planet and Earth are greater than initially assumed," says Esa.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents on the Earth’s winter hemisphere, a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaciale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is nearly the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also referred to as morning or evening star, crosses the sun in almost 225 days.
But it rotates much slower around itself: a Venus day takes 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Water was collected on both sides, which remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide on earth is fixed in carbonic rocks, it is the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler requests an end to the party's dispute to receive the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler looks after Germany and has asked the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"For me, human rights have universal validity, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the reproach, she pursued a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly shown animosity over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from a number of parts of the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the Chancellor's Office, there were violent irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries according to information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against scratches as in France
Road Battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against scratches as in France.
All things had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge into violence on the road, the Federal Minister of the Interior demanded.
Barricadens burned, Randalier shot the police with shotguns: According to the heavy youth crises in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must ensure that we do not also build up social explosives and discharge them into violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
Federals, countries and municipalities have already been working hard to reduce problems, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam conference, this is already showing first successes."
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there were no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs of Paris, young people delivered heavy road battles with the police in the past nights.
Also in Toulouse burned cars and public buildings.
In contrast, Kenan Kolat, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In view of the disasters in France, Kolat warned against "effects of counterfeiting".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background is "over average" below 25 years.
More training places should be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "a social control takes place in the families".
Moreover, many young people with a migrant background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But we still have to be careful."
Young people must be given "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were working, a helicopter overflyed the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the day before, a total of around 1000 security forces have been providing rest.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
During the night on Tuesday, some 80 policemen were injured at the Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight, the unrest seized Toulouse.
The cranes were inflamed by a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the prosecutor's first findings, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the realm of Angela Wolke
The firm's realistic appearance demonstrates that the coalition is in the end - and that there is nothing to be expected of itself.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After their hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country which had to be ruled by it at last.
Angela Merkel has rejected the accusation that she is too focused on foreign policy with an overbearing sentence.
It was provincial, she said, and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag it has documented to everyone how much their reproach is true.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a distant politician who flees into foreign policy and even stays in danger there.
For example, climate protection: since it praises itself unrestrictedly for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how the climate targets are to be achieved in this country.
Overall, the self-governance - so much indecisiveness the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floss that the upswing arrives with humans.
She thus corrupts her image as a pragmatist who solves the problems rather than nice talking to the world.
But in the realm of Angela Cloude, internal policy problems are an embodiment.
Child poverty and the anxieties of low earners?
She's left a few side sentences for that.
It is significant how often it promises when it comes to child support.
Three approaches, Merkel needs to get out a half-way straight set.
It stumbles like a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide themselves with a hard hit change - and must now fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already at hand on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Giuliani.
This counters heavy accusations on his part: "I would say his own house was a port for illegals," said Giuliani, suggesting to the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Since the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates are mainly using the debate on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The self-winded 30-second videos that internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than taggers.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain suggests to his opponent Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also reads powerfully from Vietnam veterans the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of questioning that simulates drowning as a torture.
However, the fact that the major topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and the debate on torture shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, applause burns up in the auditorium.
This shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, and tells the audience that he was still one of the abduction supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that in his opinion he is asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as Head of the Army, Musharraf, Pakistani ruler, has been declared President.
This will end eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President, Pervez Musharraf, has been sworn for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistan's television broadcast the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as chief of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus had to face international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unblooded military coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces Musharraf had fulfilled a core requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another key requirement is an end to the state of emergency that Musharraf had imposed on 3 November.
Soon after his extermination, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency and thus meet a further request from the West.
Last week, the Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with its weighted lawyers following the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, rejected all the objections against the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in a military convoy in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan and four more wounded.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Krautrock Return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies again plays: The three band members of Harmonia once again performed their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival appears a mid-section from their great time "Live 1974".
At that time they were much more famous abroad.
The traumatized sensation then takes place in the form of three men seated at the evening table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and especially their buttons.
Dieter Moebius crowns in the blood-white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated at the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the Lords themselves greatly.
That the band plays Harmonia again has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here you can unveil: Targeted demand showed that while the name was confused by collective pop memory, it was by no means so sustainable to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the Germans not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially what is called misleading Krautrock, in England and America was always considered more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Lifetime Work to the survivors of the Cologne group Can 2003, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New! in the Laudatio, the wonder did not know any limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later hit the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the disparity in the foreign world is that one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years and also developed a much lower power of action during that time than they were later assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First of all, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label held by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped with Kraftwerk and then became a guitarist at Neu!, the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague as a nanny.
It's in a very high-profile artist's mind.
It is also said that in the dungeon there was also a name for the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so quiet and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection was not the sole purpose of self-invention.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record setting of almost 50 people, as someone believes to be invented.
At that time, Rother wanted to force and practice harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
==References====External links==
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Heart".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griesseer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to live music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the Brit, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of influences of the Krautrock would be crossed to the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia is used to fill the space of the super group.
The set of Brian Eno hovers with the most distinct sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legend is used for projections of further black and white photos of wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unwind the instruments via self-armed effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically Intensive Tüftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, sound clouds are coughed and whipped and sung in a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never rock.
The roots were sought out less in blues than in music colleges (Can), technologies (kraftwerk) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Anyone who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not able to get away from it now.
The most obvious thing is carefully considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob you of the nerves or give you a lot of good luck with fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and ballers or but they are too touching.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but especially there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia-Herzegovina, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties last, because too many nice-interested roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism drove one's desire to see.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (Why do movie titles have to be as long today and will be like the driver's tarif contracts?)
He provides a wonderfully eye-catching portrayal: In essence, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been out of Gere, if the fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has been behind his very best times, but who has preserved himself as a ruins-like monument of his decline still considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" is continuing together with the German production of "Mörderischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
You can make a brief process with "Morterian peace": The film deals with two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbian from Kosovar hedgehogs, on which one instantly falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once represented as the sole root of all evils, the television film loses itself all too quickly in ballers and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for this with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be just exemplaryly explored, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to track down the Serbian super-war criminal "the Fuchs" could have been a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and screenwriter (both in personnel union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are similar: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military can't, and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the fallen cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must up above a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" will go down the stream if the reporters within the last five minutes of the time-lapse process succeed what NATO, CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the Kinologik.
The film has a profound human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (in this case they are supposed to agree exceptionally) not to overly pursue the persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good common and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see the swollen foreheads compassionately, indicating how strenuous it is to be evil".
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same tailheads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: there has never been a good South Africa movie.
Almost always: If a star is drifting around on the world's crisis springs or minefields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close at the time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood was able to film a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to mature - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" now in force as a classic have never been celebrated as a masterpiece.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes at home on just two screens, too much too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the screenwriters of the disquiet they need to tell good stories.
After all, "being or not being" or "the great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you have to have the sarcastic distanced look at the artist of Romancians Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked to parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Big cities will always be terrible dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
By Beust reaps criticism for Olympia Absage
The resignation of the mayor from the application of Hamburg for the Olympic Summer Games has been strongly criticised by politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beus, realism points to the assessment of opportunities.
On Wednesday, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the chief managing director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, declared a "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Without this goal, the pace of sport policy could not be maintained to the same degree."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "out of a changed time beam".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least by the year 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out the expected decision of the Sports Federation on an application for the Winter Games in Munich in early December 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have been considering until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not always dreamed out, said by Beus.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build up a chance by burying the plans already at this point," said HSB President Günter Plooß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Head of Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General German Association of Higher Education Sports.
In 2015, von Beus described Hamburg's application for the 2015 Universiade as a "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only nominated Hamburg as an applicant city in the past week.
The SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraction accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has put on the Olympics card and blocked out the construction of the apartment," said the SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for integrated planning for the small grassbrook for Olympia and a later use of housing, the CDU has set one-sidedly on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had triggered a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who combine the concepts of Sweden and wooden chests think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, in Sweden, fabricated wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" had raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Briillo boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: The six "Briillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has made as a gift to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of the more than a hundred more Briillo boxes from the "type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The prehistory is nestled, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cardboard of soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet 1968 - with Warhol's consent - exhibited hundreds of Briillo boxes from cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Briillo-Cartonagenfabrik.
It was not works of art, it was their role models, it was just exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses now speak of around fifteen boxes, which have rightly entered the art and auction history as an authorized original andy-warhol-brillo boxes called "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have generated more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then left to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was already three years dead.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also studied three Swedish private estates, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first founded and embroidered, and then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the colour was applied directly to the press plate with a painting roll without a foundation, and it is not an oil-, but an acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Briillo Boxes", says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, of course, the Authentication Board announced that it would proceed with the "serious accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then, they have shrouded themselves in unforgivable silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who had been accused of corruption and electoral fraud by the president, reporters at the hotel.
The hotel had previously been used by government - based soldiers for tear - gas use.
The about two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood in court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were actually supposed to guard him, apparently passed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government troops locked the district around the fancy hotel.
The president called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the Scout Rangers' elite unit, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the president for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed for months by corruption charges.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours to refuse the army to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies have set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with Freenet's share of good ten percent and do not make use of their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept open all their options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it was said.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had been concluded in mid-November.
The poker around Freenet, which has been ongoing for months and is still difficult to understand, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of the United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares so far.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will add around four percent.
The right to buy the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
