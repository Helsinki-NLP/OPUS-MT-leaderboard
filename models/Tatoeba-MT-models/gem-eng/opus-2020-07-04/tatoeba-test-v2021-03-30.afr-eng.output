I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'd be now.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.

Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I’m saving so I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You must have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God had not existed, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
In autumn, when the weather broke, windy and wet, and the cold could enter the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.

I'm your father.
You'll pay for it.
I had a place to keep looking.
Tom has a lot on his plate.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot about her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be that easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
That's really nice!
The river flowing by Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
