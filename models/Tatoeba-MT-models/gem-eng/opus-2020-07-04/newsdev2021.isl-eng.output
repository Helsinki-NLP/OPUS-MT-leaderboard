Biden leads the polls in three key countries
In just 100 days of election, Joe Biden, a candidate of the Democratic Party, takes advantage of three important countries.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden measures 51% and 46%, respectively.
In Arizona, the situation is 49%-45% of Biden's will and in Michigan, leading to Biden's superiority, which leads to 12 points, 52%-40%.
To win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump must turn all of these, and indeed more.
Trump, who is now living with a crowned virus epidemic, has been teaching him to an increasing extent, saying that most of the people in question have reacted badly, or very badly at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump’s rejection has resulted from protests and riots that erupted at George Floyd’s death.
Trump and his government have dealt badly with them or wronged them.
To crown Trump's problems, he is now under serious criticism for ordering federal police to break up protests in cities where mayors or governors are Democrats.
It has created enormous ulfew among the inhabitants of the cities, and it is inflamed by the anger of other Americans.
Similarly, pictures of federal policemen taking Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the cause of the United States.
The Lincoln Project just paid attention to this, but it can be seen from the bottom.
Trump won all three kingdoms in 2016, but with very little vote.
In fact, Trump won many states with little vote and won the elections with a minor vote.
Michigan, for example, defeated him with only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Almost all the surveys that political experts say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is being taken forward.
A new study by CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advances are now seen from the margins of the survey.
The same is true of the CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned well to the right and declared support for Trump in 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The president’s final hope, according to the findings of the question, is that if the campaign focuses on the economy, Trump could hope to come back to important locations within the region.
The U.S. economy suffered a severe blow following the Covid-19 epidemic, but the voters do not seem to link the economic crisis with the Korean virus epidemic.
That is, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for being in a bad position to react to the Korean virus epidemic, but they are more confident that he will deal with the economic crisis that the state is currently experiencing.
However, Trump has failed to direct the debate in the campaign.
Following the riots that have been burning almost continuously from the news of the video, alarmingly, four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion on law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his characteristic.
Now it seems to have failed completely, as said before.
As the opinion leans more on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to divorce Trump and declare support for Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without a particular name.
This is because of an arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
In this way, voting can simply signify to the second class of the electoral section of the ballot, and act alone as a vote for all of its other candidates on the voting list.
In this way, candidates of the Republican Party are tempted to break free from the slow pace of Trump’s election and to achieve success in the elections.
The Youth Olympics in Dakar postponed until 2026
The Olympic Games of Youth were to be held in Dakar next year, which has now been postponed until 2026 because of the crown virus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed.
However, the postponement of the first Olympic Games to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for Nantes fire
A volunteer in the cathedral of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a fire that destroyed the church.
Le Monde has noted that the suspected refugee from Rwanda who served as a church overseer admitted to having set fire.
The man’s lawyer, in conversation with another media, says that man sees his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was the 17th - century organ and the historic windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer was arrested shortly after the 18th of July, but was thus released.
He was then returned to a report yesterday and then arrested in custody.
"No way out of it"
I am well received at Baltasar’s and Christian Samper’s homes in Copavogi.
The occasion for my visit is a new show of art by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1st in the Little Kambi Hall on Snow.
Is this the first time the father shows up?
I'm led down to Baltasar's workshop, where a magnificent painting faces me.
Big and gloomy pictures of the girls of the past, but also of flying creatures; eagles on one, shadows of birds on the other.
The workshop is extended to the home.
“ We had a horse here with us that bit the grass, ” Baltasar tells me.
"The horse works much better than a slot machine on these hills and hills that we have."
Mireya and I are with Christ and Baltasar, and she tells of how her works are related to the works here.
“Insulations, combined with paperwork and cutlery.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, since I'm working with the light and like this," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works I was working on and wanted to show there, but they were stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I re-thinked my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong lead in Icelandic legends about female cows and wets.
“When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the ladies, I felt that I was the perfect person to do the jewelry that was associated with them,” says Mireya, who works with Victory Inga Bjarnasoni’s goldsmith in Sign’s shop.
"That's how I make an insertion out of the cut."
Last year, the Mireya exhibition brought 72 artists to the Academy of Sensitivity at Snæfellsnes, including the Little-Kambi Hall, and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old store that has just been developed,” says Mireya, who spoke there to a Baldvina Sverristaught artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar put together a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in 1938 in Spain and attended the Art University of Barcelona before taking a world tour to study art collections and study.
He visited Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
Here he came back a short time later, met his wife, Christia, and has lived here ever since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar is an effective artist, has conducted dozens of private shows, and shows with Christ’s people.
It is best known for its large wall pictures, which include wall decoration in the Flatey Church and fresco in the Widestand Church.
"What affects what I do is the bitterness of Iceland and no other place," says Baltasar.
“ These low suns and these shadows that are stretched and stretched.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, you can work here."
Mireya is the eldest children of Kristjönu and Baltasar, born 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to become an artist, ” she said, asking if she wanted to follow in the footsteps of her parents.
“ So I went on a math and physics path to high school and did everything I could to get away from it.
Then I realized I was running away.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya, laughing.
She has, like her father, shown worldwide.
A lot of Japan to take.
All the children of Baltasar and of Christ have walked on the road.
"I call this virus," Mireya says.
"There was no way out of this."
Icelandair's count has been in grey areas when airlines were canceled
Minister of Social Affairs considers that the Icelandic Air has been in a grey area when the company terminated all airmen in the middle of the Käradeil.
Then he says that laws that would mean firemen to enter the apartment building will be taken into consideration after the fire at the Brethren’s gate.
On July 17, Icelandair was about to give up all the 38 flight attendants who were working with the company while the Kiradeil of the Air Carrier Society was still on the table of a state sponsor.
The claims were based on whether Icelandair was able to intervene and was prepared to resolve the matter for the Society.
This was never the end of the day, however, when the pilots and the Icelandair got together for more than a day after the layoffs.
However, Minister of Social Affairs, Einar Dadason, says that to his mind, the decision made by Icelandair was in a grey area and went to the right paycheck.
“ My opinion is that this is a certain right to defend the payers.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in a room with a convict, it's not an option to go this way.
It is perfectly clear to me that this would not have happened.
I think it's quite clear, in my mind, that men were entered into a gray area where what this touches," says Ásmundur.
He will not thus speak for other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
"You also now see a dangerous discussion about the fact that it is only natural to jump this system up to reduce this right, and so I am totally opposed."
This morning, Assmundur was also asked about the reaction of government to the burning of the Brethren River at the end of June, where three died.
The Secretary says the study of the matter now on the table of the House and the Human Resources Agency, to which he has direct instructions.
“ It is within the law today that the fire department must not go into an apartment building.
I've been asking the Institute for Humanities, especially to see if there's a reason to make some legal changes.
I am ready to make the legal changes needed to reduce the likelihood of such a thing happening again," says Einard.
The interview with Asmund can be listened to as a whole in the player below.
U.S. reported increasing pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. government has made further efforts to force European companies to resign from Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, led by Russia, according to Welt am Sunday, to testify to people who are familiar with the topic.
According to the newspaper, officials from the U.S. Foreign Office, the U.S. Treasury, and the U.S. Energy Agency have contacted European agencies to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the protests said that the United States had placed emphasis on the United States’ desire to prevent Nord Stream 2 from being realized.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one maid at the German press.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, last week, when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best placed to "come out now" or risk punishment according to 232 parts of the notorious Counting America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to Russian energy leader Gazprom, who is responsible for the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
This is the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch Shell company as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with World on Sunday, the representative of the last - mentioned company said that the US attempts to undermine “a major inaugural project ” would be a clear intervention in the state of Europe.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Assembly approved a change in legislation on national defences aimed at extending sanctions against companies participating in the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one of the law - enforcement agents, investigations can be directed to companies that pay for, or provide ship, insurance, portability, or liaison services for such ships, as well as those who offer a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of US efforts to trade in European energy by punishing Nord Stream 2, some of them even calling for Brussels to carry out countermeasures.
Moscow officials have also criticized the Washington action and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the president’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan for the completion of the project if Washington officials were to keep the new sanctions under stress.
Preparing for further transport of the public institutions to the country
The Minister for Social Affairs and the Minister for Children is planning to transfer more public agencies to the country in the near future.
In the autumn, the Minister’s decision will be taken by the Brunavanna of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Human Resources, but experts within the department have previously declared that they are not planning to move northwards.
Einar Dadason, Secretary of State for Social Affairs and Children, said this morning at Splengisand in the Bay that it is important for the countryside that public institutions be moved there.
Therefore, there is a high level of value creation that also produces diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Employment building, the cost-economy structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, any use of nature, and this kind of public service work, they are very supportive of that structure," says Ásmundur.
"Creating increased diversity, creating better support for this resource use and the creation of the nation."
Assmundar's decision to transfer fire brigades to the Home Affairs and Human Resources Agency has been severely criticised by its employees and by the National Association of Fire and Disease Carriers.
Six men who have knowledge of fires and work in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them are going to move their cattle to Söðjörkók.
“ I think it’s quite clear that there are political differences in how hard this should be done.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should take radical measures to distribute the public jobs more fully," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbors, Norwegians, and Danir have been doing this successfully.”
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution in public institutions around the country.
"I think there is a need to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Institute of Cultural Affairs and Humanities."
He takes examples of the transportation of Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland’s Landspächnigna till Akranness, and Social Security at Skagaströd.
“ There is a workplace in Skagastrand today that is very important to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this being."
“ I am preparing for further steps in this being.
More transport."

Doctor ran 35 kilometers with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran on days 25 miles [35 km] with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with face masks.
Lawton, a doctor at the Bradford Royal Hospital, has worked there during the pandemic.
To deny the idea of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and back with a mask.
Before leaving, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“ I am a great supporter of all those who keep us safe.
That's why I've been in shock about the wrong information that's been passed on between people's face masks reducing people's oxygen saturation," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed for three years, but during the pandemic, he had been reduced toleration.
On Monday, he ran 35 miles [35 km].
"I never took off the mask (no food or drink) and the oxygen saturation went out 98% every time I looked," said Lawton on Twitter, after he had finished running.

Gottlieb warns that the proliferation of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, warned on Sunday that opening a new academic year would be “very difficult ” for school cases if the crowning virus spreads smoothly within these communities.
“ I think the school authorities need to look at the distribution within the community.
If the virus spreads unhindered in society, it will be very difficult to open up in that situation," said Gottlieb in Face the Nation.
As the autumn begins next week, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and to offer school lessons in schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the Korean virus epidemic would likely “suppose before he recovers ” and confirmed that school example in places where the worst situation may be required to delay school opening for a few weeks.
Still, on Thursday, medical centers issued guidelines on the safest way to open school to students.
Among other things, the guide calls for distance in schools between people’s safety, students, and staff to use facial protection and for students to be divided into particular groups to reduce the number of infectious diseases.
However, medical centers did not publish a standard for school managers when they should close schools if crown virus infection is increasing, as Gottlieb says, has been “unlucky”.
“ When this uncertainty prevails and precise guidance is not given on how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
"That is why I think it is very important to get detailed information on the precise nature of the criteria that the disease control centres did not provide in their instructions."
Gottlieb said school example must think about the percentage of positive infections in society, local distribution, and testing skills when deciding whether to keep schools open, or to switch them all over to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10% of the analyses give a positive conclusion, "the matter is going to get in trouble" but over 10% is "the threshold when carefully considering whether to close the exams."
“ This is a sign that the epidemic has reached a foothold in society,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make the affairs of Florida, the center of the U.S. Korean virus epidemic, difficult to open up for schooling next month.
Korean virus infections have increased to more than 30 states and to Colombia’s territory than the continent’s center of the epidemic is currently standing in the sunbelt called the South Coast of the United States.
Gottlieb said, though, that there was evidence that the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas, had begun to slow down.
However, despite the fact that Gottlieb had said there was a “significant sign” that the epidemic had begun to slow down in some states in the solar field, the “heating in the coals” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India, and Illinois.
Many governors have established rules that require people to use masks in public spaces and stopped the initial reopening to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that the government should consider closing the courts, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing cinemas and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on the use of masks to overcome the epidemic, which are actions that enable rich people to avoid resuming the strict limits set at the beginning of the March epidemic.
In addition to what various countries have made use of masks, various companies have obliged people to use facial shields.
Suddenbitist McDonald's is the latest company to make use of facial protection and thus add to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have put their own rules on mask use.
Gottlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masked responsibility with him, especially since the threat is considered to be high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when the winter comes to us until we get vaccines or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something that we can all do but that doesn’t change our lives directly and allows us to keep what is very important to us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Although Donald Trump did not say last week that he wanted to make use of masks in the whole country, he urged the Americans last week to use facial defenses and said at the White House press conference that “they had an impact. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "It's a good thing to expect"
The adherents of Crystal Palace received a plaque for the summer when Roy Hodgson, director of the Society, declared that the parishioner Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The elephant boarder has played at Selhurst Park for more than five years and seems now to be leaving, but he has previously been described as a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether the members of that quality class are still willing to pay him high sums, especially in the financial uncertain times of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four limits and made five supports for the Palace team, which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that "the news is to be expected" regarding the possible departure of Zaha after confirming that the visitor had "made it clear" that he saw his future elsewhere than the company.
Three years have yet to come from the applicant’s contract with Palace, and last year the Society indicated that 100 million sterling dollars would be needed to get the partner to beat him down.
Hodgson finished the period with seven losses in a row and a tie on the last day of the period, resulting in the team falling to 14th place.
Zaha found the nets only once from the middle of December to the end of the period with a long shot of loss against Chelsea.
He had been reported asking for sale last summer when he tried to get rid of his partner, but no offer was offered to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the manager's office in January, so it seems to increase the likelihood of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks it will undoubtedly be the priority of him to ensure social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the superior English department for Palace during the season and was the only player in the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction of the team might be necessary to manage with the funds available to the player.
Hanna’s Hurricane: The Korean virus virus in Texas faces a high risk of disasters in the “two-faced barrier”
Weather reporters have predicted “past floods ” in southern Texas after Hanna’s hurricane reached twice in the country, bringing heavy rains and windpower up to 40 meters per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-level storm (low-level five-grade scale) and has now been brought down into the tropical storm, but rain could still be swaying 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters in seconds.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first hurricane in the Atlantic in 2020, and weather forecaster Chris Birchfield advised residents to be on guard: “This is not near the end yet, and we are still expecting disasters. ”
In the last few weeks, Texas has experienced a large increase in coronary virus infection.
The director Greg Abbott issued a disaster report for 23 cities that will take place along the way of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult where the hurricane passes through areas that have become worst affected by COWID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5: 00 p.m. on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, some 210 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christus.
The second time was not far from, in the east part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including the Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
A relief service in Christ’s Corpus set up a park near the street to allow it to be used if the floods over the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States said in a dozen times that the government was watching Hanna and Douglas, a hurricane heading toward the Pacific Ocean.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the shore of the Corpus Christi, said that the storm approaching had heightened the anxiety she felt because of the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with COPD.
She said: “It’s almost like a double cry for us.
I think a lot of people are nervous.
We'll get through this.
It's all good and strong and stand together."
Hospitation on a bloating sail in South Africa
In some cases, the weather has been favourable to farmers.
Most of them have had their first slenderness, and another slaughter is widely launched, and some are expected to reach third at the end of the summer.
The weather has been going on with the Sunnland farmers, like the other inhabitants of the area in the summer, and it has not spoiled the spruce on the tune farmers.
Heyshit's been doing a good job.
Victory of Augustus the Son of Man, a farmer in Birtingaholt in the Huruna race, and a workman in court are happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been very good, I think farmers must just be broke, it’s been a nice walk, and it’s been a really good weather for the last half of the month.
Heyin' are very good ends of the harvest good and the goodness of the sharks neatly over," says Sigurd.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in cow farmers, that they are hay in flat pits or plots, which have been given very well, but it is a long way to do the most in the rollers.
“ It’s vivid, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the past six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and it’s so comfortable to deal with it.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be stored until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But does Sigurd think that some farmers will strike three times?
“ Yes, I could believe what was first.
We started on June 17, it may well be that those who were first had to take three times something."
Initial solution for the wolves - This is how they prevent injury
The edgeman Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is an enormously fast player.
His opposers have had it to take hold of him to make sure that he does not get past them.
This has led to his shoulder dropping several times out of a team, but now the wolves have come up with a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In Wolves game against Crystal Palace, the paramedics were allowed to see something grappling on Traoré's shoulders.
“ This is something we had to do to protect Traoré, ” says a Volves source who was carrying it as a child’s oil.
"To make him a slipper makes it harder for defenders to grab him, and that way we can prevent further injuries."
Traoré's shoulder first fell off the team when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
Reports from the Prince of Harry England: A friend of the Duke of Sussex protests claims in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
In conversation with Sky News, Stott said that the contents of the book on Prince Harry and the book on Prince Meghan Markle were in no way different from those of the gossip magazines, the only difference was that the book was bound.
The ex - soldier wants the sea to be increasingly focused on the positive things that his wife and her husband have done, such as their charitable work.
Stott said: “I don’t think what’s going on there is anything different from what we read in the gossip magazines except now in a book. ”
"There's a storyteller who tells us, but there's nothing sure about it coming from them."
"I think it's just another attack on them, just like the gossipers who persecute them."
“I realize that they’re in the spotlight and people want to know what they’re doing, but I wanted them to be more concerned about all the good they’ve done and their charity rather than their personal concerns.”
"Of course, they never get away from it, because of their position."
The support of the duke and duke Sussex overshadowed the other members of the royal family, as noted by a specialist in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had failed to take advantage of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
She added that the rule of authority within the king’s family was established, but it was not possible to direct the public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that all they did to support the queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They're extremely popular."
"They had less weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding."
“But while Harry and Meghan’s wedding was smaller than Vilhilmi and Katrina’s, the news of it was as much, because of the great interest of the world in the couple.”
Donald Trump admits that he often cares for his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often sees his contributions to a Twitter that promotes war.
In an interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his casual replay of Twitter entries – some of which have contained material from white racism – was most difficult for him.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he was looking for his entries, Trump replied: “Often, too often.
It was like this in the old days, before this came, that you wrote letters and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how glad I am that I don't send it," right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out right away, we feel great, and then you start having calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you'll find out a lot.
In the last month, Trump caused a lot of anger after having reclaimed a share (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power" or "White Power".
And in 2017, Trump restored three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the britain First Right Party.
The president told Portnoy that the rebirth that had caused him the most trouble
Trump said: “One sees something that looks good and doesn’t examine it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on the helmet, which is tiny and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found out that there’s almost always the rediscovery that gets you into trouble. ”
The president often argues with his own self, his opponents, and his conspiracy with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him get through the so - called “false stories ” of television programs and newspapers, which he says is untrue.
However, the president’s lies have often come under the microscope, and now Twitter’s entries are a misrepresentation of Trump.
The GPS system may be insecure
Many countries are working to develop location technology other than the GPS system.
Projector says there might be a reason to worry about the safety of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewing life days.
The GPS will follow us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, at landmarks, in industry, and leisure time.
Most people do not think that it is a military device in the U.S. Army’s possession, which opened it first before its general use in the 1980 ’ s.
The GPS technology uses satellite coordinates to a height of 20,000 kilometres above the ground, and therefore conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs," says Mr. E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at the University of Iceland, and expert on risk management and security communication.
He also says that it is easy to send an error label with the wrong location, for example, in warfare.
“GPS system is owned by the U.S. Defence Agency.
They have assured the public that the system exists at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very curious president to have it done, then he could probably do it," says Sämundur.
Thus, many countries are considering other systems and local technology.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite system, and the European Union is driving Galileo off the rails.
“Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have been more accurate and naturally governed by the European Union.
Then it is not one government that manages it completely but many," says Sämundur.
But a lot of people are also looking back at the old Loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the '60s until GPS technology took over.
The Loran signs are sent on very long waves from sent down on the ground.
“ It’s a new version of the Loran system, called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system of warnings, because it makes it a bit different to interfere with it, it’s much more difficult than disrupting the satellite system,” says Sämundur.
However, it is probably safest to have access to most local systems.
Senator Vern Buchanan, an experienced member of Congress who died because of the Crown Virus
"Gary was a skilled man in the fingertips and a loyal servant of the public," said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many lives and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the joy that he had in helping others."
The Buchanan office published a statement in the preceding month, stating that Tibbetts had had no recent dealings with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 411,200 cases in New York City, according to the national health authorities.
The health authorities’ data show that hospitalisations have increased by 79% from the U.S. National Day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerance on Saturday.
“ We were told that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
"At the same time, police work and countering this could have an adverse effect."
Fly from Hornafärd to Cape Town
A turtledove, rosestar, ring doves, crossnails, glares, and tears are among the birds that have been intertwined here in the summer.
On the website of the Birds of South East Africa, brief news about the contagion, where they have been seen and sometimes their sexes can be seen almost every day.
They're a lot of birds' interests in Iceland.
To this end, you can mention the number of people who like the Facebook page Icelandic bird species.
The number of members of the group is about 14,600.
There, pictures of birds are shared, and it is obvious that Iceland is ruled by good photographers who have the patience needed to produce birds.
Brynjulf Brynjulfsson is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is a member of the Birding Observatory of South East and South East Nature Center, and is closely monitoring bird life in that area.
He speaks nicely of these animals that enrich life in Iceland and play an important role there, and it does not matter if the bird is a large, large predator or a small sparrow.
In 2005, the Birds Control Centre was founded on the birthday of Halfdán Björnsson of the Quaestors in Öráum, with a view to airborne and to the significance of natural research that he carried out from 1940 onward.
“ Halfhead was 13 years old when he began to learn about birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the Kjarn.
"We at the birdwatching centre are not doing exactly the same thing that Halfdan did but are building on his data by counting and marking birds."
Half the land was a farmer and a universal scientist, born March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, nearly nineteen years old.
His half - dead brothers and sisters in the Quaestors aroused the interest of many who came to know them about Icelandic nature.
In this group is Björn Gísli Arnarson, “the employee” of the Bird - Minding Center.
Bear grew up in Reynar fields in the South Bank and was given a rich natural splendour by his neighbor, Halfdan, of the Quaker.
But what exactly is the bird - tailed observation center in southeastern Germany doing?
About March 20 each year, a special bird’s nest is set up in the Unicorn Gardening, a wooden dose within the Hornfärd port.
There are standard markings for the birds that come online.
The Internet is being downloaded around May 10, when the time of lay begins.
The Internet is up all day, at least from about 6: 00 a.m. to 7: 00 p.m.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in it are marked, measured, and then released into freedom again.
Every hour, a journalist asks the apocalypse.
“ Yes, we share it with us, me and Bizz.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, this can be a lot of puzzles, but somehow we can do this," says Brynjulf.
The networks are then reestablished during the period from August 1 to November 10 — every day that the weather allows.
Between guarding the nets and the periods they do not have, Brynjulf and Björn are marking the crowns, clouds, and various moths where they reach them.
In addition, they take on various special projects.
One of these projects is being carried out in collaboration with the Institute of Natural History of Iceland and is about collecting forest roots from birds.
“ The forest mite leaps onto the birds at their winter stations and then takes them to a land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, so these ticks are not big when they arrive in Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But enough about tickles.
Asked how the birds in southeastern Germany did it this summer, Brynjulfur says that the cricket’s throw seems to be going well — over the head.
“ The crown’s supply here is at Hala, South Bank, where everything is going well.
But there is nothing more to be found at Jakulsárlon, where, a few years ago, there was a huge litter."
He says that a few years ago, over a thousand pints were thrown there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“ When we look at moths and weeds, I feel that it has diminished in the last few years what you feel about them.
But of course, there is always a change between years."
What can explain the great change is probably about food supplies, according to Brynjulf.
"This is all about food."
Then humans can also have their works to say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to have a good time in southeastern Austria this summer.
"One of the things that I think are positive about is the increase in numbers after a great deal of depression," says Brynjulf, "but during the last years and decades the clouds have been falling dramatically."
Of sparrows, it is reported that the maroon seems to be going well in its nest in summer, as it did last year.
The forest ostrich and dutch tits had dropped somewhat, but Brynjulfur says it doesn't show up until in the fall how this summer proved to be them.
But let's turn to the constables.
Often they attract great attention, especially if they are very few and even colorful.
These two interesting features have one of the most popular features of the summer: the Rosary.
"Otherwise, it's been relatively quiet in the summer in the confluences," says Brynjulf, who says that in the countryside there are now a cryogenic and ring pigeons have been seen and are beginning to appear here.
When Brynjulf and Björn get to the brink, they also mark them, as do other birds.
Marks are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
The meanings, such as what the winter stations of the birds are, where they hide and what their journeys are, can be found.
"It's even possible to see how long they're on a flight," says Brynjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, to form when epidemics such as avian detonators occur.
"The knowledge is always being increased."
If someone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by the Bird Survey Centre of South East Germany, the information is sent to the Institute of Natural History of Iceland.
“We have been restored from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One cry from us was later found in the United States."
One bird is a Brynjulf, especially the thought, and it's the foam.
“ The foam is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the Bird’s Thought Centre and the Nature Center of South East Africa are tasked with watching his birth — which has become quite sluggish, and now he is on the wailing list.
It is difficult to claim what has caused a crash in the stock, but one theory is that the foam has made a seaport that was previously discarded by fishing boats and is in good sea condition than is now much more effective and has an impact on the foam.
Are you at the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ Of course, you don’t make me say no, ” says Brynjulf laughing, adding, “where we’re also chasing interfering birds, we probably need to go far. ”
But certainly the South East is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is drawn into the country from Europe, and then birds are scattered from here.
Looking at birds and migratory birds is very interesting, but it is less found here than elsewhere in the country.
It's not far from ferrets and to boulders, so that the area which such things are suitable for bird inspection."
But on Brynjolf's favorite bird?
He thinks about it for a short time before he answers.
Is the question difficult?
“ A nest is my bird, ” he concludes, “I have found nine of the ten that have been seen on the land. ”
“ I now find it most enjoyable to take pictures of the horoscopes.
So it's always nice to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But that is what both of them have done to Binni and Bjössi.
If you would like to monitor the work of Binna and Bjössa at the Fuglatskunkningstation South Eastland, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the Birds website.is
Saudi Arabia — The Sun’s Beach of the Future? No Alcohol or Bikini
The travel industry has grown enormously in many parts of the world in recent years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
The authorities of the land account for some $60,000 billion (U.S.) to create a paradise for tourists in the land.
The Guardian's reporting.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that the Icelandic people are supposed to be used in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunk in bikinium.
How, then, should tourists be drawn to this strenuous Islamic land?
For example, this should be done by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made by men), drone trucks, and robots serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be recovered in the oil spill of the land.
The crown prince says that there is no discussion about women’s being able to avoid covering shoulders and knees in public places but admits that creating a travel paradise in the country is not a simple matter, since it is too hot when the sun is high in the air and cannot be trusted in the air.
However, it may also be considered whether it does not diminish the interest of prospective travelers if they are unable to buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, a former president of the Central African Republic, announces presidential proposals
On Saturday, the former President of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been cast out of the chair, announced that he would volunteer for the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations imposing sanctions and the issuing of a warrant for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his commission in a speech before a large group of supporters at his assembly, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in Bangui, the capital.
In 2013, this 73 - year - old general and general was removed from the League in the rebellion of the greatest Muslim rebels from the north, who plunged the majority of the nation into Christianity, into a violent civil war and a serious and long - lasting human crisis.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech criticised at the current president's office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize was first elected after a coup in 2003 and held a presidential office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for encouraging genocide, but it has not been arrested since he returned from exile in the late past year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or international sanctions affect his performance.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to abolish the sanctions imposed in 2014 due to alleged support for the armed anti-balaka Christian groups.
Touadera is currently directing the country with the support of the extensive peacekeeping services of the United Nations, which account for more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for a second term, but his offers have not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace agreement with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend their interests in a particular community or religion.
Since then, violent crimes have been reduced, but there are still bloody incidents that are most often caused by conflicts of resources, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the authority of the government.
More than 1.5 million people have been consumed by violence to flee their homes.
The situation of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is "indecent for everyone", says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, the centerman of Real Madrid, says that the position of the Spanish team's Gareth Bale is 'incomprehensible for everyone'.
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team, and he did not participate in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now this summer, it is up to the player to stay still and let his contract run out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear.
"There is no way to avoid the situation becoming unsatisfyable for everyone," said Kroos on the radio Lauschangprüf Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He wasn’t bought to play as little as he really is.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said 'yes' but so said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry because of that.
When asked if the situation would have had a negative effect on Real’s atmosphere, Croos said: “Not as much as you expect.
I've known him for six years, and we've been working things very important together."
Chinese give Reykjanestown 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the Koronus virus
Mr. Chinaman Jin Zhijian delivered two thousand face masks a week ago to Mayor Reykjanes.
This was the occasion for the mayor’s visit to the Chinese embassy on July 22, last.
News of the wise men first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to repay the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanestown, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
According to Víkur, there has been talk of promoting friendly prayer cooperation between the town of Reykjavik and Xianyang city, but the communities began their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is based on this friendly town collaboration, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the struggle against the Korean virus epidemic.
Says a news report that the masks will be used in sensitive institutions and centers of the city of Reykjavik for both employees and other visitors who come there.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the accompanying picture shows the inscription on the face mask, which says “Beer is each behind, except for his brother.”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculate by reducing pay
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland's master KR, next month and says he's interested in the Danish First Division.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland's champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old visitor claims to miss Danmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jacob’s daughter.
Danan’s contract with KR is at the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish society would have to negotiate with KR about the purchase price to get him in August before the start of a new season in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until this winter to get to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish department will start again at the end of August.
This means, of course, that I would have to cancel my contract with KR-inga but I have told them I miss Danmarka, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with Coach Rúnar Kristinsson, who had shown full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said that the price of the purchase would not be much of a problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two first partners after the division was about to end and the past knew where they would end.
There has already been some interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic branch stops," said Thomsen, adding that it was clear that there were not many partners in Denmark who could buy his contract with KR.
“ It’s not quite clear right now, but it’s been interesting.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and who comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and said looking first and foremost at the Port of Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-inga doesn't have to worry because he didn't give himself all the exercises and games, even though he missed Danmarks.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do things 100 percent.
I can quite cheat on the fact that I miss Danmarks when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says clearly that he will reduce his salary by leaving Iceland's Masters in the next division of Denmark.
“ I’ll probably have to lower my salary just because of the crown virus crisis, which seems to have affected Danish societies just more than the Icelandic ones.
But I'm also in school, and one solution might be that a company got me a job.
Yes, most of the 1st - division societies agree with sponsors.
I'm learning sports management through the Player's Association and I'm finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the beginning of KR in two games in Pepsi Max in this season, but has been in history in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games last year and scored seven bounds.
KR is equal to the choice points on top of Pepsi Max as well as on the game for good, but the team will meet KA on Akureyri today.
Reaching the crown virus on board a bus while the driver gets into a hot argument about face masks
The video shows passengers and drivers aboard the Arriva Straße in Liverpool, who are fighting for mask use.
The driver of the car is told to a woman that it is not in his business to tell passengers to wear a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not in my business to tell everyone in the car to wear a mask. ”
Witness said of the incident: “A man and an older woman began to give to her, and much argument broke out. ”
“The driver had to leave his seat and come to ask what was going on and he told one woman that she wasn’t even using the mask right. ”
"A woman then pulled off the wagon and said she was going to report the incident."
Arriva’s spokesman said: “The security of our customers and our employees is our first priority.
"Our clients are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptions apply)."
"Provides information and indications for customers on this and all other distance rules are on board on the bus, on the social media and on our websites."
Since June 15, there has been a commitment to a mask in public relations.
More than 16.3 cases of COWID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the crown virus worldwide.
Most of the cases of COWID-19 have been reported in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to recruit people with disabilities more often
The actress is taking part in a new fight for increased participation in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is under way at the same time as 30 years have passed since the setting of American laws on disability rights, which will take place on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer talks about the importance of people seeing themselves and their lives reflected in the real world on the screen.
"Nothing can replace personal experience and true publications," she says.
"That's why it's so important to hire appropriate actors in the appropriate role."
Spencer discussed the effect she had on seeing black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the part "Good Times".
In 1974 to 1979, the CBS scenes were prepared by Norman Lear, and they ran the road as the first jokes that showed two parents both of African origins.
Association against hunger pushes Yoho aside after an event in the Senate
WASHINGTON (AP) — Regardless of a Christian organization that wants to put an end to hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Senator Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organizations, and that he had become so, after what they called “attack” at Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, New York Senator of Democracies, accused Yoho, the Republican Congressman of Florida, of using a melancholy and masculine harsh words when he rebuked her when they met the steps of the Senate's last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed that the incident confirmed that the expression was as it described it.
Bread for the World stated in a statement that the organization’s government had met Yoho on Friday and was seeking to say that he was saying, “To correct our commitment to supporting women and black people, the interior and the world wide, who are leading us toward the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
The Bread for the World Web site says that their “joint Christian voice ” exerts pressure on the assembly and government to end hunger in the land and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is an independent Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty with reliable public policies, the organization maintains the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we are dealing with people in positions of power, wherever it is on the political spectrum, ” says the statement.
“In our opinion, recent actions and words by Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements of our governing staff. ”
At the time of the story, Yoho’s spokesman had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the House last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez spoke dramaticly about the incident and directed her words against what she called a male band as "accepting violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her associates agreed that the incident was an example of far too common behavior of men.
Yoho described the event as a brief discussion of policy and that “no one was troubled, harassed, or attacked. ”
He said that he regrets having shown “a good - for - nothing attitude. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a progressive senator and has received both praise and praise for her cleanness.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservative Congressors and will sit in the holy stone after his fourth season.
Wait until 98 minutes in the locality to score the first goal of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or laid off in the English prime department during this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final tour of the department.
Lingard had not graduated from the English Selection Department since he twice scored against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in today as a reserve for Manchester United when Leicester was able to play for the championship.
When more than seven minutes were over the normal playing time, the Lingard hit the ball off the Kasper Schmeimchel goaler Leicester and scored the goal.
Jesse Lingard's long-awaited target.
Real Madrid players exempt from the rules of appeal
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, in the Meisterstadil Europa, without having to go to two weeks of disease.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain need to travel to two weeks of pyrexia to prevent the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of a race team, in the highest level of sports.
This confirmed the council's commitment to sports with Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that those who ignore the rules will only be in isolated areas, at closed doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical staff, and media.
Thus, on August 7th, Madriders can meet Manchester City without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2–1 below the duel after losing Santiago Bernabeu on February 26th.
The victory will continue in the 8-way outcome that will take place in Portugal.
Precipitation and Precipitation of the Land of the Merchant
It is clear from reports of overcrowded hotels and tents to judge, in the least south, that Iceland has been able to travel inland this summer.
Have those who have laid their feet down also been fortunately with weather and weather conditions DV in one case that the summer has been simply declared beautiful, so far at least.
But now it is time for a merchant’s weekend, which has been the largest holiday weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how this year will be, compared with other weekends, but it is now the case that events that have been held in the ordinary year have attracted a great many people.
It is enough to mention a national festival, for example.
The weather, of course, will play a big role, but now is the appearance of a rainstorm all over the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weather room predicts a rainstorm from Thursday evening to the least until Saturday evening.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth in the north Atlantic Ocean, and they are likely to change.
The weather scientist Einar Svenbjörnsson, in his prophecy on his weather web, Bika, says that the storehouse weekend is expected to be subdued.
He says: Medical draughts in the atmosphere with a part of the cold, which too often reaches the surface, lead to the fact that when warm air from the southwest tries to get closer, only low winds and vents form.
Of course, there is also a warm air that is “floating ” in the north.
In support of his predictions, one of them says: “A small wave from America goes east and with it a summer sky.
As she approaches, she “produces ” in the form of a drop in air pressure and a significant summer drop. ”
The big prediction, the European calculator on the left of the map, and the American JRC predictions on the right are quite consistent with this trend.
The divorce of the lowlands is due to the prediction of late Thursday and early Friday with sharp A-ight and rain on most of the land.
The medication center of about 985 hPa is followed by the following.
This time, there's some warm air on Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it could blow up together.
You suffered a serious injury when a cattle car crashed in Wexford
You were seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck turned to the bridge and rolled into a manless quiet car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered a serious injury in the accident, which occurred about 1: 50 a.m. today.
He was brought to the hospital in Wexford, where he is under heavy control.
The police department is investigating the scene and the bridge has been closed and bypassed.
The number of cattle was killed in the conflict.
The police urge all those traveling along the road from 13:45 to 14:00, as well as others in the area who might have witnessed the incident, to contact the Wexford Police Station at 053,916,5200, police telephone at 1800,666,111, or other police station.
Tracked a actress from Law and Order all the way to New York.
"I was shot in her like you get a youth shot like that," says Birna Hörn Björn's daughter about Marisku Hargitay, the leading player of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so rocked by the actress that she came to the scene and waited for her for hours together, just to say hi.
When Birna Hronn Björnsdóttir, owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Office, watched as many Icelanders watched Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the ages, she collided with Mariska Hargitay’s main actress.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actress in the play Love Stories on Rás 1.
When Birna was a teenager herself, at the age of many who are beginning to develop violent love shots, she did not experience it as she did her peers, for she stood in a hurry to suppress her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boys ’ bands and young magical heartcrackers from movies, but she did not have them at all.
“ I was cutting pop leaves and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it; it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes people are told that when people get out of the closet, they go through a late-night loop.
“ We spend our teens suppressing these teenage motives, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot at her."
A few years ago, when she was in New York City, the actress ran on her tail.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in the city, and receiving Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Gudjón, to assist with the shooting.
“ We were working for 30 people and spending a wonderful time with strangers.
This is of course a warm atmosphere when you spend so long together a day so that it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Marisca.
One woman in the shooting team says his friend is familiar with the actress because he was in the recording team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like to work with the actress and if Birna can get to see her.
"She tells me to stop it, she doesn't know if she can let it happen," says Birna.
Finally, when the movie is over, Birna tries to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
"She had already had a few glasses and said she would just make it up."
A few days later, Birna sends the woman a message asking if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she wakes up on a long - awaited message.
“ I watch the phone and scream over me.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up by the scream and I say, I have to shower and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and filming team Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but that’s the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, ” says the message, and Birna clothes herself in a hurry, asking where they’re taking the lift and taking it up to 45th floor, where the group is assembled.
Birna comes up and waits for a woman in the work force to come to her and ask this uninvited woman if she can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and I asked his wife to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here."
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna with wonder and asks how on earth she came all the way to the plant and was supposed to be a strict security guard.
Birna explains that she has now just taken the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend and Birna.
Next to it, an extra player sits in the games, and they start chatting.
"I say to him, 'I am a fan, but you,' says Birna.
"I played it like this was the most normal thing in the world."
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The actors appear regularly when pause is taken, they get a snack, and Birna looks around and looks for Mariska, which is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he's going, unfortunately.
Birna asked him to put himself in the hands of another employee, and she did not think that she would go anywhere right away.
Surprisingly, the friend accepts it and reaches out to another employee.
"He comes with his second friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to meet Mariska."
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes to Birna running.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry!
These are unusual situations today, there are reporters with her so she won't stop.
She's going straight to a car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and lose my face" Birna veins off and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about 40 wheelbarrows, some marked and some not.
Mariska’s trailer, on the other hand, does not find it, and it is desperate to be choked.
“ I feel the breakdown pours on me because I had spent half a day in this but then think well, I tried.
That was fun."
Evil keeps Birna back to the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera team looks at her with pity, and it is clear that Birna was unable to do her mission.
Birds accept fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under cover to cover for the rain.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay stood there in the pantsuit she wore in the parts, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move with emotion.
“ I look at my body and my hands, and now I think you must move.
Now you must go towards her."
Birna does it and remembers to pick up her shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello and say hello," runs Birna.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further because Mariska’s car is here and it is whistled at.
Turning to Birna, Mariska says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
She says goodbye to the idol, watches the car drive away and then breaks up.
“ I phoned Erling and Gunna, and they thought it couldn’t be done.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I'll say, "Yes, I'll meet her, you'll have to see me now."
Then we toasted in soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She does not regret anything if she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It’s like once in a lifetime, sacrificing such time and energy to make things happen.
But I'll always be a fan of that woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Horn Björnsdóttir in the play Love Story on Rás 1.
Police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to be concerned that the crown virus can be carried by the police on alcoholic beverages.
This is said by a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area during a conversation with mbl.is.
There have been indications from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police get involved, get on the road, and let anyone on the road.
However, the police say that cleanness is full.
“It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend a cup that people blow in, ” says a policeman.
“Some people want to put their lips to this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, a few inches away. ”
Asking if it's enough distance, a policeman says so.
If there is positive evidence, the police use it at a different level.
He has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal distension: among other things, anise can be introduced to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not a coincidence.
People suffering from bowel inflammation, which is a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, dyspepsia, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening symptoms according to the ADAA.
"This is because the colon is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress," explains ADAA.
If the temperature does not decrease, food intolerance may occur.
Judge tries to stop a decision that children will be released from the hands of the immigration authorities
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected time limit by saying that the U.S. government of immigration and tax authorities do not have to release children if it cannot be done with any of the three ways described in its previous decree.
However, Gee also stressed this in his decree that the immigration and tax authorities were obliged to release the children without undue delay.
The three routes given to Gee are to release families held by immigration and customs authorities, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families to a federal court.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of the Institute Proyecto Dilley, who gives families legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it into the hands of immigration and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
"The most important thing is that children are kept in prison untimely and they will not let out unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to it or families agree to be broken," said Fluharty.
Three locations are held in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley), and Carnes, Texas.
The children of these places are from 1 to 17 years of age, according to lawyers and representatives who provide legal assistance.
In June, in charge of the Flores Convention on Child Care, Gee said that ‘where the rules on masking and social exclusion are not or are not followed badly’, it is urgent to move children from these stations.
969 people in custody of the immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the crown virus and are in isolation or surveillance from July 23, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, there are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the maintenance center for families.
A total of more than 3700 cases have been confirmed in custody
Will examine legislation on the independence of directors
The prime minister does not say that life - style funds set a benchmark in their investment policy for the rights of workers.
Commenting on the need to ensure the independence of directors of bioeconomy funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
After Iceland’s airline company closed negotiations and announced to all airlines, the VR government declared that the directors appointed by VR in the management of the Lifeyrisskat of merchants were in favour of or voted against the participation of the Bioemissions Board in the upcoming Icelandic partial bid.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of VR, went on to say that governments would be replaced if they failed to do so.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later, as did VR.
On Friday’s news of RUV’s news, Ásgeir Jónsson, the bank manager, said to ensure the independence of directors of the bioeconomy funds in the approved funds and possible legal changes.
The prime minister, Katrin Jacobs daughter, says that governments are independent, but it is already considered by law to be secure.
“ Of course, the Bank Manager, who is carrying out this financial supervision, has said that it needs to look specifically at the rules surrounding this independence, if something needs to be looked at there, ” she says.
Katrin says that according to laws, life - money funds have a moral standard in their investment policy.
It is desirable to consider the social and moral standards that they want to emphasize in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual, too, that life - market funds also set a benchmark in their investment policy for the rights of employees.
But I naturally believe that such decisions are taken through policy making but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
"Unbearable traffic jams at the Eleven Year's Bridge," says the President of the City of Årborg
Heilig S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg, says a traffic jam, which is formed by the Eleven Year Bridge on Selfossi every day completely intolerable.
He hopes to send out new bridges over the river Euphrates in the fall.
Now that the Icelandic people are traveling through their land and there is a great deal of traffic on the national highways, daily traffic congestion on the Elf’s Bridge is created when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the community.
Long lines form at the bridge and can take the patience of drivers to wait in a row.
“ Yes, it’s totally unbearable, it’s one traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s only been in the days.
There are many bitters, sometimes quite on Hellisheði for those who want to get by on their way east to land and those who are coming westward, so that it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday at all," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the town government in Árborg.
Helgi says that the local authorities in the city of Árborg recently had a meeting with the director of the Vega factory and the designer of the Vega factory, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s been working on these things, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being offered in the fall.”
But is there any counsel for those who are in wait at the river Euphrates all the days of the summer?
"Yes, you can go through the narrow and through the Eyrarbakka; it is hurrying, but those who are going to the east, you can't tell them to go to Lyngdalsheið, but those who are going to the uprisings should use Mosfellsheiðiði, Diligence and Lyngdalsheiði".
Heilig S. Haraldsson, president of the City of Årborg, who says the traffic jam, which is formed by the Eleven Year Bridge at Selfoss inlerably.
Every day longtime petitions develop at the Alfonso Bridge and often require drivers to wait for considerable time to cross the bridge.
Then the only advice is to take a deep breath and think something positive.
The future of the native coal spheres in northern Brisbane takes place before organizational judgment
The city government said that in addition to the area’s vital home to the koala bears, swags, and gray geese, it would be an important link between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek natural areas.
The complainants have challenged the rejection of the City Government to the Administrative and Environmental Court, arguing that the structure is in accordance with the law on civil society since 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been met and would "be done without unacceptable effects".
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the surrounding environment.
The manufacturers argue that even though the proposal is fully in line with the organization, it could be modified if it does not meet requirements rather than reject them.
As is the case, the project involves a number of stages, including a service station, child care, and 39 residential homes.
Public submissions were more than 120 at the same time, and most objected to the proposal because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The minority leader of the Brisbane City Government said that the city needed to buy the land to protect the koala bear.
"[Chief Mayor] Adrian Schrinner needs to stop wasting taxpayers' money in a fight with the promoters for judgment and buying this country to protect the nature and wildlife of Brisbane," said Mayor Cassidy.
"This is one of the most important habitats in the Mountain to Mangroves natural environment and there are a number of koala bears."
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted to return the koala bears in the area to be protected.
"We felt the proposal was not suitable for the area," Schrinner said.
“I understand that this is going through the judicial system, and we clearly hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will ensure that the home is preserved.”
Schrinner said that mapping the home koala bears is a shared responsibility for city government and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the home koala bears that local authorities support when they apply for projects for treatment.
Sunscreen: Next step is to win something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Udd, was hoping that the team had secured a third seat in the English department today.
The team will therefore play in the Championship of Europe in the next period.
The United needed equal or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2–0 victory of the Red Devil.
“A great achievement for the players in reaching third place in terms of the situation during the period.
I think that we boys could have overcome a spiritual gap by playing such a big game, since we have lost twice during that period.
We knew we needed a final decision today, now we can start the next chapter that is with these boys to win title," said Solskjærer triumphant.
Manchester United still has the chance to win a title during this period, but the European Parliament has played its part in August, and is almost in the 8-year phase.
A cease-fire begins at midnight in Eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and forces of resistance in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete” ceasefire to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of resistance told them that they had ordered their soldiers to cease arms and issued a decree prohibiting the use of weapons.
Ukrainian army said its army has "be prepared" for the ceasefire.
If this were to be achieved, it would “make the way for the implementation of other rules” of the Minsk Peace Agreement, according to the statement of President Ukraine’s office earlier this week, where the arms break was called a time-out requirement.
The goal of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was launched in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separate parties benefiting from Russia, which began in 2014 following the invasion of Russia in the Crimea and the support of the country in the context of the separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting.
On Sunday, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed concern about Kiev's appeal for the Minks agreement to be reviewed and said that the position of President Volodymir Selensky, Ukraine, on 'the immutability of the Minsk Agreement, which he again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action'.
Selensky, however, stressed the need to resort to “further action” to free the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in eastern Ukraine, the inmate Crimea and Russia, according to the statement from the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have authority over the border with Russia in the areas of segregation when it has been granted a wide right of self - control and when elections have been held in the regions.
The conflict was reduced, but Ukraine’s army and rebels have continued to be replaced.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support for the Minsk Convention and agreed to start the peace process again.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have power over the borders for the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the agreement be concluded without any change.
The new ceasefire agreement was reached on Wednesday by a three-sided cooperation group appointed by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by the EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blasphemy of Peter’s Square, Pope Francis also mentioned the ceasefire and said that “it would be necessary to rebuild trust and lay the foundation for such a necessary and long-suffering reconciliation with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death at protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death at protests in Texas when he approached the car and the driver in the car launched his weapon, according to the police.
Katrina Ratliff, a police spokeswoman, told the reporters early Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 10:00 at a protest in Austin.
The man was transferred to a hospital where he was later declared dead.
The car had whistled, bent down the road and then speeded the trip toward the Protestants, said the witness Michael Capochiano to Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man with a rifle approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the reporters that the first recorded good news indicates that “the victim could have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to the news agencies, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streamed live on Facebook, where they heard the whistle of the car and a few shots fired.
Markasupupa in the First Victory of Blika in July
A big moment won his first division victory from June 29th, when the IA struck, 5-3, in Pepsi Max Division of Men at the Kopavogsfield tonight.
Skags, on the other hand, lose their third game in a row in the department.
After winning the first three games in the league, five games were played without rejoicing and had been lost three in a row for the game with the I.A. tonight.
So it was working or killing for Blika, who came into the game with great power.
Alexander Helgi Sigurdarson led the team with a fairer arrangement in 11 minutes after Kristen Steindorsson had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead, following an excellent preparation of the hostage son of the Eyjølf on the left.
In the first half of the world, the shady people did not arrive at lands or beaches, where high - pressure locals made them extremely difficult to connect.
When Danin Thomas Mikkelsen scaled in the corner of Högler, the son of Gunnlaug, a third goal, the binoculars had all the power on the field.
Then, just three minutes later, Christ the son of Steindor scored his second goal and the fourth goal of Blika.
However, the history of the first half did not end there.
Skagerrs were given hope for the second time when Trygvi Hrafn Haraldsson cut off hellfire shortly before a break, but Kwame Quee had then broken the Viktori Jonsson within Blik’s pond.
4–1 was therefore the position of the Wide Moment when the half-game gall.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when Skagerrmen again challenged.
At that time, Suvar Jónsson’s hive was alone and unelected on the market in Blik and easily steered the ball into the net after Trygva Hrafn’s son Harald’s horn.
However, only three minutes later, when he broke Alexander Helga, a tyrant became a criminal within a pond of IA.
Vitaspyrna was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored safety in order to cross a Wide Momentum from 5 to 2 when only seven minutes had passed by the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen’s goal, Skagermans recovered.
Anton Ari Einarsson, goalkeeper Blika, hit them under a pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball into Viktor's foot from which the ball was rejected in the net.
Unbelievable 5 - 3 events occurred when less than ten minutes were passed by a second half, resulting in a slowing down of the target.
Despite the fineness of both joints to add to the bounds, including two Kwame Quee death range from the Wide Moment, they did not become more and 5–3 winners of the Wide Moment of the Game.
Then, with the first victory in a ten - month period, from June 29, after the victory of 14th in a third place, two points from the election, which is a seat above and three from the top of the KR.
KR and Valur, however, have both games on Blik.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has ten points in the eighth place, five points from the doom.
The Puppet Corps Not at Risk Despite the White House’s Commentary
Last night, the producers of the Pulp Company decided not to stop showing the child’s material in the near future.
The statement comes from Kayleigh McEnany, the White House’s media representative, that the factors dealing with, among other things, law - enforcement dogs are the victim of "disclosure culture".
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and stated that their fans would have no need to worry about the future of the Pulp Company.
A number of television shows dealing with police work have been released in the United States recently following a protest against police violence.
However, the puppy team is not in this regard, despite its reputation as a community medium.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, Mr. McEnany said that President Trump of the United States was opposed to “nonstop culture, ” and especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to a strong response to social media by individuals or businesses and is called after the person is beheaded for protest.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw to it that shows on the Puppet team, children’s stuff about cops, were stopped.
The same is true with Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy producer Lego took out a law - enforcement set, but there is no foot for that statement, according to defensemen Lego.
However, it is true that the actualities of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the Western Sea show.
Both factors are controversial, among other things, about displaying footage of real police posts without permission from individuals who appear there.
Together for 29 years — Sometimes jealousy and suspicion arise
Christopher Thomas ’ daughter answers questions about family, children, and love questions about family, family, family, and family, family, family, and family, issues.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15, together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but to be together, and we feel good, but both of us have felt like we are missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison as to how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in the matter of whether the other person is looking around, is thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and is changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a bruise that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for your wonderful question and I am so happy that you have so much open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with the relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about it in each corner, couldn't talk about it, and even take some steps that you might later regret.
Everything on tables, isn't it always the best?
Strong self - image has the most predictable future of happiness and the stronger self - image you have, the more likely you are to have a marriage mate with strong self - image.
Because relationships that start in teen years do not last all their lives, people often grow in each direction, but in cases where there is a beneficial effect, individuals can become stronger than many others.
As your relationship begins to develop during your greatest formative years, it can be concluded that you have developed together and have a positive influence on each other’s identity.
We meet up with some of the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn around and think, ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What gives us that many years of speciality?
I allow myself to say that the benefits can be a lot more than the flaws.
You have shaped each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you are individually tailored to one another by one millimetres.
That's more than a lot of people can say.
Worth it?
You talk about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes such as divorce and a new relationship are also accompanied by follow - up fish that you are not necessarily excited about.
You might be missing from starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting families together.
These include new challenges, a different problem, and potentially something new and exciting.
But this isn't just a pink cloud and happiness, no, at your age, this can become a messy task, which may never be as good as you've already done to each other.
Is it worth it?
Would it not also be advisable to put the focus on what you can do to increase tension, inestimability, and new ones in your relationship?
You haven't laid your shoes on the shelf.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What efforts can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not getting?
What can you give to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefinate your relationship.
Would you like to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance to various forms of communication, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multi-loves, or deciding to stop temporarily.
I'm not going to tell you what to do, but no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would lighten this heavy fat that's hanging over you, if you look at this and think about solutions.
What do you need so distrust and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're capable of things together.
Use it as strength and hold hands toward your solution.
We encourage readers to e-mail their questions and traditions to Kristine: hjønabandsseela@gmail.com.

This is war!
Coleen Rooney hired Johnny Depp in the Wagatha Christie rhyme at Rebekah Vardy.
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself from the charges of injury to Rebekah Vardy
After talks between the footballers’ spouses perished, their acquaintances expect dramatic breakdown.
Coleen Rooney has hired the astronomer in Johnny Depp’s alleged injury to defend himself in his so - called “Wagatha Christie” dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday notes that Rooney has assigned David Sherborne to defend herself from the accusations that she had been injured against Vardy, with claims that personal information has been leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
A few days after the report was submitted to the Supreme Court, Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the parishioner Jamie Vardy, Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claims.
The magazine states that the five children, 38 years old, “have given birth to severe panic attacks and anxiety, so that she was afraid of going out of the house” and that Vardy, who was then seven months on the way,“ had been hospitalized three times... because of the anxiety caused by the transfer and its consequences”.
In addition to being Depp’s lawyer in his injury against The Sun, because of claims that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the case of the duke and duke of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After the conflict between the two football clubs failed, those who are familiar with a dramatic breakdown in the courtroom would expect.
“If you felt that the Depp court was a play of sight, do not underestimate the forthcoming war of football interests,” said one source.
"Now this is a real war, Coleen leaves nothing, and neither does Becky, and it's gonna be emotional."
Coleen Rooney argued that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked some fictional stories about her into a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after revealing how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see her Instagram stories until only Vardy's account remained.
Coleen says they've put a hot story on Instagram, which would have appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s report, which refuses to participate in the case, she claims that after Rooney published the accusations, she was making a flowering cup, with a view to causing much harm and immense suffering.
Coleen’s lawyers have questioned these words, saying that statements about her suffering are presented only to the media and draw attention to the facts.
One source said: “The documents from Becky are misleading. This is all a fabrication. ”
There's Lawyer Paul Lunt at the Brabner law firm in Liverpool, which speaks for Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with former England master Wayne Rooney.
Vardy, a law firm at Kingsley Napley, London, is not sure if she's hired a lawyer yet.

Biden's cooperative denies "Fox News Sunday" for one week after Chris Wallace interview with Trump
During Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump of the United States doubted that a prospective president of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would be able to handle the death of Wallace’s fall on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s election team had told Fox News that he was “not free ” for an interview.
“ In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent, Joe Biden, would thrive in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
"In the week, Biden's election team asked for an interview and they said that the former vice president was not available."
“ We keep asking each week, ” he added.
Trump’s coronation team has critically criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and a press conference during interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to elevate the vice president of the past for “hidden ” in their Delaware home.
Biden’s loyalty to public events, however, has not been marred by his offer, since the latest studies show that Biden has a good advantage for Trump in both national and major battles.
Real Clear Politicians mean that the president was under 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four kingdoms in 2016 when he turned them over to the Republican League when he won the White House battle.
In the latest Fox News Poll survey, Biden is with a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, out of checkpoint in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona, three other important fighters in these elections.
And studies indicate that a state that was once a strong stronghold of the Republicans, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in the White House during a second term are often a vote for the president — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the battle between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crowning iron and steel industry, which is under threat from the epidemic — and the performance and history of the President in both parties.
Kanye West and His Struggle at Psychosis
Today, musician Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian, for what he had done.
The head of the mental - health team thinks that he is mentally seeking his creative power, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take medicines to control the disease.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the most original and most influential musicians of the time, but is no less famous as the husband of the real world star Kim Kardashian.
Much of his personal life has been done openly.
Earlier this month, when he announced that he was in a position to offer himself to the president of the United States, he gave an emotional and disfellowshiped speech.
Later, some strange talk appeared on Twitter, claiming, among other things, that his wife was trying to put him in the hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram, asking people to show understanding to their husband and family; he had psychosis, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want help himself.
He has since apologized publicly to her.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people get psychosis.
Ferdinand Jónsson, a head physician in London hospital, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much shock to individuals and especially to their families and loved ones.
This mania can destroy relationships and work and cause immense sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because it's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
Unnsteinsson, chairman of Gehivelpar, has personally struggled with psychosis — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very powerful imagination.
If we are four strands of earthy double bass, he is a hundred strands of heavenly harp.
And he is so superlatively creative, superlatively powerful, and clever in his powerful connection thought, because one is about this connection thought that we who have been given to try to get so familiar in a manly state."
Canye West doesn't want to take psychotic drugs, for he thinks they're subtracting his creativity.
He's been discussing the manic episodes, including the Ye album.
He says it is his choice not to take medication.
“ Many people feel that this creative element, which involves this unconventional thought of connection and the superfluous creative force of the fire that he has, is the natural flaws of often great suffering, as well as the ages and darkness of cellars and darkness. ”
However, Ferdinand says it is important that people with bipolar disorder receive treatment.
“ If you have a lot of mania or a lot of mania, you’re not making a wonderful thing, you’re just on your side.
And as when people suffer severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that state," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take a drug?
"Finally," says Ferdinand.
"And especially to work with someone to find the right dosage and this way to balance between helping him most, and destroying him and his abilities and his creative power."

Delhi Metro builds the first pillar in stage 4 of its operation
Delhi Metro reached an important fourth stage when the first pillar was plunged into the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg, which is being deployed, according to employees on Sunday.
The chair was cast in Keshopur and raised between Keshopur and Mukarba Chowk on Saturday night.
“Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step in the fourth phase of the project as the first pillar at this stage of the upgrading of the train system was plunged into the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg,” stated in the DMRC statement.
In spite of the considerable lack of labour force and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to staff, this “great project” was achieved.
The average height of the pillars on this route is 10 meters.
However, at the foot of Madhuban Chowk, the pillars will be 20 metres high, where the route will be at 1st and 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route will be at 2nd.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the bridge will be 28 metres above sea level, which is the largest height in the history of Dehli Metro, as stated in the statement.
The highest point of the system is at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridgeway leads 7 to 23.6 metres above sea level.
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are vertical manoeuvrable structures that support the adjacent end of two paths.
They form a vertical human activity that carries up the elevated bridges of the train system.
This platform can be seen on the countless large roads under the Delí railways.
The number of pillars now plays an important role as a landmark for the homes of the Delí area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R K Ahsram Marg is the magnification on the Magenta route and on it will be 22 stops.
21,18 km from the road will be raised and 7.74 km will be underground.
Construction of this section started in December last year.
On July 17th, work began in the underground section of the route when construction of a gate wall at the Krishna Park Extension train station began.
June 24th, the DMRC began to launch a submersible piece of U-carrying that would later be installed in the elevated portion of the route.
At the fourth stage of the project, 61,679 km of the new train station will cover three different routes with 45 stations.
These new parts will offer links between the parts of the rail system that Delhi Metro already operates.
Of these, 22.35 km below ground will be raised, but other parts will be raised.

An ambassador wants a gun, armored car, and a stick vest.
The political commander of the U.S. ambassador here, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, said he wanted to carry a gun to himself today's CBS News report.
CBS began with the news: “Despite being placed in one of the safest kingdoms in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been “annoyed” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
CBS points to 12 diplomas, executives, and former representatives, as well as individuals who are familiar with the case.
Gunter’s conclusion was that they demanded permission from the U.S. Secretary of State to walk around armed in this country.
He should also have asked for an armored car that took him between places in Iceland and a puncture vest.
The U.S. Department of State refused to express whether there was any threat to the security of the ambassador, but the U.S. government representatives said that the ambassador was saying that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Although it would have been advertised in Icelandic papers, CBS says, and if that were the case, it would have been possible to meet the ambassador’s requirements.
CBS reports that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the U.S. Press Office, by its sources in this country, has found that no request has been made to the local government.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as being armed because it would offend the host, Iceland.
The ambassador was rewarded for generously supporting Donald Trump’s election in the 2016 presidential election.
Before that, he was a pathologist in California.
Since joining Mai, Gunter has said that he has built an “unfortunate” work environment in the embassy and has already had seven subordinates, called the Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subordinates, who are also appointed to the Diplomite.
All of them were tested diplomas from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away from the ambassador “because he did not look at his appearance.”
Had he already been preparing for a whole year and learned Icelandic.
The next one only lasted six months.
Afterward, staff was set up and the idea was to let Gunter try as much as he could until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was looking forward to the embassy's mission to the "deeplands" and to have undermined him before the U.S. Department of State in Washington D.C.
Foreign Council officials in D.C. are well aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to take action against the embassy’s impoverishment in light of Gunter’s connection with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter was having trouble following the orders of the Foreign Affairs Council in Washington, and he was said to have refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his employees for more months.
When he said he was going to work from his home in California unless ordered by the Secretary of State himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
& Revert
After finally received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new brother, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their inquiries to the U.S. Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not wish to comment on CBS, nor on DV's request.
Gunter, one of the many political envoys of Trump’s government, has been calling attention to unusual behavior in recent months.
In order to form a hard reaction, Woody Johnson came to the conclusion that he was trying to have the British open championship in a golf course owned by Trump.
At the same time, the ambassador in South Africa has been ordered to have fired his number two and then tried to command her son to work.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are political.
30% were political in Obama’s government, and 32% in George W. Bush’s government.
As a result of Trump's plans to send federal police forces there, the protesters and police in Seattle together
The Seattle police used explosive bombs and pepper sprays on Protestants who set fire to work bicycles at a youth prison on Saturday, following a public rage over the plans of President Donald Trump to send federal police forces into major cities.
Repeated bombings hit the streets of Seattle, Washington State, and smoke came from the place where Protestants had fired bicycles in the construction area at the juvenile prison.
The mutants cut a car deck and broke a window in wheelhouses.
The U.S. police opposed Protestants, some of whom held up umbrellas to protect themselves from the pepper caps that rained over them.
The Seattle Times has reported that 16 have been arrested for suspecting police attacks, for preventing police duties, or for refusing to leave the area.
Poland will report on a European agreement to prevent violence against women
Poland’s right-wing government says that the country will withdraw from the European agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal act in the world that aims to prevent violence against women, while Poland’s Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro describes the text as “damaging” in that he requires schools to teach children about sex from a sociological perspective.
Ziobro said on the weekend that on Monday he would start preparing a formal process for the country to comment on the contract.
"This aspect of the ideology is linked to the efforts to change education in schools and leisure activities, to study, to the attitude and conviction of young people in Poland, on the basis of the conclusion that our opinion is wrong, that biological sex is old-fashioned, and that everything is really about social-cultural sex."
Ziobro believes that the terms of the agreement on education for children and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT component in the discussion on family relationships, because this is a view held by left-wing actors or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws," he said.
On Sunday, the Council of Europe said that Poland was “puzzling” about the agreement.
On Friday, at Warsaw, some 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, were protesting, apart from the offices of the right - wing organizations of Ordo Luris, who supported the country’s declaration of the treaty.
“ We will not be victims, ” they said.
There were also protests in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a machinemaker at the House of Honor, died 81 years ago.
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile campaign that counts, among other things, his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first machine to be taken into the Nascar Hall, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were famed for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname "The Government" for his talent with the screwdriver.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR, and also built machines that secured the Honorary Hall partner Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal and Pete Hamilton’s victory.
“The manager was one of the most advanced mechanics in NASCAR’s history,” said the manager and manager Jim France.
“ He brought the power that helped Petty Enterprises gain his advantages at the sports field.
Even though Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his car on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a major factor in landing Lee Petty in 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup in 1960–64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top 10.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happened under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a good lead for his older brother, who relied on his machines as he walked.
Richard, who was then called the King, won the first championship with the Government in 1964 with the Plymouth-bicycle.
They conquered again in 1967, then two years in the 1970s and 1971s, and reached three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their backs, they share the highest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of NASCAR’s true pioneers and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises in building one of the top teams in NASCAR,” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty’s victory is recorded as 212, it is claimed to be well over 250 wins, if all the machines he built for his competitors are taken.
The boss will be remembered forever as the best machine in NASCAR's history."
Lee Petty died in 2000 and Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife, died in 2014.
He was also the former driver’s cousin, and the media player Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, the leader of the truck race.
“Now that we say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and powerful pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be kept in memory, held up and preserved forever, ” said Kelley.
"We send our deepest sympathy to the Petty family."

Armed forces destroy camps and destroy fighters in Zamfara state
Air raids by the HADARIN DAJI Air Force have destroyed the new camps of the armed forces under the so-called "Dangote" in the Doumborou Forestland in Zamfara State.
Undermining officer John Enenche and defense representative said that the air raid, which also killed a number of fighters, had been carried out following HUMINT data recovery and numerous air traffic control missions to confirm.

Serbia wants to increase military aircraft in increasing tension in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia, will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military aircraft as the tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
The President of the United States and other Western states accused the United States and other Western states of arming neighboring Serbia in NATO, as well as Kosovo, formerly in Serbia.
“Franks, Turks, and Germans take good care of their beloved offspring, ” said Vucic, referring to Cosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over to Kosovo’s security forces a number of armored cars.
On a survey of the Serbian army's tank crew, Vucic said that his people could not compete with NATO's arms exports and that 'for this reason we have come up with ourselves'.
Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military aircraft that could purchase, but the media, according to his government, have publicly requested delivery of 20 attack aircraft from the United States.
It appears that no response was received from Washington at the request of Belgrade and that if it were rejected, it would be likely that an attack aircraft would be purchased by Sukhoi-25 from Russia.
Serbian military neutrality has recently been handed over to a highly developed Russian air - defence system, which has also provided war jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also an allied country of Serbia, has given the state a slump for military use.
U.S. officials have discussed openly to impose sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are transferred to Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO members.
In the West and in the neighbouring countries of Serbia, people are worried about the arms flow of Russia and China in Serbia.
The tension is now increasing in the Balkans, where civil war was waged in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance was interfering with Serbia to halt the bloody operations of Serbia against the Kosovo-Albana segregation in 1999.
Despite formal efforts to join the European Union, Serbia’s populist leadership has strengthened its political and military ties with Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: Risks of this fatal condition may be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain good things could be good for the heart muscle.
And how could this reduce the risk of a heart attack?
Scientists have conducted a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease that lasts over five decades.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
"Succulate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthines, multiphenols and stearic acid, which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, also called high-density fat protein, accumulates “bad” cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart – and transfers them into the liver.
The "bad" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then separated from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
Whether the participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate or other cocoa candy is unclear.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate lower blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Cardiovascular activity refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and removes waste material.
Life-style factors were not identified in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and experience less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on cardiovascular health," she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys with books in a new collection news campaign
“We’ve really listened and it was a key element in the preparation of a project,” said Ronson.
“We do not believe that people want to recycle the books — we believe they will want to have them, but they can recover them from their homes if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new campaign has been in progress long before COWID-19 came into play, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the timing of the new campaign has been "good" because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
The researchers have expressed concern that consumers have become tired of the ever - increasing toy gathering campaigns of the largest supermarkets, but Ronson says that there is no evidence of fatigue yet.
“We haven’t seen anything like it yet, but we keep our eyes open for it all the time,” she said.
“ From week to week, from month to month, we report very much data to ensure that what we leave ourselves feels the same with our customers.
It was Cloes who scraped the track for collecting campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first about my year 2018 was the driving force behind the best quarter-year-old market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed along with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the supermarket to boost its sales, and now, lastly, the environmental promotion of Discovery Garden offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, this time the new collection campaign could have a less impact, as UBS analysts forecast increased sales in Australian supermarkets in the majority of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said customers can expect a more diverse collection campaign in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less common.
“ There are many gathering campaigns around the world that we look at, and we are constantly getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do this to make sure that we make our customers more and more comfortable.”
Five laps around the country this summer.
The photographer and the material producer Jon Ragnar Jónsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less involved in the wandering around Iceland since the plague.
A few years ago, John graduated from business studies at the University of Reykjavík, where he now works on travel and marketing for individuals and companies.
The summer began early at Joni, or in April, when he traveled all over the West Bank and stayed in his car.
For the rest of the year, he's had about five or six laps around the country.
Besides, he's been on countless day trips here and there.
What journey has taken place?
“ For someone like me who is always on the run and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
The weather and the company are all important.
A lot of highlands have recently opened up after they opened up in June.
They always travel uphill because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 large cars up Riverside and from there to Lake Elf."
What's ahead of you this summer?
“ I’m very excited about the next one, but I was completing a diving course with DIVE and now taking diving trips here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding a surfboard to my dot pocket so that I could get more into the sea than before.
I am about to go on a ten - day “solo” trip with everything I need, but it will appear later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise I'll be very high up in the near future, as it's not possible to visit that area all year round."
What place in Iceland is your favorite?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but since I’ve been a part of my life.
Each summer, my family and I settled at the roots of the Broad Marks, and since then I have always been well along in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
What place in Iceland are you recommending a visit?
"I'm going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it's like a mullini in South Africa, a support team in East Africa, Aldeyarfoss in North America, the Red Sea on West Earth, the Snow Sea in Westland, and last but not last but not last...
What Is Indispensable About the Travel?
“I don’t go out on land unless I have the following in the car: Good flashlight, hanger’s room, limpeys, fishing knife, fireplaces, refrigerators, and gingerbread... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Seeking 24 roses afraid of drowning off the island of Malaysia
KOUALA LUMPOUR, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday, the Malaysian authorities said that there were 25 refugees who were afraid of drowning after jumping off a boat from the island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high official at the Malaysian county guard, said that the first information showed that only one of the 25 robbers who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late Saturday and has been detained while the case is being investigated, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim robbers have fled Myanmar for military operations, and many of them live in an overcrowded refugee camp in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of people in Malaysia, who have been frequented as a destination for boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airships were used to search.
He said that the county guard will also alert the seamen in the area and the authorities in the neighboring country of Thailand to assist them in the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
Last month, the authorities in Malaysia arrested 269 raiders in custody and found a body on board a ship suspected of being used to smuggle away from the beaches of Langkawi, who said he had been amused to prevent him from going back to sea.
Malachi’s national guard later said that 269 individuals had been transferred from a larger ship with dozens of people who are thought to have died and that their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malaysia could not accept any more of the Rwandan refugees, who are struggling with economic climate because of the Korean virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 roeers — are registered at the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Aswan residents collect, watch and return cargo of chocolate to Sudan by car
The transport vehicle to Sudan with many tons of chocolate fell on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple on Sunday, at the gateway at the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver died due to a heat stroke.
The villagers flocked to help the driver where he lay and save the goods that had been reared.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, expressed his view that the driver was “a fighter on the way to our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had put on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the cargo truck, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said the villagers have been on the scene from morning till night and saved as much of their cargo as they could.
“ What we thought was most important was saving the driver’s life, protecting the cargo and opening up the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to give the injured driver water and shelter, Bahr said, adding that they wanted only to make sure that he was safe from the village.
There have already been criminals in the Congress, and the Koreans could make them worse.
“The epidemic alone is a call to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty,” says a report prepared from a series of interviews conducted by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organizational development and management.
"But we are also faced with another debt penalty that revolves around the inherited sin of our nation and the racial injustice that has plagued our country from its establishment."
The study examines familiar elements related to the pathetic situation of the assembly: lack of real inter-group relations, a schedule limiting the possibility of communication, excessive integration of power in leadership positions, ever increasing funding requirements, inter-group cooperation decisions, negative influence of the media operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for the congressmen are often pre-elections and at last the silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress will move more to the Internet because of the pandemic in which such a system, which allows elections with the help of a proxy in the D.C. without the Congressmen having to travel to Washington, could still add to the problems that exist.
If the idea of a radioconference reaches its feet, it would be a serious setback for attempts to improve inter-group communication, as the report says.
“ For the sake of the epidemic, the council was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
"But despite the need to do so, such a thing should not be interpreted as virtue."
The document says that the assembly needs “more than no less communication between the congressmen, face to face. ”
They need to get to know each other better, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build a relationship based on trust that can lead to greater understanding and solutions."
The appeal of politeness was particularly true this week, when Ted Yoho, the Republican Congressman of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Senator of Democrats with acts, and his associates in the Republican Party agreed to attack the Republican Congressman Liz Cheney in Wyoming with hostile words.
The Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice president's office. Let Trump hear it from the graces.
The Congresswoman Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing his interest in holding the post office of vice presidents in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the Congressional Group of Blacks was interviewed by BlackPressUSA in direct transmission for the #FIYAH! Live Participant and told of his history, energy and commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and began with the words "You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of a workwoman and janitor in Jacksonville, Florida".
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the General Assembly in the hearings of Donald Trump in the Senate in January.
Regardless of whether or not the Senate is infecting Trump, the record is that he is the fourth accused president.
In an interview with the NPR of his office with Capitol Hill, the former Attorney General of the Congress said: “Was it worth it? It has been worth it every day.”
She added that even though the decision had been disappointing, democrats would have been obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings made it clear that it is contrary to Trump’s execution at Roger Stone’s prison sentence, who was sentenced to lie in front of the council as well as his grace of other criminals who were condemned to a similar crime, saying: “Insanity to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your errors.”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential candidates for Vice Presidents, who also holds Karen Bass Chairman of the CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former Congressor of Georgia, the Congressmen Kamala Harris (Democratics, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democratics, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms Mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice's former ambassadors of the United States and several others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she brought her hand to her mouth as she laughed and felt whispered to the people who were watching the live broadcast, and added, "If you want to call... you can do it for me."
There is no doubt that regardless of the political views of each individual, history books consider this period as the time when American politics and attitudes developed.
This did not go unnoticed by Demings.
She mentioned that the number of women involved in making representations to the vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“It’s exactly these opportunities that I work so hard all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they’re of the wrong sex,” she said.
The Congresswoman undertook to ensure that the Democratic Party National Committee and the Biden Election Board would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many to vote as possible.
"I will call Tom Perez (Chairman of the Democratic Party) and I will put this at the top of my list," said Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the words of former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial saying that the president was preparing to reach himself survived Demings: “To the extent that it may suggest that I have made myself feel sick. ”
“ But who would ever do that other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to get away with breaking laws and ignoring the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he can't stand to lose.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."
Vials on the foot for children
There are snacks for children who want to toast their parents from a young age in bottles that fit the tablecloth in a better time.
No doubt some parents now rejoice — or those parents who have had the opportunity to take their childish nuances with their cartoons.
However, it is not so much the children who are reaching out to their parents because they find it more exciting to see on their feet.
On the modernhouseestials.com page, these discussed glasses were used to store several pieces of gold.
The bottles have a good buttock, a steady foot, and a good temperature - so kids can enjoy soups, whether hot or cold.
Each bottle contains about 150 ml.
Those who want to take a closer look at the glass can visit the website HERE, but the bottles are on offer these days with a small amount of $3,400 crowns of Icelandic.
Alibaba and Jack Ma are going to trial in Gurugram for the dear ex-husband.
Gurugram, July 26th: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to justice in Gurugram after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been fired for protesting written reviews and false reports in the company’s programs.
The case is set out in the Gurugram District Court and Sonia Sheokand, the private court, has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and more than 10 others, asking them to come to justice on July 29, according to the news.
The judge has also requested written answers from the company, according to Reuters.
Parmar, who worked at UC Web’s office in Gurugram until October 2017, is reporting 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages on court records.
“We are committed to the company’s internal market and the well-being of its employees, and its policies are in line with local laws.
We can't talk about the current case," said UC India in a statement.
According to Reuters, "the legal process also contains a list of sensitive words" which contain the password of Hindus and English, such as "the border between India and China" and "the war between China and India" which is claimed in the complaint that UC Web uses to study material on its systems in India.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phones, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
The representative of the New York Fire Department says it's "completely" okay to exclude a white fireman from honorary service.
A representative who deals with the subject of multiplicity at the New York Fire Department says it is “completely” okay to keep a white fireman away from honor so that flagbearers can all be black, according to a new report.
White fireman Daniel McWilliams has referred to racial discrimination after being removed from a group of flagbearers at the memorial Mass in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brother-in-law of black firefighters.
The primary fire department representative in the field of multiplicity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, further defended the decision in the hearing of the New York State Human Rights Division, according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the department who in a historic image are seen lifting the American flag at Ground Zero on the days after the 11th of September.
According to McWilliam's dear friend, the fire department had chosen him to be alone with the flagbearers in honor of the memorial.
Being flagrant at this ceremony was “a great honor and privilege” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN trial.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was denied to participate in the honor of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for as claimed, she had asked that all flagrant men at the Mass be black.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old fireman from New York City – to help in another way."
Among what it claims to have asked him to do is to accompany civilians and set up characteristic firemen away from the mess.
McWilliams claims in his prosecution that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of honor because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has worked for 21 years in the New York Fire Department and who also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams for one of the Vulcan Society's members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame,” as friends and colleagues heard what went between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black witness to the trial, a lawyer named McWilliam, Keith Sullivan, asked her the following: “So asking for everyone to be black in honor is not a difference? ”
"No, it's not," said Love, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask for everyone to be in a black sword, which she said, "Absolutely."
Lover explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person in order to “encourage our speciality and our different origins to create pride, unity and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed a complaint for discrimination based on race in the New York City Fire Department in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, New York City fire department, New York City, and unnamed persons in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam's filed his claim, Wilson's supporters had avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have laid her hands on McWilliams and said, "I've heard of you, they told me you'd behave like this, and now you know who I am."
In the playoffs, Sullivan wrote that it was “poor ” to rule out McWilliam’s honor at the mess and to show that one thing was not true of everyone at the fire department.
“ If you’re a black person and a white person’s difference at work is a reminder, ” said Sullivan.
According to Wilson, for her treatment of McWilliam, she was given a "consultation for one hour" according to the law.
Meanwhile, a white person suffers as a disparagement of a black person, Sullivan wrote.
"The New York Fire Department has created a policy and process designed to please the Vulcan community, which acts in a racial way, excuses their actions and assists them ... and this needs to be stopped," said Sullivan.
Fearing a Walking Wayward and Demanding Money
One was arrested in the city center after a robbery, threatening a pedestrian and trying to recover money from the person.
Man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police reported a man with a knife in the city center.
The knife was confiscated and the report was taken from the person.
More than eighty cases came into the headquarters table from 17 to 05 C.E., and this morning six were in a prison cell.
Among other things, the police stopped the driver of a vehicle that pulled a trailer on Kjalarnes, where the trailer was in a very bad condition.
The trailer was stopped and the owner intended to provide transportation equipment to transport it to the city.
Then police stopped the production of drugs in the years to come.
Two were arrested for the matter and were released after reporting.
There was also a report of people who shot fires in the year’s town.
Had they been off the scene when police arrived, “they probably knew about the shame, where it is still quite a long time until the end of the year. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk residents still demand Putin's resignation
Yesterday, thousands of civilians were in charge of the Russian city of Khabarovsk and protested the arrest of the district manager in the district, located in East Russia, and the insertion of his successor, who has never lived in the region.
The former head of state, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity and dozens of thousands of Protestants who were arrested and taken into custody in Moscow earlier this month, accused of having ordered murders on three merchants 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally deputized as governor and his 39 - year - old group brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed instead of him, with little enthusiasm for the locals.
When Deggarev said inexperienced and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk, he called the city after his rejection the fastest.
It's called Degtaryev, who's been making an ear blow.
Yesterday, the protesters were little less than the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand; and the demands were the same as before: the deliverance of Furgal, and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we think his arrest is very likely to be illegal," says AFP's 30-year-old protester Alina Slepovu.
She claims that Kremlar’s agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
Khabarovsk police disputed Protestants despite the blatant violation of the demand for the Korean virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met in Pushkin Square to show Protestant support in Khabarovsk, says in the British Guardian report.
The Furgals Group, the Freewill Democratic Party of Russia, is a group of tyrannical internationalists, and is regarded by political experts as somewhat loyal to the Kremlin Government in most cases.
The same political experts, however, inform the BBC that the victory of Furgal in the district chief elections two years ago — which was severe and incontrovertible — had been a major shock to Putin and United Russia, and although it suggests that Kremlar’s grasp of the eastern world was weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and transferred to Moscow, where he is awaiting trial.
He is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were left, and the third was gone out of the midst.
Sarah Rainsford, BBC reporter in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy great popularity at home, are convinced that the charge and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited until now to arrest him, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Timbers surrendered when the hurricane Hanna rode across South Texas

Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a skilled woman who is educated as a dresser, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a vast Covid area in Chennai, where some 10,000 cases have been identified.
It starts at 7:30 a.m. working day and ends at 4:00 p.m.
She recommends the warmth of the residents, asks for symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing their hands regularly, and keeping others away.
In fact, her work has made it possible to detect and treat infections over time in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 people in Chennai City who do their homework but are not health professionals.
The project, according to the authorities, has helped to reduce the number of positive cases by 50 percent, in the daily Chennai census, while increasing in other Tamil Nadu regions.
Shanthi says not all residents are cooperatives.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, though, become irritated.
But this is not to worry about.
I think people should be safe.
When I come back the next day, people are being polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's gist room for women with disabilities and fight against Covid-19 teams.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who is also disabled, has also participated in the campaign as a supervisor.
Although she has a specially designed bicycle, Kavitha starts walking to meet people, holding on to her heels.
“ I’m happy, ” she says of a reduction in infection, but she adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can make it."
At the first height of the castorium, where the two live, are Matilda Funceca, a wheelchair-based basketball company, and Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data that travels from about 40 women to the Chennai City Web server.
Matilda says he's not afraid to get infected with the crown virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what action it is taking, Manimekalai says: “I wear a mask, keep it away, and often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabashura Kudineer, a sitsha drink that enhances the immune system."
A few months ago, when the crown virus first came to Chennai, these disabled women spent their time and abilities sewing masks for healthcare professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao, who is the director of the gist plant, and the Dorcas research centre that runs the shelter, says: “They adapt to needs at any time.
Before, masks were needed, and they did not leave behind.
Now it's time to intervene in society and then they answered the call."
There are now 200,000 Korean virus infections in Tamil Nadu after 6989 new cases last day, including the largest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died, and 7758 have recovered over a 24 - day period.
The total number of infections in the state is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out about a teenager's last trip to Helensburgh.
Researchers investigating the death of a teenager in Helensburgh are now trying to set up a timeline for his final journeys.
The 19 - year - old Kirk Allan's body was found in a home in Johnson Court at 6:25 p.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with the death.
He'll be in Dumbarton's court on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our mind is with Kirk’s family and friends in these difficult times.
Politicians will continue to work with and support society.
Our research continues to get a full picture of what happened, especially the Church's last days before his death, but we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
The last few weeks have shown that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial rights in sports in South Africa.
Building conversations must take place, and action is needed to welcome everyone in sports.
Ashwell Prince, a former croquet star at Proteas, told his former white teammates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black forces were "soccers".
Prince said that black Protheas have been officially referred to by their white teammates as “soccers. ”
He added that it was sad that even though black players such as Makhaya Ntini and now Kagidoso Rabada were able to reach the top goals of the sport, some people still associated with the quota talk.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, dropped these comments at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) on Thursday night.
The goal of the organizations is to continue the firefighting debate on historical racial rights in South African sports.
“Just as I said when I relieved myself of community media, it is not my intention to come down and draw people’s names into the forest, but these are real events ...
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected."
Paul Roberts, a former musician and a builder who became a programmer at NASA, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who looks at himself as an optimist, kept an amateur magazine online and attended comic con events earlier in years.
Once a week they puddle with their two daughters, their son-in-law and their 7-year-old granddaughter and play awesome Uno games.
“ They are incredible nerds, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, who is 65 years old, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — she has diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put it at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a stomat that previously has a blocked coronary artery open.
“We’ve been so careful, very careful, and stay away from people,” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working from home in spring, when the epidemic fought hard in Washington State, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has gone to a large market on a number of occasions during the “old age, ” and the only real policy they had in recent months was, according to Sheryl, when they began to examine wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter also took care of her.
But then she came home sneezing from work one day at mid - June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she had coughing, fever, headache, and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical signs of the crown virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, got gloves, washed my hands,” said Sheryl.
"You do everything right, but you get infected anyway."
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with positive coronary virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, just like their daughter, and then got warm and much pain in the body.
Then he became “very sick, moderately fast, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
June 22nd, he got confused.
Concerned, she looked at his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency hospital for the second time in two days.
The royal couple in the past felt that it was “thinked” in the Queen’s Christmas meal, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, Queen Britain, “thinking ” them in their Christmas vein.
The new story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they felt overlooked by those in the collection who were able to see in Christmas.
Pictures on the desk with which the queen sat included Vilhelm of British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprin and his wife, Kamilla, as well as Philip.
But Meghan and Harry were nowhere to see, despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as the “powerful grandson ” of her Majesty.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends ” because they“ made it difficult to overcome superficial courtesy ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and his brother William’s troubles began some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but they reached their peak because of William’s and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was “disgusting” on events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is said that“he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to life.”

Congressmen of the Ideas Group accuses union leaders of wanting public workers to “be at home forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s protest that people returned to work
Labor leaders were accused of wanting workers to “be at home forever ” after they protested Boris Johnson’s appeal to people to return to work.
The Congressmen of the Children’s Party were angry when the union of public and public employees told their associates to abandon their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their places of employment.
Mr. Andrew Percy, former minister, said that the necessary public service, such as the version of passports, would be stopped while employees in the general market had worked hard to keep the community going in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It’s unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while employees in warehouses and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that public employees can eat during this period,” he said.
“ Many of these workers now want to spend their summer vacations, but they cannot do so because of the people who refuse to return to their jobs, even though they are safe.
Labor leaders cannot maintain this policy of staying at home forever — especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following a statement by Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of public service, announced that the council would “disappear from the fact that officials in the public service are at home, and hurrying their return to work until August 1st. ”
The union of public and public employees expressed to their comrades, who account for 200,000 people, that they would not have to meet this requirement, saying that this is about politics.
A spokesperson of the public and public employees’ union, the largest union of public employees in Britain, said that the requirement to return to the workplace was “not presented with the health and safety of our associates in the first place, or to strengthen the economy.
This is a one - way approach to political pressure from the Congressmen of the Contention Party, who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to the community is clear: If you do your homework and someone in your department asks you to come back to work, don't take it for granted that you have to do it."
The issue is due to increasing dissatisfaction with late passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now announced that it will "seek to speed up" British applications for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for more than four weeks to receive a passport.
The trade union of public and public employees has admitted that some have had to wait up to 143 days after passports, but argues that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4,000 staff members of the passport service to stay at the necessary distance.
David Davis, former government minister, urged the leaders of trade unions to “make their way ” and seek ways to cooperate with governments to get people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in the government, he would ask an executive: “What is it you want, that people stay at home all summer? ”
However, several of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to people to return to work.
A study in larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Focus on History Can Have an Important Continuity
The granny has widened, but understanding and sweetness should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
A little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only discipline that deals specifically with our history — “Saga Australia” before class 12 — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the state of Victoria completed a total of 49,324 students in Australia, or only 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost been reduced by half, but nearly 100 fewer students register each year.
The primary reason so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th grade history is that little has been done in previous study years to interest them.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “science of thought. ”
That is why students in the 7th and 8th century completed only one brief unit on "the ancient and island lands of Torres and their culture".
Year 9 and 10, there is another unit in Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during elementary school years.
During the years 9 and 10, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become an independent subject, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only taught as a part of thought, it has little space in the curriculum.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in thought but have not studied history.
History, such as the analysis of information, is complex.
We need to recruit more specialized historians to ensure that such skills are perceived in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia’s history will become a compulsory discipline from 1788 to 1914.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, for then they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of the story alone does not bridge a deep gap between races.
But without her, as can be seen clearly in the Victorian curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aaron Elis in a final game on the European Union - Ice cream divided by a half game
Aaron Eli’s son - in - law is in the final game of European seats in Danish football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half with Norrköping’s top team against Falkenberg’s founder in Sweden.
Aron Elís was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play for the lead in the European Parliament.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the teams end up after the final round later this day.
Aron Elís played the entire 1–1 match with Horsens at the branch today, while OB had won the first team game at home, 3–1, and thus won the 1st round of a total of 4–2.
Isaac was in the early part of Norrköping, an unexpected 2-0 below after the first half against Falkenberg's corral in the Swedish prime department.
At the beginning of the second half, Norrköping made a triple split, and Isaac was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping reached an equal level, but Falkenberg reached 3–2 in 89 minutes.
However, there was still time for Norrköping to recuperate from hell at the last moment, 3–3.
Norrköping remains at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg and five points ahead of Malmö, which will play well later today.
Falkenberg was able to escape from the bottom for now, but the team is a ladder above Helsingstadt and Kalmar, which have a good game.
Collecting sources for the National Festival of Chorovirus Times
Anna Lilja Victory daughter created the Facebook group "My 2020 National Festival" to gather sources of the national festival that the islanders are planning to celebrate next weekend.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja chatted with Hvata on the weekend.
“ There’s nothing yet that’s very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so people are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There is something about the islanders ’ having tent holidays at home.
“ People have talked about spending time with their own [festival], perhaps camping in the garden, and hoarding the family together as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect people to spend time with their people.
However, she likely says that many will simply not be there “but still to celebrate some small festival somewhere else. ”
A national festival committee is now working hard to repay the purchased tickets, but Anna believes that many locals would rather make sure that next year’s festival is served.
"They're even investing now in the tickets and paying by 2021."
"I'm a great National Festivalman, I love the preparation and all about it, but sometimes something comes into the life that you don't control, and then it's just that," says Anna, "but it's been a bit hard for people to ask if they can't let go of the National Festival once."
Anna Lilja claims that she has not set up the group for herself or to encourage people to observe their own National Festival, but to gather reports of the Festival of Merchants in the Islands this year.
“ What have people done in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in one thing or something, but then someone who uses that kind of authority into something comes into play, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what it's doing."
A fire has also been added to the Peripheral Rock, which is set on fire every year.
“ I think a lot of people are excited about having a fire on Friday night.
Of course, the only thing that makes a line in the account is that the prediction is nothing."
“It will be lit in this fire, but it just has to show how it will be,” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in a new discourse on sexual immorality?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in court.
U.S. Judge has decreed that secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among what is found in these 80 pages of documents are parts of Maxwell’s testimony from 2016
The display of these pages could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew, who in them will find communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, alleged sexual servant of the disgraced U.S. financier, claimed in court that she had been forced to have a relationship with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrés is now preparing to protect himself from the possible publication of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with the child molester Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged scientist, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 secret legal documents in connection with Maxwell and Epstein, which account for hundreds of pages.
The presentation of these vastly extensive documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, since they have much to do with her testimony before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said are “a lot of questions” about her sex story.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, alleged a sexual servant of the disgraced U.S. financier, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to have a relationship with Andrew.
Andrés has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these claims.
A computer email from 2015 that was leaked and the BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for help in responding to Robert’s claims.
We are in no doubt that the Duke will rebel
There he told the superior lady: “Let me know when we can talk, and I have some questions to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied, “I have information, so call me when you have a moment off. ”
Last night a source near Andrési said: “The Duke of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about opening up legal documents.
As U.S. courts have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court.
The U.S. courts have encouraged the media and the public to take full care of the allegations made in court.
We totally agree.
We are in no doubt that the Duke will receive the full uprising of the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in custody at the Manhattan detention centre, awaiting trial to locate and seduce some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of perjury for refusing to know about his abuse.
She rejects all charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s virginity, who is now under Giuffre’s surname, which she recorded after marriage.
About 40 of a total of 418 with that testimony were made public last year, but after the decision of Judge Presna in New York last week, more items could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week of appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was being tried for sexual abuse.
Detectives are looking for a gang of violent attacks on the streets of Edinburgh.
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and injured him who could prove to be permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:30 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who conducts the study, said: “It was a violent and unwarranted attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One was thought to be in 40 years of age, about a height of 180 cm and strong - grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in a white shirt, dark pants, and dark shoes.
Detective Miles said: “When the attack was made, I would ask everyone in this area and see something suspicious about making a move. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Secretary of State of Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
He is said to have been “annoyed ” about his safety since he arrived in the country last year.
This is reflected in the CBS report, which also states that this will is done by Gunter, despite his working in “the one safest kingdom in the world. ”
Gunter is said to have been waiting for the U.S. Foreign Council to comply with the Icelandic government’s obligation to carry a gun.
Then he's been asking for an armored car and a vest that protects him from the stabs of a knife.
However, CBS’ sources tell the board that Gunter has reported that he is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS’ report, the Icelandic Foreign Affairs Council did not provide information as to whether a request had been made from the United States on the possible arms issue of Gunter, because the authorities did not express their views on the security measures taken by foreign carriers.
Yet, the news agency’s sources say that no request has been made.
CBS has also found that his sources have said that Gunter should not seek to carry weapons, for this would be taken as an insult in this country.
Gunter has been a medical practitioner in California for several years.
He is active in the U.S. Republican team and a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently drew attention to this country when he rehearsed the "invisible China Virus".
CBS’s sources also say that Gunter was greatly affected by the U.S. Missionary Council in Reykjavík.
He had already had seven second-in-ranking officials in the embassy from May of last year.
Among other things, he accused them of belonging to the "Deep Kingdom" so-called, which is to be the net of American officials working against Trump, and reacted angryly to the fact that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February before the conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but that eventually Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and did so in May.
The home game form is a key to Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham is expected to play easier when the fans get back on the game.
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotfrag has not lost a game in the home area since the senior division started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good record at home if the viewers were allowed to play.
Ask has won 12 victories at home during this season, but lost four times — only one of the six teams above have lost more at home.
The coach in Portuguese said that while such victories were possible without the fans, it would be easier to maintain them if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them we can build some kind of work, where the play programme is in the foreground,” he said.
"But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game, which is only next with the help of fans at the home playground."
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the long seasons of victory in the home area he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up three seasons in the past.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether it has reached its goals at the end of the period, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere on the field can divide considerably.
"I believe that the policy of the high-ranking department is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to meet these poor values because of what has been good."
“However, it is important to be strong at home and at the end of the season have brought in a number of ladders with victories in home games.”
“ I’m happy with the results from home games recently, without the fans, but we need them back.
I see victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
It's a feeling of sympathy built up small and small."
Buyers excited about their sought-after lifestyle in Lovely Banks
"Greater is better," is clearly the motto of the new owner of a vast new property in the neighborhood of Lovely Banks, which was recently sold at $1270 Australian dollars.
Interested buyers seeking a life - style property near Geelong’s city centre were forced to look at this 1.35 - acres [1.35 ha] land, where 14 cars, swimming pool and views of Corio Bay can be found.
Joe Grgic, a real estate dealer at Harcourts in North Geelong, said that an offer in the countryside that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its launch.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back for sale
Optional Home for Isolation
“ We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
"The property was sold to a very excited householder."
The property features four rooms on two levels, including a private bathroom, which is large enough to sleep.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use a kitchen and an upgraded outdoor area with a view over the pool.
"This was how the property was put together, that it was three squirrels, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“ Here there came interested merchants from Melbourne, who wondered what the property was in the middle of the country, but still with a rural population.
"I am with people who have missed and buyers who are still looking."
He said that the large storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing shed with a capacity of 10-12 vehicles, would be perfect for industrialists or to store bicycles and trailers.
Counting Its Security Threat in Iceland
"Despite being appointed as the most secure country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been passionate about his safety since he arrived at Reykjavik in the last year."
This is how CBS News talks about the U.S. ambassadors in Iceland, but this mimics many of CBS’ sources from the U.S. foreign service.
According to CBS, Gunter requested special permission from the Icelandic authorities to carry firearms at the U.S. Foreign Council.
Then he should also have wanted an armored car, as well as ideas about a vest that could protect him from a knife attack.
The U.S. Foreign Affairs Council refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is really threatened in Iceland, but according to official information Gunter has repeatedly been told that he is not in any particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced after full-time lifeguards, including in the July 18th morning newspaper, but CBS's sources imitated that this was done to suppress anxiety Gunter.
The U.S. Foreign Affairs Council does not express itself about any significant security measures associated with its mission, but it always states that safety is guaranteed by a preventive means.
The Ministry does not answer questions concerning Gunter’s request to prepare arms and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry does not wish to indicate whether the United States formally requested that the ambassador carry firearms, and usually does not comment on the security issues of the foreign agency.
According to CBS, however, according to its Icelandic sources, its request has never been made, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was received from these plans, where they could cause domestic insults in Iceland.
CBS also discusses the various problems that have been encountered by the U.S. Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed an ambassador last year, but he will have already replaced his deputy officer seven times.
In this way, the first deputy officer is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the status at the last minute because Gunter “does not suffer from it ” at their first meeting.
His successors have not done much better under Gunters.
Government officials within the U.S. Foreign Affairs Council are said to be aware of the position at the embassy in Iceland, but are reluctant to intervene in a case closely linked to the President.
In addition to all of this, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the various rules of foreign service and to respect the order of authority.
Gunter went to the United States in February to join the Washington conference, and he is said to have refused to return to Iceland in the wake of this and to have his temporary place in his ministry for months to come, and in the middle of a pandemic.
Mr. Gunter has even wished to do his job on the ground and said he will not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, asked for it in particular.
According to information from the U.S. Foreign Affairs Council, Gunter had decided to take his personal leave at the end of the conference and the crown virus epidemic would delay him even further, but according to CBS sources, many within the agency have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he had not done so until May, after Pompeo had contacted him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also reports that Gunter’s unpopularity in Iceland, especially in connection with a season where he calls the Korean virus “Invisible China Virus” and has received a lot of criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost unexperienced, ambassadors appointed during the reign of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachin Pilot versus Ashok Ghlot; Bharatiya Janata Group says government crisis; Congress Party wants vote payment
Ashok Ghlot said that if there was a need for it, the Congress Party would have to make a countermeasure outside the home of the Prime Minister.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest against Raj Bhawan in Jaipur, Prime Minister Rajasthan Ashok Ghellot said that if there was a need for Congressional Congressmen to meet the President and to make a counterpoint outside the home of the Prime Minister to lead the kris in the State to smell.
At the Congressional Congressional Assembly meeting, Ghellot indicated that the intention was to hold a vote to see if the majority of the Congressors and the allies were in the power struggle with him.
"He said the government has the majority and wants to go to vote," says Mahesh Joshi, the chief congressman, after the meeting.
The congressional meeting was held in a hotel, where the congressmen who support Gehlot have remained in the last days.
“ The prime minister asked us to stay at the hotel longer.
If that were necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold a peaceful protest outside the home of the Prime Minister," said the class leader.
Chief Minister Rajasthan may convene the Congress and have the Congress Party present to the majority, said the group leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, suggesting that the Bharatiya Janata team had come up with a plan to overthrow the government of Ashok Ghallot.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and served by the authority of the people.
It has come up with the advice of Bharatiya Janata to overthrow Rajasthan’s government.
This is an insult to 80 million people in Rajasthan.
The prime minister must convene the assembly so that the truth comes before the land," Gandhi said in a tithe of Hinduism.
Mr. Ashok Ghlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said on Saturday that he was prepared to attend a meeting of the presidents of India to ensure that what he calls "the councilman of Bharatiya Janata" to delay a vote of confidence.
Gahlot, who had protested for hours at the home of Governor Kalray Mishra on Friday to push for a congressional meeting, met with Congressional and government congressmen on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by government.
Last night, Mishra asked Ghellot to return the conference request and referred to six objections.
The proposal will soon be sent to the governor.
Gahlot has accused the governor of delaying the congress, where he is “under pressure, ” of delaying the vote, which determines confidence in his government.
When Gahlot met with his government, a commission from Bharatiya Janata headed by the leader Satish Poonia and the leader of the government opposition from Gulab Chandra Kataria with the governor to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.
A fire in a car just outside of Borgarnes
A traffic jam was needed when a car crashed just above the golf course of Hamar at Borgarnes just before 4: 00 p.m.
According to the Civil Service fire department, the car has successfully turned off the fire and is now waiting for it to be removed.
Two were in the car when the fire started due to a technical failure in the people’s car, both of which are safe and completely damaged.
The traffic needed to be steered during the fire brigade, but heavy traffic is in the area in both directions.
Spencer Grammer, the actress, made cuts outside the restaurant in Manhattan.
NEW YORK — Spencer Grammar’s actress said he was trying to calm down when he cut her arm and put her friend in the back of a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, told US Weekly that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same circumstances and that they had been trying to stop the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend sat at the front desk at The Black Ant in the East Village area of Manhattan at 23:30
on Friday, when a man came up to them, and demanded to be paid, and the restaurant was shut down.
Grammer and her friend were hurt when they tried to “dissolve a dispute between an unknown man and other local guests, ” says the police.
The man ran off the spot after hurting Grammer’s right arm and stabbed her friend in the back with an unknown tip, said a police officer.
Nobody's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the series "Rick and Morty" and previously played in the series "Greek" at ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both she and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injury, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded to the scene and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who listened to them and referred to the “unbelievable struggle” of these personnel at the crown virus epidemic.
“ It really touched us to have an opportunity to thank them in person, ” Grammer said.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sports News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star UFC after having registered himself in the history of Fight Island, but he says he's not going to flag his wealth in a blazing way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the Northern Irish Rhys McKee Superintendent in their battles in a fragrant field in Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he defeated his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds were passed by the first round by making his punch in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in the history book UFC for the short time between victory in the modern history of the contest, where only 10 days had passed since he won the British John Phillips in a similar way, then in a medium.
Chimaev, with a winning ratio of 8-0, received 50,000 American dollars for tonight's performance against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so full that it is now referred to as "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be inextricable comparison because of the likelihood of superiority of Chimaev and UFC Master in light and since he is born in Chechnya, which is near the home of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite new fame and financial benefits, the translator Chimaev has said that he would not be happy to flag his wealth like the MMA money engine Conor McGregor or his counterpart in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I’m not just doing this for myself, I’m doing this for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," replied Chimaev when asked about how he would use the bonus at Fight Island.
Among other things, he has alerted fellow Conor McGregor and active Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote to the community broker that he could “easyly” defeat Chimaev with a surrender.
There was no poisonous response from the fighter who came under the name "Borz", or "wolf" in his native Czech, who said he would "paint Danis with his eyes closed".
Chimaev, now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may have little to do with his financial strength, but he is obviously not in a position to play his battle skills.
“ I can grind anyone...
How many fighters are in the Velvet Department?
I can grind them all," he said.
"Give me 77 kilos of master (voltivitis), 84 kilos of master (military), I grind them both, the same day."
Israel continues to oppose the reaction of the prime minister to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against prime ministers in many parts of the land on Saturday and were the biggest protests outside the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they started because of what critics believe the government’s failure to deal with the Korean virus epidemic after initial efforts to control the virus.
Netanyahu’s accusations of corruption have further pushed the protests.
"Bibi, go home," stood on the sign of the Protestants.
On the second issue, we read: “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants gathered outside Netanyahu beachhouse in the prosperous city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
Following what has been called a fluent and unorganized re-opening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day up to 2000.
The country’s economy has been hit because of the virus’s limitations and unemployment has grown to nearly 20%.
The protesters say that the government’s financial assistance is far from sufficient.
The protests took place in the shadow of the trial of corruption charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Interviews will begin in January.
He is accused of fraud, betrayal, and bribery in a series of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants gather in the center of Los Angeles to show their solidarity with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — Some 300 Protestants met in the center of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon in support of two-month-old movements in Portland, Oregon, where attention was paid to federal police following conflicts with Protestants.
Similar conventions took place in many parts of the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The convention in Los Angeles was organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group headed for the Los Angeles Police headquarters on First Street and Main Street and then went to the city center.
The participants also transferred to the Alameda
Part of the people saw broken windows in federal buildings in the middle of town, and fudges were written on federal markings.
At least one individual was arrested in the Protestant congregations.
50 people in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, say the Karnataka government
The Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, is held July 31st and August 1st.
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 may congregate in mosques for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other locations for the crown virus epidemic.
Guests who wish to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep away, as instructed by AB Ibrahim, the council chief of minority and Wakf issues.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Eid-ul-Azha festival, also called or Bakrid, should be held on July 31st in the Udup, Dakshina Kannada and Kodaga districts, while August 1st elsewhere in the state.
The order states that although prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of the Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events at Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COWID-19 epidemic.
Prayer, however, will be allowed in mosques, provided that no more than 50 participate at once.
If more than that were to be done in prayer, the council says in the order.
Prayer meetings anywhere else, such as meeting rooms, social centers, or Shadi Mahal, must not be held.
The Karnataka government allows temples, mosques, and other places of prayer to be opened to those who wish to pray from June 8, provided that the COWID-19 virus is well guarded.
The U.S. Ambassador Wants Armed Guard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador to Iceland, believes his life is threatened from abroad and wants to carry weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy advertised the bodyguard lifeguard in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kleik’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter thinks his life is threatened in Iceland.
In Iceland and abroad, a fire has spoken to the ambassadors who are convinced that he is in great danger and that he is a Jew.
The threat is not as clear, but the commentors of Kleik said that Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
CBS reported on the matter on his web this morning, and according to Washington authorities, Gunter is a paranoia, demanding that he carry his own weapon, that he get a punch-proof vest, and that he be escorted along with a bulletproof vehicle.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been repeatedly told that there is no threat and that the advertisement after "bodyguard" is only to sleep Gunter.
According to Kleik’s sources, the positions had not yet been adjusted by June, but the application deadline expired in February.
According to Kleik’s sources, the U.S. Embassy has not received a formal request for these changes.
No formal request has been made for increased custody or for access to lifeguards outside the embassy wall.
The Icelandic law makes it clear that this is not permitted unless it has a special authority from the Commissioner of State.
The operators of Kleik within the system say no information is available on any kind of threat.
The latest risk assessment by the police officer is somewhat decisive about terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence of terrorist or extreme activity here.
The conditions for the authorisation of the lifeguard of a foreign embassy on the streets of the cities and towns of Iceland are not, according to the Kleiks sources, available.
Gunter paid considerable attention to this country when he shared the U.S. President's title and called the COWID-19 China virus.
With his tithe, he had the flag of the United States and Iceland.
Radio operator in Seattle who mocked Trump’s reaction to protests says he now needs a gun after the Starbucks coffee shop below his apartment was destroyed – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has been given a new perspective on violent protests after bragging that U.S. President Donald Trump in June for saying that the anarchists are burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed to make a scene was closer to the member’s home.
“I feel as if I need to buy a gun because this will clearly continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he noticed that the destroyers had “damaged” the Starbucks coffeehouse on the lower floor of his apartment house.
It looks like a street party down the street from me, very angry now."
It was completely different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are useless," said the President.
“ The terrorists are burning and robbing our cities, and they just find it wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, co-director of the "Danny & Gallant" radio station ESPN in Seattle, replied with a tithe: "Go through there for curiosity last night and saw neither burns, robbery nor deaths. Relax. "
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building because explosives might be found in the damaged Starbucks coffeehouse.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, you idiots, ” and noted that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I don't know what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out."
The reversal did not go unnoticed by people who ridiculed Gallant for his previous opinion and frequent messages such as “Just relax on the salmon,” and “Well, maybe Trump was right”.
Jason Rantz, another radio stationer in Seattle, said, “I guess we’re not going to go to the end of this poll we discussed. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Awoke and saw that a lot of people were squeezing out to me. I laughed. ”
He said he stood by his earlier statement as he would have walked through the CHAZ self-government area of the anarchist and though it would not be as bad as it would have been pronounced.
"So it was burned and robbed after all," he said, "pretty."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, started together at the shooting point of the White Lines, which deals with sugar and soda in Ibiza, but in the search for accommodations over the past week, their reputation was different and calm, far from the party life.
The couple, who play siblings in the Netflix series, were popular, saw a magnificent farm in Oxfordshire, which is sold at 1.2 million pounds.
They met in the range Rover area, which Laura, 34, drove, dressed in galastuffs and white shirts, and met there a real estate store that led them on a survey trip around the five - room house.
In the White Lines, which was taken up last autumn, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who met the darker side of Ibiza when she investigated the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship was not established until earlier this month, less than a year after the end of the six-year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, which is known from Hunger Games movies.
Together, the four - year - old son Pip and daughter Margot, who is two years old, are married.
When they announced their divorce in August last, 34 Claflin wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to understand the issue of divorce, and we understand it in love, friendship, and deep respect for each other, and we will continue our cooperation with them about the upbringing of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in 2011 in an audition, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “unquestionably one of the greatest achievements of my life”.
Before she got her role in White Lines, Laura had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the BBC's crime drama The Capture, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannuh Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the series of Brittania from Sky.
Counting too early to claim another wave here on land
A specialist in the field of psychiatric disease at the County Council said too soon that he claimed the second wave of the epidemic.
Three new indigenous infections were detected in the National Hospital’s virologic division yesterday and are now in the pyrexia.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a man in his 30 ’ s, the other in a man in his 20 ’ s.
Then there was no infection since the beginning of the month.
Last night, there were three more domestic infections, one of which had been at the Rey Cup soccer tournament in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a news office, Mr. K. Johansson, a national police officer, said that less was needed because of transmission than originally thought.
Another infection is that of a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, rules for so - called home invasions had come to an end.
Camilla Rut Sigfusdóttir, a specialist in the field of psychiatric diseases at the National Medical Association, says that this person, however, followed the old process.
The vision of him was negative when he came to the land, and he became sick when he was in solitary confinement, and six were put in a pyrexia.
They're all on their way to the sample, but two of them are beginning to show signs.
The third infection is associated with the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been exposed to 12 diseases associated with it.
It has been shown that there is a new variant of the crown virus that has not been identified before in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus type comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is thought to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It is too early to claim that the so - called second wave of the epidemic has gone off in this country, as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority are still vulnerable, it is not a fictitious matter.
But we are on the toe and are watching, considering ways to fail if anything like that could start."
Megan Fox expresses himself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twins in the rapper Machine Gun Kelly.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul is about it," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ The dual soul is when the soul has come to an adequate degree so that it can divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two-half the same soul, I think.
I told him as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him out in his life.
I decided to go to the depths immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they met on film.
“ I started to hang outside her trailer and hoped to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced his husband, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim.
U.S. musician, fashion bully, and president candidate Kanye West have apologized to their wife, Kim Kardashian West, for his official remarks about family privacy.
“I want to apologize to my wife, Kim, for having discussed private matters publicly, ” he wrote in a Twitter post last night.
The status of their relationship has been vastly vandalized, but Kanye has recently attended a major social media conference and a mass conference held last Monday, including the birth of his daughter North West, and said he almost killed her.
Kim then stepped forward on Wednesday and published a message to her followers on Instagram, discussing her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously made a public statement about the husband’s illness, saying that this is because of the children of his wife and the rights of Kanye to privacy when his health came to light.

Racial Rights in the United States Increased Opposition
The protesters have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd was put to death by the Minneapolis police in Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal agents to Portland, and thus has yet to meet with protests.
The protesters are now also protesting the presence of federal policemen in the city.
On Saturday in Seattle, police used flash bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after protests to support the Portland protests were unleashed in violence.
According to the police, more than 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into the Black Lives Matter claim.
The media say that before he was shot, man may have gone up to a car with a rifle armed.
"The bottom line is that it is terrible that someone should be killed in protest," said Steve Adler, mayor of Austin.
Adler said he was “harmless and unspoiled. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the Breonna Taylor case, a black woman who died in Louisville when police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot the police because he thought they were burglars.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor’s death, but the other policemen have not been prosecuted.
The NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in Taylor’s murder investigation.
According to police information, on Saturday, three members of the NFAC were injured when gunshots were accidentally fired by the rebel army.
Peripheral infection potential
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside border screening.
Two of these infected individuals were identified with unseen variants of the virus, and the source of three of the five infections appears to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has left the country or the asymptomatic Icelander, who is likely to have infected much more.
A local pharmacologist says that a possible group infection may be broken up in connection with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The source of the infection is still unclear.
Three were then detected with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of the individuals diagnosed on Thursday, another coming to the country on July 15 last, and likely infected outside, but the third is also infected with an unknown source.
Following a serial analysis in the Icelandic genetic analysis, the two individuals diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new variants, which have not been identified before in this country.
Camilla Josephsdaughter, a specialist in the field of psychiatric disorders at the Land doctor’s office and a local pharmacologist, says that the Icelandic genetic diagnosis is now considering the most likely source of this type of virus.
“ Another case was similar to the virus that has been in progress in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it out better, and they're going to draw a chance at what part of the world the disease comes from," she says.
"However, it seems to be here on the Atlantic side."
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two that occurred at the beginning of July and were traced to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species is out of place rather than having leaped here in the interior?
“ Yes, this is different from what has been found here before, ” says Kamilla, “that there’s really no chance that this was something to mutilate here. ”
"These individuals are all likely in some way to be exposed to a person who has just come outside without knowing it."
It says that there is still no indication of where this new virus may have come from.
“ Of course, it could be a traveler who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected, and that could naturally result in more infections.
We'll be on our toes for the next few days to keep track of it."
“ There’s nothing yet that’s a smart group infection.
However, there are individuals who had a disease associated with one of the diseases last night, who have symptoms and have had a demonstration," Kamilla continues.
“ We haven’t got the results from them yet.
So it could possibly be a group infection in the seal."
Is it now expected to be a social issue?
“ That is not impossible.
It has not been recently, but it is not excluded because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, though, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep this in mind, even if there are such limits to how much we can take in people’s visions.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but once we're getting an infection that seems unattainable, we need to be given a little looser hands by taking samples of people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the National Hospital’s Antibacterial and Virologics Department will be able to present in the sample in the next few days to try to map the situation here in the country better.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the visibility of the interior and take care of screens at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there is a need to provide some basis for taking samples in individuals who are not in the screening activities; the person must be at risk and show signs or symptoms or have had symptoms and suspicions of reaching the level of someone who has just come to the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that infection is still in progress with the infections detected yesterday and that much work is now being done to gain information about the movements of individuals.
It says that the source of the intra-Community infections seems incontrovertible, but does not rule out the possibility that some of those who have been exposed to the disease may provide clues that ultimately lead to the transmission of infectious agents to the original infections.
The spot most people know but think one of the best
Not all of us have a clear location where the restaurant Bjargarstein is located and are likely to have more fans from abroad than here on the land if there are indications of it on TripAdvisor and on other sites.
People who have flown across the country have heard of him to visit him with no wonder.
Berglind Hreðarsdóttir, food blogger and food novelist, took a start on Bjargarstein on the days, and was watered with enthusiasm.
“ I don’t know where to start, so the restaurant Bjargarstein on the ground floor is simply a wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the most delicious things I know, the food up to ten, the view not of the worse end and the fantasticly fun-loving servants," says Berglind.
“ The god, the owner of Bjargarstein, magicd every precious right in front of us.
My wife and I sat together with our girls all night to chat, so it must tell us how good the food was," adds Berglind.
“ The house in which the restaurant is located is an old apartment house that was moved all the way to Grunderfjörd.
At present, the owners pushed their eyes into this house for the sale of Akranes, found a beautiful seashore on the ground floor, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the home page of Bjargarstein."
“ The buildings and all the furnishings on Bjargarstein are unique.
The whole family has been gathered together, and it is truly a mess.
On the upper floor is a lounge and really cozy and homey to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and the food supply then do not conceal itself, and it is clear that much is put on the magic of tasty and beautiful food,” says Berglind, who is a target of the photos, is not a lie.

The Danish State Radio, DR, has noted to the spokesman of the Danish court that it is uncertain how long the prince, who is 51 years old, will stay at the hospital, but his feelings are constant.
DR reports that we are now examining how the blood clot has affected the prince’s health.
It has been reported by your doctor Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who is dealing with health issues for DR, that the consequences of blood clots in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“ It can be anything from negligible symptoms to half paralysis, memory problems, or difficulty in expressing, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for many months of rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprin, named Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and also Count of Monpezat, stayed at the family vineyard, Château de Cayx, in South France when he got sick on Friday night.

Google Pixel 4 can build the galaxy
Double optical attraction enables the pixel 4 extra lens to look in three dimensions, thus returning a better mood in a background with a facial image than in previous pixel enzymes, which relied firmly on software to achieve these so-called "bokeh" effects.
To demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google got the legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz on stage to discuss his experience of photography with Pixel 4 in the last 12 months.
Engineering is still in the foreground in all aspects of new Google smart phones, and on this phone, “computerized photography” is new to improve the HDR+ setting by combining up to nine different images.
New two-dimensional lighting controls offer different levels of brightness and shadow and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on machine study to offer better automatic whitening and to add a Night Sight night setting, which is so sensitive that it can capture the Milky Way in the night sky.
In addition to the other camera operator, Pixel 4 Soli presents the front of the phone “ratsaw chip” that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can skip right, turn off time-points, turn off the sound of the phone, or turn off the phone by waving their hand.
All calculations for Motion Sense are performed on the device instead of connecting to the Internet and the same applies to the enhanced Google resource, as the technology giant is now emphasising the reduction of response time and the improvement of user privacy.
Google’s continued emphasis on using its machine learning capabilities to the full has also led to a new voice recording app that converts sounds directly without sending data to the Internet.
The app is currently available only in English, but more languages are available.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a game scene in the cloud that will be launched by the decks of November 19th in the United States, but still after reporting the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have sound adjustments that listen to the environment and always set the sound to the point that the clarity is the greatest.
New Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids are completely wireless and set the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also announced an update of its Wi-Fi interconnectors in the Nest WiFi line with a number of core locations that work together to improve the wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, double its predicament and add built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google Helper in each home base.
It will be sold in Australia on November 5th and will cost 399 astrolids for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but new $79 Nest Mini improves the quality of the sound by double the bass and has been built-in wall mounting.
All Google smart speakers will get new call system features for communication between devices in the home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

A waltz hunter “saw the love of throwing a beer bottle to sell” in Devon
A waltz hunter threw a beer bottle into a cell when he disturbed the fishing line, according to a charity organization.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show you on a rock that throws an object towards an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the gray seller had been fishing when the stencil hunter emptied out of the bottle and threw it in the back of the animal.
Kenny called this “horrible and careless behavior. ”
He said he had been picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning with other people in the seal conservation company Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
“ The cell tried to get to the fishing line, ” he said.
“ The fisherman stretched the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the market.
"The bottle fell on the back of the cell and he swam away."
An expert said that “what is better is sold by a strong - built animal ” than that the sale had simply been doing what is natural to him.
“ By throwing a glass bottle into it, you’re stopping it on its hunts, ” he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was “not an isolated incident” and that it had recently received “a lot of announcements about this aggressive behaviour”.
The Society’s Facebook entry says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope's Nose on Sunday and that “a lot of examples of antisocial behavior” had been seen.
All sellers enjoy protection under the law of protection, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A giant from the Christian Polli in Laxá, Dalum
The first hundred people were hunted in Laxá, Dalum, in the afternoon.
There was the work of Arnor Isfjörd Gudmundsson.
He had set up a herb in Kristapoll this morning and was 89 centimeters.
After lunch, he returned to Christian Polli, thinking of a story that he had heard that after the nesting had been laden, his stool would be happy.
With this in mind, he went with Collie Dog and threw himself over Kristapoll.
Soon he got a shot and, as he says, he did.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself up completely, and I realized that it was the meter.
I got a little nervous as I had eleven pounds.
Usually I caught fish, but I had it for forty minutes.
Actually, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pool, but then I got to strand him, and it was a great feeling.
Scraped my pole and jumped on it.
He measured 102 centimeters and I doubled him," said a merry hunter in the hunting house of Laxá in Dalum in conversation with the Sporess.
Arnor is as if no one started when a hundred calls occurred.
That was his eighth.
He received such fish in Blandah, Svartah, Hraun's field, Kjarrá, two in Langadalsá, and one in Eystri Rangá.
An excellent fish is in Laxá, Dalum, according to Arnors.
The cave that's gonna finish at noon tomorrow's bringing 35 salmon, and our guy's got 18 of them.
Expecting Great Floods because of Hannah
Hanna, the first hurricane in the Atlantic this year, reached a country in Texas, U.S.A., that night.
Hannah quickly lost her strength and became a storm but, despite the rain, there has been much rain in the area and is expected to be flooded.
It is expected to rain up to a quarter of an inch [30 cm] in one day, but in special places it could reach up to 46 inches [46 cm], according to the AP Newspaper.
Particularly dangerous flash floods that may occur because of rain are warned.
The region where Hannah reached the country has suffered a blow because of the great distribution of the new crown virus there.
In addition, seas have landed and damaged.
At least 43,700 people are now without electricity and have been opened up to a large number of relief stations in the area.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, talked about the hurricane last night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you will see footage captured by the AP reporter this morning.
Houses burned, shoplifted, and inundated
More than sixty are killed and sixty more wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in Darfur District of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the latest in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks, where houses were burned, shops and markets were robbed and damaged, ” states a statement from the United Nations Human Lady Office in the capital of Kartum, which was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, Sudan’s Prime Minister, has announced that security forces will be sent to the district’s armed forces to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, the unconventional army in the area killed at least 20 civilians, including children, in a second attack.
"The promotion of violence in the different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased upheaval, endangering agriculture and threatening the lives and livelihood of people," says the United Nations.
The battle in Darfur, western Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose against the governor of Kartum.
The forces of government and Arab troops who tried to call down the rebellion have been accused of extensive atrocities, but some 300,000 were killed in the UN’s response.
Omas al-Bashir, a chair of Sudan's leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are now trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
The TV news reporter thanked the viewer for noticing cancer buds
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — The Florida TV news reports thanked spectators for noticing a knot on her neck and e - mailing her that she should be checked.
Victoria Price, a WFLA reporter in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price told Twitter that on Monday she was going to have surgery to remove the tumour, thyroid, and a few lymph nodes.
“The doctor said it was to spread, but not too much, and we hope that this will be my first and last operation,” she said.
The audience emailed Price last month and said that the knot reminded her of the knot she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old investigator, said this week that her TV station’s slogan was “8 in your team.”
“ But the role changed recently when the viewer was in the team with ME and I couldn’t be more grateful,” said Price.
“ I’ll be forever grateful to the woman who made an effort to send me an e - mail, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did.
Speaking of being with a man in the team."
Part of Jeronimo Open Space's residential area closed temporarily after two Battalion Battalion attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek route on the Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and closed temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyote almost every morning and usually she tries to avoid them just, but on Saturday morning one came straight at her and bit her foot.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
Mission Viejo City reported: “Today, two different parties announced that the plaice wolf had bitten a human being. Mission Viejo’s animal welfare service is working on the matter in collaboration with the Department of Fish and Animal Life, and part of the Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and watch out when you are traveling where there is a lot of wild animals.”
Wittmer tried to beat the coyote with a bottle of water.
She called the emergency line to get a ride to her car, but she was able to drive to an emergency station herself.
The coyotes disappeared into the hillsides, but public workers hope to fire him and test him for rabies.
Wittmer is treated for rabies as a precaution for the next two weeks.
She said that this frightening incident would not keep her from the morning races, but that from now on she would choose another place.
The condition of the person who was bitten is not clear.
Race Counterparties Join the Seattle Police
A conflict in Seattle on Sunday between police and Protestants against racism ended with the arrest of a number of people, but dissatisfaction among the public over the plans of President Donald Trump of the United States to send a large number of federal policemen into major cities.
A protest against racial hatred and police violence has occurred following the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd in Minneapolis, May.
The conventioners in Seattle trimmed the wheeled cars and smashed the windows of a trailer on Saturday’s protests, causing police to declare unspoiled conditions and empty the streets with peppers and blows.
The conventioners also set fire to a trailer at a construction site for a prospective teenage prison.
The police have ordered 45 people arrested, and 21 police officers have been injured.
The protest march was held in support of the protests in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump decreed very controversial radical action by the federal police, in spite of the local authorities, who say the police use excessive authority.
In Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia, there have been protest marches.
In Austin, Texas capital, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the middle of town on Saturday night, according to the police.
In parallel with the protests, Trump is becoming increasingly difficult to fight for reelection in November, and he has adopted a tough law - enforcement policy.
