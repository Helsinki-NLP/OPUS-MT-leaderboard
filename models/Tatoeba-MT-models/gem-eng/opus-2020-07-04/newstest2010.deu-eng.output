Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
The American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The White House's head will arrive tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the north-west metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First of all, he visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The Presidential couple then arranged a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prize of prestige.
He receives this as the fourth President of the United States, but only as the third to accept the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak about the war on the purchase of the prize.
The President does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
A few days ago, he stepped up the efforts of war by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forgets to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the gold medal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (approx. 24 million crowns).
The money he intends to donate for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitative work.
The event program then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, where, apart from Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant to the price from the beginning.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he did not deserve the price entirely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he argued that this is "call for action" for him.
Protectors are accused of blackmail
Leitmeritz-Polizei accused the chairman of the Civil Society "Natural Protection Community Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases, last year, he filed appeals against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors to his favors, said the Leidmeritz Police Officer, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Natureschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste container in Brno does not smell good
In Prague people can sort out the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you will find again on step and step the sorting garbage container.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage tones.
I do not want to claim that the separation of waste in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if we are the second largest city in the Republic, the Councillors are insufficiently concerned about this problem.
Brno is in the waste race in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastic in the sorting container, but mainly because of the waste ton number for such waste.
Have they tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at some point in the center?
This is just art, before all things it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is Moravia's place in front of the goose affected.
Mr Underka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but that seems to me to be far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not honey in other parts.
I'd rather not sort the waste from my friends' entire ranks.
From laziness.
It is too much for them to go to the garbage cans.
I don't wonder.
I offered myself after the party to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any tints in sight.
Luckily I got to the right place when I was on the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us in the whole Republic shame instead of buying a few garbage tons more and offering the sorting of further raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking on the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company ECO-KO-KOM Brünn is really in the whole district of South Moravia the worst there is.
The "parubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But neither for public debt interests nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be to the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the increase in pay for some groups, they assumed that the government was also paying the money for sensitive spending, old-age pensions or for the sick. "This is just a postponement of problems into the future, mine-laying," says Janota.
The loans pay more and more interest, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state-owned enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for her children.
For the pensions or the sick money, whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry about getting this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state fund, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, debt will rise faster and faster and, together with this, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will not be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its local deficit package.
As a result of the financial downturn in favour of a number of electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the development of motorways and railways.
These are mainly sections of the competition which are no longer re-projectable and which can possibly be reconciled.
Getting at most, which is also not free.
This means the delay or cancellation of thirty large buildings, which is also at risk of European money creation, warns the Transport Ministry's spokesman, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it dissolves the flow of money Salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders, in which the State is the owner of the majority, and is then poured out the money into the transport fund.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never certain and it is not an infinite source at all.
Last year, CEZ spent 18 billion in the budget.
Every year the dividends pay the environmental compensation, fill in the pension account and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, in accordance with EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of the upheavals yet.
Almost three billion went down the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and for crimes or for expenses for court trials, even for building savings.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
It's just gambling.
If we lose an international court trial, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion-dollar "state fund" project, which is designed to monitor on-line for what individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to just press one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within seconds.
This is precisely what the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses on the development of the virtual software for the computers.
We enable you to perform two user profiles at the same time on your phone.
You can switch between them, they can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, dedicated Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware during the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented a few days ago for the first time.
There will be 2012 on the market.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM storage of 128 MB, on which, at the same time, the mentioned systems ran Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices should come within the year 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneeless slopes do not only worry the giant mountain dwellers.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People are going through the offers, fixing the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we believe this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Anyone who wants the New Year's residence in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of your stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The spindle mill hotel owners now offer mainly only weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think they'll be trying to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give up, and they'll have to go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, dear Jandura.
Free beds at all winter seasons always also offers the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week that has not yet been sold out.
In our offer about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared a few cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The New Year's Day in Giant Mountains can also be offered by the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also adversely affected by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reverse and slightly better than last year, the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou manage to occupy.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and at Christmas we have only a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne, 80 percent for New Year's stays.
On the other hand, at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now in February, but at the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a greater snow shearing.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky from the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove was informed.
USA: Repeat is Mother of Smartness
It is almost strange to see the student ambition of Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
Finally, when he sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text he himself used the type of speech "as in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path", without humiliating.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush Idea - sending out fresh military quotas in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "indebted and in their wake a catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush Strategy, which was based on military recommendations, was the only possible and to the extent very successful, that the news about Iraq is no longer being spoken at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved because objectively he left behind his successor a much more grateful starting point than it was expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
In order to increase the military quota, General Stanley McCristal was once again asked by the military, especially the chief commander of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the scathing shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation to the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he mistrusted the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even if he himself originally reckoned with at least 10,000.
Most problematic about the whole Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half increase will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the bridal war in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally established correctly, remain only shantytowns, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the insurmountability of conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran.
The creation of a "workable state", which is the minimalist aim of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy puzzled by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is at the brink of the explosion.
It is believed that the small soldiers who broke out in the cry of war over the "early return" create a miracle here, can only create a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date setting for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is being ignored.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters the way in which the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hinduuch Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, it is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem should not be solved with troops.
This question has to be answered in the period in which America is going to Obama for the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only throttle for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to take on another strategy, if it were to turn out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
The executives of the U.S. Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers get shares instead of the money, but you can only sell them in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the agency Reuters, is thus leading the efforts to combine the premium bonuses of Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of the JPMorgan Company, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after she had put aside nearly 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this year is likely to exceed 20 billion dollars despite the current measure, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to burden the banker's bonuses, which exceed 25 000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes from the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf in the specialized categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer, Herta Müller, was among them also a Romanian descent.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromosome field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded by the Israelis Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for the clarification of the ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have carried out this award for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prizewinners has obtained the diploma, the Nobel medals and certificate of the purchase of the money prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American president, Barak Obama, has already received the most expected Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment because he was only at the beginning of his path, and beyond that he was at the top of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considered the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday, President Vaclav Klaus welcomed the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, who was thinking about his government's stay because he did not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Members' Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remainder of Janota in the Cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis in public finances.
The Presidential Speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota intends to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in office on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus's signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
However, Parliament voted on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals on money laundering and increased the money for public employees, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has held back the proposals of Social Democracy that it conceals the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, there has been a sharp internal political dispute, which is why the question mark on the further work of the Fischer Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is virtually liquidating the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishermen's government in autumn, which, according to their understanding, will end the debt of the state.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, today, during the debate with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" which represents the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a longer time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only result in a strong government which could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS president, Mirek Topolanek, suggested that the budget is cruel and that the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told CTK that the concept of the civil service cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described in the editors similar words as "strong pronouns".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek word that the budget deficit is cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the state budget's approval as a success for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman in the new film by Clint Eastwood
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: Unbeatable" of the world shows much of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the Republic of South Africa as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, shows in his life story of the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could present him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is taken over by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box area, was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which to the end has become the slave holder, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan Allmighty", but only rarely one who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeated", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree with the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still divided racially and economically even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree on his people through sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players that belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approximate it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him in the evening and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found out when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's transferred, and I felt that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be a different person.
Matt Damon portrays in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual role models, under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeatable" he has received positive reviews and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the magazine Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good history, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secrecy over Norway dissolved: the Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed across Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only yesterday admitted that not far from the Norwegian border, an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which was originally the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the premiere, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers, they already write about "Bulva" as over a " rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine probably exploded at the third level of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which ran under the waters of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an undetermined flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
This time the generality has kept itself against it and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missiles did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In previous cases the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the Ministry of Defence's management considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulva" will fly once without problems and will carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of not more than 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself again at 51 years in a professional ice hockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup intaker helps his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and is likely to take off already in Friday's duo KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defenseman.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some of the remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, put up co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest professional ice hockey game in Russia after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to take advantage of 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two gold medals, seven World Championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over the head in Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey starroom.
Hyundai gave up the trade unions. All overtime are abolished
The management of the Nosovice Automobilfabrik Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Because of often arranged overtime, the trade union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesperson of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
But the management wants to agree with the trade unionists over a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two working shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive it in the aftermath for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime allowance or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek went on.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees are paid the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of trade unionists who had stopped production last week, yesterday afternoon the management decided with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign a joint document to meet the demands, they will be prepared to lift the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automotive factory was tense when about 400 employees sprang spontaneously because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management held, however, that employees had to make overtime to meet automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions call for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, this year they demand to pay the fee of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Serial production was started in the company last November.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘steel’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact predominates against the disadvantage that the connection to common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the patient can prolong his life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of virus proliferation results in the development of resistance viruses that are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances known as metalocarborane act on the protein responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in ways other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists have developed new “improved” connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Hectic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by the HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the virus propagation in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changed.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease is tested in the test tube, including against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as on the clinically used medicinal products but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants against which the medicines used are often effective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical designs, makes the metalocarborans interesting for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Disputes over budget. ODS went on Fischer, it resists
The president of the ODSs, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "grey" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its further existence.
The President of the Minister referred to the expression of the ODS as "strong statements".
It is said to be time for analysis.
The vice-president, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil service cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit or whether it is his absence at the office with the help of the left-wing Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, and Necas pointed this out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, although with link-party amendments more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for public employees, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has held back the proposals of Social Democracy that it conceals the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with arrears of 163 billion crowns.
The ODSs have left the Chamber before the vote, so they have complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget programme. Frase not clear
Disillusionment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government was still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments would have been accepted, the situation would have been different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up for Monday after the government business at the Premier.
In doing so, he suggested that he consider his further absence in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the guise of the budget.
The extent to which fishermen speak out for the future budget deficit, according to Necas, the Nominants of Social Democracy (CSSD), who enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also state clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or to the reform of the Staff Regulations.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not err
That's what the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government is about.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from fighting against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the majority of the left who are currently in Parliament".
Then he is said to be unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be up to date, then I will deal with it, said the Secretary of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the citizens' Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS left at the premiere's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODSs would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday, if the Prime Minister specifically asked the members of the citizens' Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not little children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODSs were not forced back in political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party president in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, it would be about Bolshevist Parliament and destruction everything would be positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will drive for about the same fare.
The Czech railways will be closed or restricted from 13 December to a few less loaded trains and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new roadmap.
Most tariffs incl. base and customer fare are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, are given to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of type Pendolino.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also drive on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections will be reduced from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
Among the biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
This is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distances to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will drive at a time of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers can no longer drive to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's Regional Railway Account: 200 million increase
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion kroner for the next year to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity, just like this year. The local trains will provide the districts, in total they will pay eight billion kroner next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains cost 200 million Czech kroner.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has re-completed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it did not accept the price increase for the large majority of the tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day online licenses CD Net and with low-cost Internet licenses eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militant captures more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the agency AFP, which initially only informed more than 65 abductors.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
There was a kidnapping in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants reportedly used the hostages as living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to publish the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the Arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindaao, the law was imposed on 57 people for the recent massacre.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, which was assembled with the election to the Governorate, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Phillippin province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday they resumed peace negotiations with the Philippine Government.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods enters the American cinema "Invictus: The Unbeatable", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been won by Morgan Freeman, who had already been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon has won the side-playing role of the legendary South African champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's start, reactions from critics and the public are also heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993, together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when, on the one hand, in South Africa, the preparations for the World Cup culminate, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive, despite numerous reservations about the occupation of the major roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could receive his energy, as they say, in the interview he performed after the premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get into Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it concerns everyone, he added.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portray the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and ethnic groups for years and years, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the world cup field, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of the grass in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience, thereby gaining the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring people together to become a single people, led the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show that.
The white South Africans, however, are sceptical, as told in recent interview for LN Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for more than 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching plant at the municipality Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Force, Lukas Marvan, six units were attacked.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is erased with a mixture of water foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer in-house closure.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not endanger the safety operation of the management system according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will be more accurate only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one in accordance with Mandatova.
For over 10 years there has been nothing similar with the company Ceps, errors like this are rare, added it.
The power supply was not interrupted in accordance with the spokesperson of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, due to the fire of the Trafostation was not affected by the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovated and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises criminal charges for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute intview in the radio journal.
The complaint is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, and we have only presented the offer over the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were closed last week.
So there is nothing left of us but to fight us.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all the districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the collection of the criminal ad will continue the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society and for his own person.
I am of course prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and to do so I am also calling for other leaders.
I assume that on this issue too it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railway traffic and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the bad step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign opened Jancura after the districts agreed to operate the regional railways with the Czech railways and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
He was already threatened by a member of the CSSD because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura.
The only threat was if we didn't give up that we could lose the bus licenses as well.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, today Jancura told the radio journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Immunization against pneumococci will change the habit from January.
It should be the first free and voluntary family.
But now votes are reporting that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Institute of Medicine has already determined the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received any vaccinations.
Those who have already started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further re-infusion.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between 3 and 5 months of life of the child.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus last year.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine cans spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all the children's vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to 10 years of age after examination in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcus was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, this is to be paid by insurance companies and voluntary.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsky mentioned the head of the civil association Nahlas.
His association has long been pushing for pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference, where our association was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the specialized society of practical pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about reducing the number of re-vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination has been started as a voluntary one," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcus next year.
Immunisation against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is paid by health insurance as the first area vaccination and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova injured.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this concerns the practical pediatricians involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same path as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that the insurance companies could "execute the money from the health insurance system".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy and wait the vaccines themselves until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, each practical doctor will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That won't be easy at all, Cabrnochova says.
US artist son involved in "Museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of wanting to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police Department, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken in his vehicle with a trailer at the invitation of 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist stopped at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police oath, Frazetta Junior, that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta was refusing to grant any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and cutbacks announced in the Wertat report against the criticisms of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling had made an opportunity "to perish" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The chancellor also found himself in favour of targeting low and medium-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cut-off limit on public wages for 2011.
Social security schemes
On the other hand, the trade unions protested that low wage recipients were being punished for a recession that they did not cause and warned of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion pounds a year - has annoyed the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic upturn.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
GROUNDS FOR THE PROBLECT REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%.
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
Rejected 1 percent increase in corporate tax for small enterprises
Tax losses on electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in public pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates from the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be 90 pounds a year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be about 190 pounds poorer, while a person with £10,000 will be richer by £110.
Ministers said that their objective of the deficit elimination by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall to 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit half-life and this is also absolutely necessary over the period of the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Forecasts of the Labour Party on the future economic growth – which affects the extent of the debt re-indebtedness and the speed of the deficit-debtedness – were challenged after the Treasury had been forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the decrease by 3.5% predicted in April - while the debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than predicted previously.
Missed opportunity.
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the Labour "shoulder crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how to repay it and press "Cynic" for difficult decisions until after the elections - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything important about what they were going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass".
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police should be kept out of future cuts, unlike in the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit reduction coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money generated by tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the expenses for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements - like the above-mentioned inflation adjustment at some invalidity pensions next April - the treasurer would suspend the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Holy Eat"
Although ministers have not announced any dinner details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be felt in the medium term.
The recognised Institute of Tax Investigations said that the numbers of the Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant at the economic audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow preliminary report. Markets are aware of this."
FBI investigates arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens due to the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan announced to the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigated whether these are the same men who last month were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges that are being accused of them and under which circumstances they are being held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesman Katherine Schweitz said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are really the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house earlier and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Reuters' news agency reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty Sentences "Missages" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International human rights organisation, it is still as bad in Iran as in the last 20 years.
The report details "missing patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the greatest road protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
There were dozens of prison sentences and prosecutors who said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC-Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse claims acknowledged and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting against the election results.
"They hit me more often in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty announced.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner, who said that he had been detained in a prison in Kahrisak with 75 more than eight weeks in a container.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the disturbances after the elections and the reactions of the government to them, but so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark into a competition pist.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 half-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump slope at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glittering below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art or tricks executed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
She and we are still there.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban on minarette and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most secularized societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that divided the country over a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Bowen's newest book offers a wider and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives up debates between teachers and students on the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a sentence-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanity issues, he claims, which make up everyday life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arabic-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly disunited with their salafi counterparts – the proconsuls of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – which nowadays shows a small but influential presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of Church and State) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced a more harsh treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He is more aware of a "strengthening of the value screws" than of growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Restless Outlook of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she recognizes melts at alarming speed and takes life with her that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have gone into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
In the complicated history and politics of the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old Fähnrich to the lake, who fought only with the rifle piston of his muskets, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a performance.
Even today zoos still typically have a millionths of the life of a wild living old animal. The climate is rarely suited: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, laying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-slide-driving Inuit use powerful storm rifles to get their prey to the line.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a captivating insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of the changes appropriately.
This is not a lack of explanation, however.
The pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries had for the first time imagined the confusion of the Packeisen.
Undersea boats so much during the Cold War the shifting ridge while underpassing.
A useful supplement are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson throws a glance into the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater inlets, which are compressed during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... we could be"
Marine infantry was among the 6,000 people who settled in Arlington Kräze
De'Angello Robinson, who was released, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier whom he had never met.
For him and the other Marine infantry who made the journey of Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (cracking all over America), which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves on the Arlington Cemetery, in areas on the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she had made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back something that the victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War I and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they were not visited as often as the later graves, the organizers said.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held their hands while they carried the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck to each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white space cards, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before the grave of her son.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of Marine Infrattery Petty Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell into battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been long, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States Department of Interest in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on December 5th.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the charge of the "fence".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities that include easy protests and critical writings pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the communist government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The arrest message was first reported on Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasises that the United States will provide a counter-benefit if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average merit of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and they are used to send text messages, as a 15-minute telephone call would cost a day's pay.
Internet usage is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access is restricted to too many websites.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, said Gloria Berbena, the U.S. interest representative in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently issued a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the appointment of Raul Castro as leader of the country that replaced sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and arrested within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives discover plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to expose an extensive network of terrorist candidates who seek out the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them out because one of them had given comments on terrorist attacks on YouTube on the website.
Saifullah, after arriving in Pakistan, became the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was taught about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to subdivide the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who, because of the sensitivity of the matter, wanted to remain anonymous.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men who are still in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI underlines the decisive role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to accommodate human asset items within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as doorkeepers who do not allow those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American potential recruits are subjected by A Kaida to a special test, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years as to whom they are allowed access, because the U.S. secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
When you try to put someone in these groups, what better way could you go than following the recruitment model that so many have followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday demanding bolder action on climate protection by the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On one day, when the climate negotiations sponsored by the UN did not go much, thousands of activists with transparents wandered through the city where there was in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to contend with because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - in order to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no more way to get around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Danish law prohibits these actions in the event of demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, close to which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they began as rockets, but then were followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent racial slump
The mathematics certificates last week were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country, producing top performances, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth classes in the past have made two years faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the stubborn power gap between African American and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average number of white quadruples from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but only three points increased from 209 to 212 in the last two years.
The power gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American eight-klässler remained basically the same, it fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And even though the number of points reached by children in both groups has increased in this period, the difference has now hardly diminished by 58 points.
Some of the teachers of the district expressed their concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students, who are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall evaluation by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the board of directors of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that takes action for equality of education in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Councillor, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Eaton primary school.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the examination points is that the secondary schools of the city urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend almost the time and energy we need to use for our secondary school.
Rhee said that the district needs to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performance students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school career and which are significantly behind their same age-old classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that draws attention from kindergarten to sixth class games and life-saving experiences, was brought to Washington under former headmaster Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to give the best measures to students below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools that are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political repercussions that are working against this important item of the agenda.
The weak point is, of course, as with other city school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington to compete with Charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, Janey said, who with his teacher's union last year came to an agreement over 185 days a year, which he considered "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the attitude of the other eight-courses of the group, the Gettysburg explore, where teaching costs 38,690 dollars per year, was more a fearful visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college training needed to get up in the middle class.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano-Americans completes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But consulting programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to get to college, especially when these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then at some point a single measure will not solve the problem, Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supporting network from preschool to high school.
The federal program, which Gracielas College-Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn one gang up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, since 1999, the programme has helped more than 10 million students, over 60% of whom have attended college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil concluding contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to restore its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only company that has given a bid has withdrawn the shortlist.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of the American oil molts at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq has finally opened its doors and instead of US companies, Asian and Europeans are giving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the withdrawal of the US military, have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more closely in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to face risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been on the side side with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts signed this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil minister, Assam Jihad, that China is about to become one of the great world economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its competitors and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
The bids for pre-selected companies were given, which were then compared with the price per barrel of oil, which the Ministry was willing to pay, in order to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the case of an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top deployment planer of Al Kaida is expected to have been killed this week, so reported representatives of the US anti-terrorism campaign on Friday.
This would, if it were confirmed, be the second deadly attack on a high leader of the terrorist organisation this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region, were supposed to have been killed by a number of rockets that met their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents who are suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US anti-terrorism campaign showed undetermined evidence that Somalis were among the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of the Al Kaida, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, noted an executive officer who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate character of the US-American air raids on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and turned them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalis rose quickly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban leaders who have been killed since September, than were killed in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organisation, dropped from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, the steps taken to reduce their responsiveness and, at the same time, brutally kill suspicious informants, the page reported.
Leading UN Messenger in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leading UN Messenger in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, thus ending a stormy term of office, which was suppressed by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eide's departure takes place when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he was supporting the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. schedule for military withdrawal, which should begin in 18 months, could induce other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he is not laying down his office, but only fulfilling an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to notify UNO-
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so he can have time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he's better off looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has taken into account the Swedish-Italian-style Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously conducted UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and putting aside evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "have undoubtedly caused damage to the mission, because already there was a great deal of scepticism in relation to international interference in the election".
Eide said that he had recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the relief measures of the US-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow its successor to recruit more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the insurmountable UN regimes have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I have been able to set up only one person since May, so he said.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defense Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defence Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be subject to "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not take part in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for choice, he said in response to the question of a soldier to the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, which is incorruptible to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanction package aimed at Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendous sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion from the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government has joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that nuclear technology is to be acquired only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has urged this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
Mr Gates said that Iran simply left the international community in relation to some of the proposals which they had already agreed to at the beginning of October, openly stated that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, had brought together in a way that they had never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set the 31st of Dec. as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to follow other options, including those referred to by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion issued in New York, Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members on Thursday and said that they are ready to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates forced both sides to lower the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse the Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Change in rates in the Elderly China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters, which gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave."
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course in this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No way".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child nothing is left, says Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, abandoned single children, who are affectionately called "little emperor", a population crisis in the country brings up.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN
Population issues department, whereas the number of population groups aged 60 and over in 2020 should rise from 16.7 per cent of the population to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies in order to "help to reduce the proportion of older populations and to alleviate the labour shortages of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial option that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed this policy to the fact that the critical stress on natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women who had a child to leave.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions carried out, creating an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
Over the past few years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they accepted more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters who taught families to have only one child were replaced by directives almost overnight, describing in detail who comes in question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to pass through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice to those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Distressing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that an upturn is to be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts, however, do not report any change.
As an example, only four to five applications are received per month at the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city expected for 2010 will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and this was also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, Yang said, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we have the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples state psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want this."
Chen Zieian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it outragedly.
For parents from the middle class with double careers through which the birth rate drops, he said, it turns out to be successful and for that one must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20 to 39 years grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group drafts emission reduction plan
The climate conference funded by the UN -- which so far was characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- once again focused on Friday with the publication of a document, which records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations having to raise the biggest loads in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as important progress in a negotiation that is due to take place, as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries in order to master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the global temperature rise limit should be, which the policy makers would bring.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, managing representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the foundations of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given a boost to discussions on Friday by ensuring that, over the next three years, it will provide USD 3.6 billion per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from masters of floods and droughts to prevention of deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks brought, which the discussions had determined in the last week.
The U.S. climate expert Todd Stern has rejected formulations requiring binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is going a tougher line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies and taking action, so Star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister He Yafei's statement, which said that there was either a lack of "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" for the leading American climate negotiator that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States of China would not help financially to master global warming.
The future economic cruising of the great world powers is at stake, and there have been breakages both within the industrial nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle refers equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the saving of the planet, in which China and the United States committed themselves because of their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have gone over to more aggressively deal with countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who is also a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change reported that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The alliance of 43 small island states presented a 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "has been exerting political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center at meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to put down claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people every day enter and out at the congress center, guitarist-playing activists organize night-time shows in which they joke about the countries that, in their opinion, betray and sell themselves, and draft contracts are passed on by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are here and from Wednesday onwards, 60 will be heads of government in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Politics of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train defines the Monday feeling new
On Monday morning at 5 p.m. a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train exit that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras during its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent and 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link the UK to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the change from aircraft and car to railway would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three big parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battles and fears about environmental damage could still slow down the British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present to the government a feasibility study, Lord Adonis will present the report on December 30, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network planned.
The new railway line to connect London with the West Midlands will pass with a margin of five metres to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters of the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to it in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards Northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said one railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would enable travellers to reverse the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes compared to a little over an hour today.
The drafts offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 persons can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in service per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that in London a final station would be needed on which 20,000 passengers per hour could be delivered.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should, in his opinion, be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to change from high-speed routes to existing railway lines in the north of Birmingham, thus continuing to travel between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive knock-off point in order to ensure a change from aircraft to train, a target for rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds orangerie of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading house member of the Conservatives, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the costs of an orangery that he was reading in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complains that under house members have to live “by lean rations”, has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak timber factory at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people responsible for the under house approved the applications at that time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditures of the lower house members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest under-house members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control office of the under house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he grew a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "Glasshaus für Entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privilegies during a recent study of his previous mortgage contracts to take an opinion on the increase in money.
Last month, following an examination of its expenditure, the Committee released it from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security of a mortgage over 271.406 pounds (300.000 euros) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month by March last year as mortgage interest.
In April its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal rateless RBS hypothecic interest decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the Unterhaus show that Duncan continued to claim 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as an opposition leader of the Unterhaus, after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that Members of Parliament would live "by lean rations".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live by lean rations and be treated like S***e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and have claimed a small part to disappear, measured by what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked for his expenses in May when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered "excessive demand".
An activist, as a protest in Duncan's lawn, dug a hole in the form of a pound sign after he had become aware that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by the Fees Office, as well as subsequently by Legg for an increase in the value."
He added: "There is no debate about avoiding and slipping or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be any cleaner and clearer."
Come all her believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free Glühwein and traditional Mince Pies, with dried fruit stuffed pastries.
The so far selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion until Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Change Conference, increasing world mobilization contributes to climate change, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your assessment, between 600 and 700 people, mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has captured the conditions under which hundreds of militant followers had been arrested "without distinction", sharply criticised, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "still detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seat position.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers with candlelight for an evening, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators have arrived with busts and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for the "clima justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a recovery of the ecological debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on and say, "We have time," said Angelique Kidjo, Benin's singer.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, the figure of the globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link up "climate justice and social justice": "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific space, where many islands are particularly endangered as a result of warming, has given the start for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, approximately 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were a few hundred people, mostly students who were marching in red, and they hated Bandanas in which you praised solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (Southern), in Lille (Northern), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, denounced Georgia that it is a "stitch".
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "stitch".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgia war of August 2008 for control of the South-Ossetian area, another Georgian seclusionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 pm GMT.
Electoral participation was around 58% a few hours before the election session, according to the Abkhazian Election Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a lucrative total occupation, has explained his press spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is occupied with Russia.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, several thousand people died, Abkhazia wishes to prove by this choice that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Lord Bagapch.
She was one of the electorate who was elected to a polling room that was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district manager, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm-hearted welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular as regards the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, replied and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as those in which Abkhazia Russia leaves control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the present government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated throughout the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Kaufhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to deploy, about 700 people, have arrested an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries until the 18th of December who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers with candlelight for one evening, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators dressed in black and armed with brick and hammers began to slam discs, a journalist of the AFP noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have encircled you immediately and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people were arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent splitter groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the East of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents, in which about twenty people were temporarily arrested by the police. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," explained the spokesman of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the forces of order were in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or by car from German capitals, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going on the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say : We still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that devour, there are streams through which you can run, which used to be the case."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opponents has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French MEP José Bové, a critic of globalisation, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organisation Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming has given rise to demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50,000 people have gone on the road.
In Manila some hundred people, in the majority of students, have made red dressed with Bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy advertising.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350", several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday's journal "Journal du dimanche", the national minister of education Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not compulsory taught in the terminals (12th year).
"The pupils of the Première (11th year of school) now have all four hours and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", for after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific", he continued. He underlined: "I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals who would have objected to the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the state project of removing compulsory teaching in history and geography in the S (12th year of school with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question about limiting the philosophy of the programme of terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which in their opinion the educational training of future teachers falls victim.
The Minister concluded that they were subject to a specialist fitness examination in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year to an approval examination which examined their teaching skills.
They also conduct internships during the year in M2 and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships you have offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours that you have spent before the students, that is, more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "case that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supériere"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit : this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences in which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One would like to do something to reach people and awaken the feeling of wanting to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years of age and one of the organizers of this day, on the verge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to fish in the school pool.
"Amongst the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even according to their charisma", he specified.
"Climate warming allows you to speak for hours, but the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke for about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the audience might learn from the fact that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school side from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Depreciation of payments : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, trade unions called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budget reasons by January were transferred before Christmas days.
The 2nd Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on employees who have no service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday morning in front of the Criminal Enforcement Office in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is up to them".
The 3rd Trade Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite for a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and the Sunday and holiday supplements will be marketed in December as "disgusting and unacceptable".
The first union of criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Penalty Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilisations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Enforcement Agency and the Ministry of Justice declared that overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the criminal officers, which guarantees that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well how to keep the staff's efforts to keep our criminal justice system operational and modernise," the Minister of Justice states.
"I have instructed the criminal enforcement body to take immediate action so that such a situation, which was caused by the lack of appreciation of overtime, does not recur in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "household constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is indignant and announces to boycott "all assemblies and convocations" until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being placed on us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT trade union.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, according to UFAP Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes Christmas better than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has chatted out at the TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he will always distribute better gifts than he himself gets.
In a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening over the ABC channel, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama confirms, adding that the dog also gets a gift of course.
Michelle Obama decided to reject her husband's claims about the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nods the president.
"So please," he slammed them smeltically and pointed to the pearl chain of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
While this one-hour radiance in an informal atmosphere with the well-known TV moderator, who had supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bicycle and also a basketball game that his father, whom he very rarely saw, had brought with him for Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"First much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball of him."
The First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL confirms that he was transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles after an operation in France due to significant "damages". According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was transferred to the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was once again operated at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday, after the American doctors "damages caused by the operation of a disc incident" which he suffered in Paris on November 26 said his production company in Paris, which added that these damage would have required a new operation.
Nevertheless, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, however, Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma to avoid "shaking and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, did you have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient than he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it emerges" that after its first operation in Paris "no Drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc incident.
The surgery was planned for several days by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After Johnny Hallyday's operation, the singer was delivered to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley", but he assured him that "no worries" were needed to make the rock musician because he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was nonsense to put himself on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "reacting well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was suppressed".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July, after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small cancer of the intestine" which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, as planned, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
Only in mid-November did the persons surrounding him have to re-enter the hospital.
Euro-2009/Course Railway: First place for Bousquet about his favorite distance
The Francose Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, took an international title about his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were last allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
One record has been improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 metres and the other by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record on the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatians Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in this case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane inserts, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
This time the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has won the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Zola grave plate estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which was discovered by the French writer Emile Zola, was valued at US$1.5 million on Thursday, according to the artist Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century after Christ and has always been rated with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the dionysus are depicted in a socialist architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heinz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday versus the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is certainly what the buyers have so far offered most," says Sotheby's spokesman, Dan Abernethy, to the AFP.
The discovery of this marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she showed up a piece by piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Earth of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible, after the coup government had rejected this guidance as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation that took place at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that one disagrees with the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft set up by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its starting point.
The Putsch government wanted to require M. Zelaya to resign and to seek political asylum for him abroad.
However, the indignant president rejected this because he wished to return to Mexico as a welcome, occupying head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by trying to give me up at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign," said M. Zelaya to Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has been speaking to Radio Globo since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the agitated president who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the guise of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, had declared against the Honduran Radio HRN.
I did not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the Telesur channel, which is based in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only be the president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of an exit from M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the followers of the agitated president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around them, and the army there had strengthened his efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the popular inquiry he organized to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had come back surprisingly on September 21st and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves these, he will be detained for high treason, if he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the disputed election, Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argenini or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in the upturn, US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange has concluded with a high level on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance show that the shares in the United States and their partners are recovering: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67 %, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the stock exchange closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market is focused only on "half-glasses", so it was moderate.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the American trade balance, which "is an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, the analysts expected a deficit increase.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners in the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on the business research economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the state of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new jobseekers during the last four weeks was "at the bottom of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds at 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to the 3,432% on Tuesday night, the profitability of bonds at 30 years to 4,492% compared to 4,408% on the night before.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power whistle out "Damen in Weiss"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans, standing on Cuban power, picked up the wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day from political prisoners and also destroyed another rally, a good dozen dissidents being temporarily arrested.
Around the forty "Damen in Weiss", wife or next-to-be political prisoners, were picked out on open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just when they were on the foot march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There are Fidel and Raul!", the powerful partisans with raised fists were scanning against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana on the night before, when neither injured nor arrested.
In the Vedado district, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also took part in the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian policemen, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the dissidents who were disfellowshipped by the Partisans of the government, under the use of force, have forced them to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" have organized an unapproved march for the "bite for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list is about 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband is Hector Maceda, declared a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are sitting behind bars.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "students" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and counter-revolutionaries that took place on Thursday.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of curbing rights and freedoms, in particular by the freedom of expression.
Crazy kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more persons.
According to the first survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police statements, with witnesses present.
The old man, born in 1929, is responsible for the police syndicate Alliance in the hospital for the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has prebbled a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the threesome, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person hovers in danger of life, as it appears, according to police sources, vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized by a police source in the state of shock.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police statements, should immediately be on the road, the parallel boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passersby, apparently by chance: a thirty-and-a-four-year-old, the latter of the two hard.
The scenario stayed in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a controller of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passersby, including young people, are supposed to have tried, according to the AFP's witness reports, to banish the mad.
I saw a guy in the threesome with a green vest.
Three young people tried to move.
They couldn't because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell on him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Two city policemen, including their superiors, have always tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife strokes, so police figures.
The event has taken place in one of the main strikes of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to tell me that there's a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in first aid position and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
Forces of the state police have finally arrested the man who did not carry identity documents.
Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Attorney of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to clarify the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out being sent to a mental institution.
According to another police source, six police officers were deputising him at the Clichy Police Commission, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces free themselves during the Tathergang".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski, on Thursday, repeatedly asked in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to bring down the prosecution of his clients, who are currently in court at his residence in Switzerland for more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", accused three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California of serious procedural errors at the time of negotiation in 1977.
I demand criminal proceedings, M. Hummel explained before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the case at the time of the trial, "let him run down the back coldly."
According to him, before he dropped his judge's verdict, the judge had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and disired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the inquisitive prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "been".
If the Court of Justice refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests the leadership of a process which would enable him to provide evidence of his argument.
The defendant repeated, in its turn, the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the termination of the actions brought against the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years old.
He hasn't travelled to the United States since then.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski must be "there to attend the trial".
If you want to spread the message in this matter not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, which escape is a way out?, Mrs. Asayma asks.
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the termination of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the termination of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the affair Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his Chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and ends without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday without a course in a market between better indicators than the US and a rise in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available in closing, Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has scored 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37 % (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Truly, the market is quite quiet," said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that this will remain this way by the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended, which "have contributed to improving the market view of the solidarity of the recovery of the economy", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
Sales in the US increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months in succession and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared with 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, thus reducing '' the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thereby lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The return on the bond over 10 years rose by 3,540% on Wednesday evening from 3,482% and the bond over 30 years was 4,497% compared with 4,492% on the previous day.
Miss World elections again in South Africa
After a month's tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last hurdle of Miss World on Saturday to realize their dream: to be chosen for the most beautiful woman in the world and this in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already met their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected as Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true hustle of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply extraordinary.
I've seen a lot of things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with a lot of enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 5 p.m. (15 o'clock Central European Time).
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathing landscapes".
After one month of Galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now concentrates on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both were Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I would like to come home with the crown, Miss India inaugurates with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidate women delve into traditional costumes and not to forget, in bathing suit.
The performance is presented by a television moderator, Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is to receive the world with a hardly overwhelming warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates have made a safari to visit the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted bicycles and local cuisine.
But quite extraordinary was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand.
Not usually for a head of state, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory, however, will undoubtedly remain the release in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Football Championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get anywhere else.
I will surely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured him on Friday on his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all going very well, David Hallyday of the press explained when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock (21 o'clock MEZ).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would go to the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer "was transferred this night in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in order to ease his severe pain and carry out his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo an operation again at night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last intervention.
On Friday morning his wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French gymnasium in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP noted.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatic surgery in the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told he did the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were totally upset, Mr. Camus explained.
I've heard that you might start a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled too fast and with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I made a personal phone call to this doctor who assured me that he saw this journey as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without Drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trentignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine in which he practised at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleed.
However, he is also a doctor with dubious reputation who has been convicted several times because of failed operations and not to forget, because of tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical Board, has called him "a man without a loophole" who has to be "regularly" in front of the board of directors and "all other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
This explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage", he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have been raging since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF Party Alliance (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
On Friday, the party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party, strongly reacted to a takeover attempt by the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the side of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him to use this seal no longer on any document, in the face of a judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believed that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had delivered his hand to the left.
By the way, the defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In response to his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la proprété industrie" in 2004.
However, the office of François Bayrous's friends, under the supervision of UDF's political alliances, broke their silence and made it clear that they were not absolving themselves and placed a period of time for the Minister and the MP to stop using this seal and transfer it to them the property rights of the brand.
In the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist Alliance.
You probably also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF+, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the office of UDF explained and asked the party NC to "remove from all material and (their) website without mentioning the name UDF".
Hervé de Charette also called for "the ownership of the brand to be transferred to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter they stress that "UDF "since 1978 is a full political movement and remembers that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave these 2007 to create a competing movement, as it had done in other 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
According to the Signatory, the Nouveau Centre Party has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he had not been a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF, in order to do this for himself.
You will also remember that this carelessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "In politics as well as life, it seems more dignified for us to make a name for ourselves, rather than trying to get out of anonymity, by falsely taking on a name that you do not have any legal rights."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for exploiting weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he had exploited a weak moment of the eighties in order to sneak up on some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible for the exploitation of weaknesses in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, for a crime committed with a maximum sentence of three years and a penalty of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga one of France's richest families, where mother and daughter are fattened and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
So far, the herbin and main shareholder of L'Oréal have refused to undertake such an investigation, especially not under the conditions provided during the investigations of Nanterre's prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before 10 March 2010 stating clearly whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have found himself in a state of weakness.
I think she'll be conducting these investigations.
I'll talk to her, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent novelty (...) The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, accusing him of exploiting the weaknesses of her mother for years in order to sneak up on donations of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she was suspicious of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier once to twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage".
Nanterre's prosecutor's office is once again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because a court judge has in recent days refused to initiate a judicial protection procedure against his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," confirmed Marie-Christine Daubigney, the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the procedure for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French company, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been free of charge ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best, as it was earlier to hang on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the heart of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again and again!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&E and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economics = Economic Intelligence) calls for "proactive action by all parties involved and a forward-looking approach"; it claims that its employees are committed to an action that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist of equalizing employees in the centre of the company's concerns alongside the customer.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could find that, in the face of a new situation after many reasons, the whole structure finally comes to do what it always did.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power- proportionally increases the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most executives have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Previously from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behavioral theory, recently reactivated by the American "Neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "hebel" (sic) to employ employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to adopt a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambition and their projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a specified doxa, which allows them to assess the company’s perception of its image, what it offers them to achieve their goals of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management in the right place.
They create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American rights welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who ridiculed the award to Obama on October 9 this time applauded the President's speech, the example of the former vice-president's candidate in the 2008 elections to Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the US Today daily newspaper, and added that she herself spoke about the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way of explaining his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I felt this speech was entirely historical, said Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The previous MEP, who is regarded by some as a possible candidate for Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not afford a price for peace if the use of force would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition, he is a "cosmopolit", as "he always does," he has "spoken like an American president," when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and do not do much for their protection", says Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a falke of Era Bush, spoke on the National Review Online website as "difficult, loud and uninspired".
On the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal from the armed forces.
Packing the war under the guise of justice, the massacre can easily be justified against the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseworthy on the part of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded in advance to Obama, described the speech itself as a speaker like him, known for his talent, as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "daughter and exemplary at the same time".
Remote driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening ending the strike command and the threatening heavy supply link at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State, Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, welcomed the agreement which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators parted early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And that although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had abandoned the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused the company a lot of damage" and "it was to be feared that he would interfere with the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block supply centers anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some contradictory ones who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
Mr Grillot, President-in-Office of the TLF, spoke of a "good agreement", although "it was difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect of employees", says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the total road transport rate in the first half of 2010, which will enable, in particular, to address the issue of the 13th monthly content and the modernisation of the tariff agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the contributions for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the 2009 draft law on the adjusted finances adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" Senate vote.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be first applied to the undertakings affiliated to the organisation and then applies in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the whole profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association called for "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million "has already been promised to the sector to compensate for some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to get rid of the Gans-Eser on the coming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "is threatening to build a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed network in France for the Greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on weekends, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration) continues to await strikers with their demands for wage increases.
There were no trains at this important shopping week before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central track (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was available only one of four trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to change.
The Galeries Lafayette department store, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business in a technical way".
The RER A line runs through the Paris ballroom from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains went on schedule at the main traffic time, and almost none during the poor traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the platform because the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye station (Yvelines) was much less overrun than otherwise, mainly because of the lack of gymnasiums.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have "began up an extra hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to care for passengers by staff and officers, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks in the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at/from Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "necessary" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was indignant that RATP itself put its pay proposals in brackets and stressed that the management's "it is not possible to solve a problem, while this was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday to be held for the "extensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "despites the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 riders visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the lead point that until now rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand after a pre-announcement of Unsa and Indépendants to line RER B.
The associations demand a pay supplement of 120 (Ussa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). Moreover, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of passengers are travelling daily.
The riders of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, earn a gross wage from 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary of 600 to 650 euros for shift services and Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision followed immediately by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, trying to reach the hand of the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The party for a democratic society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes being required to impose the resolution. Moreover, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the Chairman Ahmet Türk and the MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political action for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity, the Turkish and Tugluk enjoying, as well as the confiscation of the Party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The party leaders argued before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Attorney General of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "Weisungen" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection with the PKK, but refuses to refer to it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court is in the process between the Government, which is committed to meeting the Kurdish community and proposing a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to put an end to the PKK's support by the Kurds and end the conflicts.
DTP leaders affirm that a resolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the prison conditions of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan have led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in the millions of city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The forces used tear gas grenades and water heaters when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Türk assumed that the court's decision "will further deepen despair".
" Turkey can clarify this (Curdical, Ann. d. Editorial) Question not based on the prohibition of a party," he explained the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closing of the parties on principle.
This will not solve the problems," says Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously make yourself aware of a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service director of the FES.
So that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be this far for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is based on an exact plan.
As soon as it snows across the surface in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-tracks will be run with large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main traffic and transit routes such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with falls, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be distributed with moisture, which is better liable, for a maximum of three hours if necessary.
This is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It'll be difficult if it cuts only at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles".
Only then, if it does not cut any further, are the supply and development roads, to which the Council-Beil-Straße belongs, in turn.
The last priority are side and side roads.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES footsfolk make their way, danger points and transitions are given priority.
In most cases, FES could not take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is given on this fast smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1,50 meters large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle collars and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Science magazine of Thursday.
The animal lived around 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was located at the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they combined the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosauri fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you only find single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current teaching, the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds known as "long-hauls", the four-legged saprods and their relatives, and the plants eating ornithischia (vogelbucken aquariums), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found indications of airbags, as they also have the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge Sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight construction bones, probably the joint ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at that time as supercontinent Pangäa formed a single land mass.
To this end, the fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot stem from a common, immigrant ancestors, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted, because in South America there are simply many primitive dinosaurs preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural vertebrates of the earth’s Middle Ages, it is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight acidifiers and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relationship between the Trias and the Jura died out at the border.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a group of animals, which had also developed in the Trias, had a meteorite impact on the flowering of a group of animals, and since then, a shadow of this kind has been tempting: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are working at the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police room of the occupied casino of Frankfurter Goethe University is beating waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, are cooperating with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, she "disputedly" the police action initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had let the buildings occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike be cleared last week because walls and works of art had been embellished.
Five students were injured.
The material damage, judging the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organised courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The space represents an "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is "deligitimisation and criminalization of protest" and diverts from content.
The Praesidium has absolved itself from the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the workers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Protests Legitimately
The youth of the Verdi and the German Confederation of Trade Unions also cooperate with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the conduct of UniPresident and Police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday at Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU's deputy Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The left has submitted an application calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a highly guarded location for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds had made contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - with the Uniinstituts and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice Mayor, Juri Rosljak, and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt’s Planning Dezernet Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It's about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to contract contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the major companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality had been founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set at all high enough.
For the project's supporters, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Just like that. S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg's capital for a decade into a hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake blocks of a modern rail traffic, since it once took a tremendous amount of time to change locomotives from the back to the front.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
And that's why the stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about half way between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava on the trans-European railways – therefore the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
The S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 80s have long since become incompatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessen and Bavaria to implement the downfall.
Head stations, however, have no access and exit problems anymore, since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and vans at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being approached.
It has been enforced by national and local politicians.
The railway is also involved because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of the taxpayer and not of the state group are borne.
The project can still be reasonably justified by the construction of cities.
It creates new urban space, which - believed to be the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with plenty of greenery.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for the passenger transport to which, typically in the 1980s, huge growth is attributed.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the low-cost flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, the new construction route does not work for freight trains because of heavy climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 also indirectly tangentizes many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian region.
That's the official number.
Experts believe ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is fixed that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the well 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track in the tempo of time.
It would be necessary to press the tube correctly.
However, S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for a night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the VGH judgment, which is more than 400 pages in legal form, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day the VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that in the event of construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-arrange the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as envisaged by the State Government, should not be compatible with the statutory protection of the population from night noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the ruling in revision.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel asked CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered a "wort break".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep your word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "justice and trickery".
An accurate legal examination needs its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
Stefan Müller (FDP) said that we need a legal solution.
Just as they represent the opposition, his group's statements have never been a ban on night flying.
US Banks Pay Help Back
The crisis-shattered US big banks are stripping off their state shackles.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp from a total of $45 billion (some €30 billion) to one blow.
The Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid after a report by the US station CNBC.
The institutions aim to eliminate the restrictions that have been imposed on the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of managerial bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained over 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by departmental sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for the exemption from its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a heavy increase of some 20 billion dollars in its capital, CNBC reported on behalf of circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the managing editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the transmitter can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, director of the ZDF headquarters studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation by the transmitter - officially so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, this proposal should not have been passed on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, a chess candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schätter failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s resignation was a severe defeat for the shafts, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in office.
He had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's messages had lost on duty rates, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was squeezed.
Lastly, even 35 state-laws had intervened in the debate, which valued Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It didn't help anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "now-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal adviser of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "morgenmagazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF external policy; since then head of the ZDF-Mainstadt studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender's election, which was still chosen on Wednesday by the industry magazine Medium Magazin as a journalist of the year.
Koch's counterpart in the board of directors, the minister of the Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that staff proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck was also excluded from the ZDF's supervisory bodies.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended to the Board of Directors with a clever move of chess - by vehemently criticizing the board for this immediately after the Brender elections.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both treasurers could nominate him without loss of face for the post of the editor-in-chief as well as the Board of Directors, without suspecting that he would be in office with a party gangster.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already attributed to the left-liberals.
Studying Is Ruined
Participating success for students: After one year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally decided on Thursday: At a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher Education Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to conduct their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the work load of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Policies and universities also aim to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities both inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural specifications more flexible for Bachelor and Master programmes.
In addition, there should not be any different national regulations.
Fewer tests
Since the start of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university judges have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of exams in part dramatically: "Each module usually completes with only one exam", it says in a 30-page paper that will partially re-regulate the admission of study courses.
With the "clear reduction in the examination burden", said Reinhold Grimm, the Accreditation Council Chairman, a "feeling development should be stopped which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studentability" will in future be "the decisive criterion" in design.
Modules such as content would be "tight to check afterwards" whether "necessary restrictions of students in the choice of
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have "claimed to have room for manoeuvre, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new courses, but also when reviewing existing courses.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all the study programmes have been reviewed.
There are ten accreditation agencies in charge of the accreditation board set up by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had called on the countries in October to influence the agencies so that the matter is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual Länder, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate committed additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The aim of the money is to set up universities, in particular tutor programmes, and to strengthen student advisory services, as well as examination and foreign offices.
For this purpose, countries and universities will spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to bring an amendment of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make study design more flexible and to ensure recognition of credits at other universities and facilitate access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all study programmes in the country will be reviewed for their studies.
Government and opposition had again fought on Thursday about study conditions in the country.
Besides praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of Juso-Hochschulegruppen demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "in the future behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the very latest after the educational strike, students should now also "speak a word" as concerned.
The future academics received support from the president of the University Rector's Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Trade Union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough in overall terms: it requires a legal claim that enables any graduate with a Bachelor degree to access a further Master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that there are sufficient Master's degree places available for today's generation of Bachelor students tomorrow with the best possible study conditions, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to set up significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on a freer access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entering into Germany and out is beautiful almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he explores the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he held the legendary poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessische Literaturforum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
On the last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he took care of considerable extra-literary appearances, which included "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its Securitistacts".
Söllner is visibly insecure and exposes a statement in which he performed his work as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In 1989, Söllner received the German Language Prize together with some of the participants.
The application attempts would have started slicing, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "that is, someone who has not resisted the securitate's intimidation attempts."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time as the Nobel-price ceremony for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary discussion with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that makes clear the reasons and the deformity of a political system based on surveillance and speculation.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as you can say according to your knowledge.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession by Söllner of literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut out" in all for him at that time, says Markel.
It was a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner's explanation was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with Romanian intelligence is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The people concerned, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases also knew which clear name was hidden behind the name Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the highly procedurally secure view of the Stasi Acts in this country, handling the legacy of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been remedied and hindered in recent years.
A National Council responsible for the preparation of the Securities Act (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the publication of the files has since been rather sluggish.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, gave an interview in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar expressed herself inadvertently via the prizewinner.
She's got a psychosis, and you only interrogated her once.
The infamy of power meant being able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner is linked to inevitable issues, as is often the case with silent guilt.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The sunken reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire of knowledge rather than by a guilt and shame.
It is more than a footnote to the recovery of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Incentives Champions League
It seemed that there was a well-dressed outdoor clerk from a very nice Christmas party on which a sports item manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, rose a quarter hour after midnight into a herd-called C-Class. ̈
The man with the striking glatz was allowed to chauffeur himself because of the strange city he was still in.
Otherwise he could have driven himself too - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk for luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just get out of here.
In the words of the Swiss commitment only three days earlier: "We have achieved the Eighth Final", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3-1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then it's time to repeat the royal class performance in Mainz in the league all day long.
And the once again revealed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Drach (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Discharge
The 8th final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on December 18th in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminant resistance of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who had given self-confidence, willingness and joy to play to the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I went to the players and told them that they should concentrate on their strengths, and had stopped them to be braver, soul clippers Gross explained the simple sounding recipe for success, which, however, had not been effective under Therapist Babbel.
He has triggered some magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things that you would not have thought possible happen."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week of injury, immediately became the best player in the field, tried to describe the "phenomena" found with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new superior: "He is a man who pervades and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
Under Babbel it had obviously lacked it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency in particular.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overthrew the victory against a replacement-weakened and totally exaggerated defense of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening gave Khedira thought.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although a season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That hero had not been celebrating after three months on his 40th birthday, even after his first home win, was at the events of the weekend, which in the form of a television interviews by Torhüter Jens Lehmann that were broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that the others make and not the Jens, hero countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the board of directors weakness and decided to change the coach to pressure puberty fans.
Also that his free day after play had been deleted, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disapproval.
Lehmann's statements were "depressed by pure egoism", rekindled hero and announced consequences for the final man.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty years.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and militantly strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in the Heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Always provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to version of the WBC.
The judge's judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after the WBC association defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to fight for injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Prior to about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02 metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly escaped the beatings of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive end.
All in all, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had provided some vortexes before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "heavy zombie", who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, when weighing, the champion was moved to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko was also defeated in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of retirement, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "WBC belt", which he had previously had to surrender in battle.
This year he then defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight, I have only one hit and am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the belt of the WBA is the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone Nikolai Waluyev in November.
Haye had previously canceled a September battle against Vitali Klitschko.
His promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz Fall
Frontal attack from the opposition: President of the Green Group Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on Kunduz's air raid, the opposition minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been deliberately deceived.
The Minister said to the deadly bombing on two tank load trains of September "knowably the untruth," said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
They call it rural: He lied.
The order for killing had been issued in disregard of the rules of the International Armed Forces for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg has read, said Trittin.
On Friday it had become known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped truck but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people had been killed or injured in the U.S. air raid requested by the German Kunduz Kommandoor Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, Green, SPD and Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Federal Defence and the News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greene-Collegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's Office did not have any influence on the concrete efforts of the German armed forces in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday too, doubts about the presentation of the ministry about the backgrounds of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had become loud.
According to the information provided by the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg informed correctly and completely about the backgrounds of the tank loader approach.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the background of the two top officials, they announced that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-sided document from the commander of the commander, Klein, and a field fighter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Generale Sonntagszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer yet, it says.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, which intends to establish itself next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in alert condition and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychologically ill and in drug noise do the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we may uninhibitedly indulge in the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in their wake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as special people.
But such images and voices arise not only in psychologically ill or in drug noise.
Debt is our imagination: The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint images or write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to fade.
Dream-like changed awake consciousness states can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic withdrawal states, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is elicited and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great similarity of disorder with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of such a thing".
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comical character.
Its body is two-dimensional and quirky.
The gravity has no power over him anymore, it floats at the room deck.
He's feeling a step.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood red, distorted freckles, flossing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices are ringing out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that slander and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo system, knots them into a loop and fastens them on a hook on the ceiling.
He rises on a speaker and lays down the loop around his neck.
Let's go.
The loop dissolves.
That's supposed to be a lesson for you, yell the voices in a drum-feeling choir, "Go to the hospital and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years back, the first nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, besides he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs, against depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The mirages are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outside world, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice voice is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned is unable to separate important things from the unimportant one anymore, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that stem from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of the event, everything has an impact on it.
At the same time it becomes a passive role, it is overcome by events, as in the dream, and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the delusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why our brain is beating caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional circumstances can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in affected persons.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery as to how the neuronal system is disrupted, which, moreover, will not manifest itself at first for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brains are running hot
The craziest thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get what, says Lübeck's professor of psychology Erich Kasten.
Whether delusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports about hallucinations and scams for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, hallucinate the brain of healthy people.
Hallucinations, says Kasten, consist of memory contents that are normally held back.
They arise when cerebrals, in which sense perceptions are processed, are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is running hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain damage or psychosis.
But also travel, stress, affection, or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gym there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break it may occur that a sleek boy with long, dark hairs appeals to it.
If it answers him, the fellow students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a pimped-up daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
It can even feel its presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other scams aren't real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often the trug images are also a strain.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just introduces a new associate, while explaining mathematical equations for all other listening and visible on the board.
At night, appearances are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and much too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she see the fragrants or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, yell at the characters.
Parents and friends don't tell her anything about them, they'd think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she's been in contact with the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from travel, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is underworked then, and it's even taking care of his conversation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man she calls Papa since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, the reality forms there.
Hallucinations are also images that cause the brain to develop, so they seem so real."
Also nocturnal dream pictures regard boxing as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, the casten advises his patients to value the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologisted, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also contains positive, creative madness is also a work of art from despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneirodic experience form, a special form of traumatized awakening consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experienced person thinks are real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The uneiroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and meaning in an unbearable situation that enables us humans to make their own design ability do not go into nothing of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneirod experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation goes on journeys for days, while his body at the intensive care unit is sentenced to motionlessness.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as bedridden, old man, aboard a train anatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Swallowed by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the alpine firn and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes up completely in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner travels are fundamentally different for Claussen from every dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
Contrary to that, the memories of mental travel are still overwhelming to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience is breaking the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroides, psychosis, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our internal representations of outer reality are also in the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist sums up the box, "may lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can certainly also be enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over the publishing house at 27 years
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children in the long term, he told the SPIEGEL.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Hubert Burda's publisher sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been taken care of.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
One cannot impose 7500 employees on his children if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Management Board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Executive Board of Burda since 1999.
First of all, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, responsibility for the company's assets and after the withdrawal of Jürgen Todenenhofer also came the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign trade, pressure and finances.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to bridge "10, 15 years", Burda says.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Looking at the cases of fate and shaefflers, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure before the downfall: "This always involved families who were infected by a capital search that had been completely speculated and thought they could rise to a huge player.
My strategy was never that.
He didn't have "world power dreams," Burda says.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play with 'Time' in the World League either, these shops have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done recently, which has opened up a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, who provide hair removal with lasers; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Taci, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that emerges through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
To enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while also having a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends on your feet and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen opposite the devices.
Then show you various videos of how to perform your training sessions properly.
The manager of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching exercises) are sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after training your body, you want to stop by the hairdresser salon, Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for regaining the hair spray, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has selected an exaggerated and very complicated decolleté. You can only advise against that.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics on the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed in order to summarise the promotion of the electric car and opinions and measures of the relevant sectors.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also take part in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous community of Catalonia.
These activities include, among other things, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative that ultimately participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesies of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of tranquillity".
In presenting the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government has launched in support of the automotive sector over the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would have a panoramic view of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to produce in Spain in a highly competitive sector in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the growth of this branch of industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's actions to boost demand, in reference to plan 2000E, which will be applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government, this plan allows exhaust gases to reduce by 6% on average the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in the authorisations which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the outer area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally-sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the model Mazda3, which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 emerges from their good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
Furthermore, the wheel's game is excellent.
While viewing the unit, consisting of the instrument panel and the dashboard, Mazda can be found with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are different from the soberness of German automobiles, especially from Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can easily drive by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It emerges through its fineness, through its silent noise, its performance, and through its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort during the gear shift and its low consumption , even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the most sold ones .
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model chosen for the test ride is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the serial equipment.
The series fixtures mainly show the assistant for the RVM, which thus removes the dead angle, but also the controls for the traction and stability, speed control, the light-sensitive inner mirror, the onboard computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-Bluetooth, as well as the chrome-plated 17-inch rims.
Moreover, this version also includes as if it were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD loaders.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is available only with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 Euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 Euros for the sportive model.
However, as a counter-performance at this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest driving pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars beamed, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device with which you can only read its emails, without a possibility to see certain attachments or surf through the Internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea itself is still especially interesting for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company saw the success, it put two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free data service, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for Europe as a whole.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but my experience is that you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the small prints.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole was almost always ignored.
Outside of your own country, you're always afraid to read his emails and that's right.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (though it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariff means that the telephone providers need to slowly, but safely rethink and begin to consider various options as to how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, and its prices include downloading books and further requests on the Internet.
Without vets and no hooks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it one time, namely when you buy it, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek to buy with life-long Internet access, as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I do not expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Even at Barack Obama's entry into office as President of the United States she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models in both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore a slightly embroidered or necklace.
It even goes so far as to appear at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the fabric from which they are made.
She wore a lace dress during her official introduction and a velvet patterned in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and for the second time an endless model, but gold.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was stuck up on this occasion as a hair clip, while the previous one she carried the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems working because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of a study carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women on "The Fertility and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities restricted on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women are working or not, and if so, what kind of profession they are doing.
Those of them who do not do any other work outside the house, work only half-days or have no fixed employment contract, are more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women shift with a firm employment, especially in the public sector, the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49, with a fixed employment, get their first child on average only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that is increased to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only brought her together and the first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar regarding willingness to receive it," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have primary or higher education, were on average mothers of 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time each.
Furthermore, depending on the level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women are already getting married before their first permanent position and their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do exactly the opposite and are looking for a permanent position and then getting married to their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to his widely envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will be the image of different products of the brand and also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The main actor from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous label as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last to join this exclusive club the actress Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkolle von Evangeline in "Lost").
The awarding of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak with in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen as the best model this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) the thirty X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (curzbiography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the Creator's glowing heart.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save from horror or enlightenment.
In addition to the fact that this book is a delicious reading eigenus, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "I found out from reading his pages that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to unwholesome fate, the morality without guilt and innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a captivating poetic humour, without any sense, like the blade of knives that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, which was in jeopardy, in whose flesh emotions united with the pleasure of repentance due to adultery, a spiritual privilege that was in it to enter heaven on the demise of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. This is one of the 8000 peaks in the world literature, one must climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers are always trying again and again."
About William Faulkner: "That was a funny chump.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and again another time he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane scream, which was shouted out of a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo poured into his literary way into the night of the 20th century. This he made on a journey on which he fled before himself and in an address full of violence in front of the worms attacked the afterworld.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: 'The sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port,/the rest after the war,/ after a satisfied life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much greener than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do to destroy the fame of that man so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Violent Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed by her and our dog, our dog is a mixed dog that we picked up from the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then they missed him out of the hot air two footsteps and hurt him with it.
Our disarmament cannot be put into words, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the line.
In addition, the suffocation attack that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacked a dog, he might also be doing the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been barking all day.
Of course, we have returned an ad in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything at all and prevent any prejudices from the start, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our disarmament of the incident has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in the minds of finding a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny about an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of her commitment to road safety, which "is far more than just the design and production of products that are becoming more and more secure every day" and further confirmed that it also contributes to this goal by other actions of educational and informational character.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmet on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because it is always committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles that one of its main objectives must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks increases somewhat again
After almost two years the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12,6 % in relation to 2008, and much more importantly, they are the first growth even after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac Association and the Ganvam Autohandlerverband.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used to compare November 2008 are a particularly poor sales year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in last month, the total approvals in those 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists: descendants of passenger cars, pickups, small transporters, small vans and lighter small vans/cars.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunder in the sky are still most affected by demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100 % of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these restrictions, which are the result of the turnaround of the money gap of credit institutions, need to include additional factors such as the increase in unemployment rates or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of plan 2000E has helped little.
This plan, however, is not only intended for private individuals, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 outlet that cannot exceed 160 grams per kilometre travelled, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is imperative for the state to pay special attention to these small loaders as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car dealer association predicts a similar year for 2010 as it has just been for which it expects a sales failure (in passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19 %.
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As in the case of the ABS anti-blocking braking system and as is the case with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergency situations must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles, a vehicle period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The action decided by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but it can also help to prevent many collisions due to their working methods.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal using the brake strength operated by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to a test commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not come up before the collision to hit the brake pedal and half of them had not stopped with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the brake system, thereby reducing the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car moves back during the brake procedure.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that every 4th accident could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (by radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time it exerts a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts then the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is unavoidable, the brake assistant will exert maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already taught by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected party already gives its consent to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy up Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has from the Russian group Converg back cover, is gaining stronger acceptance.
If none of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the Control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and did manage to make it a lot easier by 80 kilos, with which he now only puts 1,275 kilos on the balance.
In order to create something like this, they left off the automatic foldable roof, which was replaced by a tent screen with a manual drive, so they saved 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so another 7 kilos were saved; by installing sporty bacquet seats once again 12 and with the slight 19-inch rims another five were saved.
Then again, by abandoning the audio system CDR-30, six kilos had been reduced again and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo had reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK double coupling gear, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual gearbox, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
In his driving behaviour, he can only be given the note perfectly.
However, the reduction of its weight did not lead to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time now we have not tried such a small and light model, but at the same time there is a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the necessary time until we give him the commands to shave, slow down, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at Panamera for the first time.
Acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing out or while accelerating again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the highways where we drove with the Spyder Boxster was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that, although we found some of these curves of ice in the morning gray and rolling split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it would otherwise be more rare and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl."
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboratory, despite the many outstanding players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 in the evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples may have contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blue Reds, who from the beginning set to the top of the display panel.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, one could already imagine that they had come on the field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play Barac inside and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further extend their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to emphasize himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" evaluation of splitter had already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the obvious advantage of the break, the game had not yet been decided, and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "hand of Elías", they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning the rudder around (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few matches with safety to get air back and suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made it possible to show on the ad table a resuspension of the distance (54-67), which the host was able to adorn with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves were in bloom in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team and tried to give their team back power through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was put off because of Foul's, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injury prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost out loud in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the Euroliga Group B, and that in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at the indoor game, which facilitated the victory of the Greeks.
The crew from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter the Andalusians were allowed to dream to begin. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts blended with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of his Unicaja, even though the local team with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the signboard to their favor at the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which, due to an action, it had come almost to the beating between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and for which reason both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and left its superiority on both half of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior and the Lithuanian foreplay Linas Kleizas, with its triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A pick-up chase was impossible
The third game district was characterized by many attacks against the Olympics team, which, despite its 19 losses, showed itself superior and even managed to compensate for the difference between the game played in Malaga and 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to weaken.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and exits of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the leadership and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis, there was some hope for 66-57 again.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to take the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
The users of Facebook can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The "How much should you earn?" tool calculates the salaries of the users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are available a form in Facebook that can enter their profession, professional experience, age and city where they work.
Already after one week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish employee on average feels "badly paid", explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through his search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French one 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros that a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is the one waiter with an annual EUR 11,592 net; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and the work of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most popular places on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has resigned from office must leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest if his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate to the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before this date he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My point of view is to go as soon as possible, logically with the government's recovery from Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on November 29th (at which Porfirio Lobo emerged as a winner), Zelaya assured him that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
This, however, failed to acknowledge the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to impose on him the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to allow the liquidity to be free of interest at interest rates that are moving around the zero so that banks buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to scatter some sand into the gear, as the BCE has already done with its annual increase next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just going to witness a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The fluctuations of the stock exchanges and the differences in the company bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States saw themselves forced to take up private risks and the debt of the state rose again.
It is now based on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone in relation to Germany.
Spain was so far hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down in relation to Spain's evaluation.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had tried again to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had reduced the devastating effects of the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, when they should have actually decided on a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emires to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already foreseen.
A government which conceals public debt, elections and a new government that is moving in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin Hungary to be freed from the non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some fluctuations on too high amounts, that would now be within the expectation.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in sovereign debt increase at the same speed as the European company bonuses.
However, if European differences are to be reduced and the Spanish to increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which once again come with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this, despite warnings, does not promise a long lifetime.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precautionary driving" is recommended.

The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament's Subcommittee, where the strategy on energy supply in Spain is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave some clues to the press about what he had given to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date to 2030, assuming that current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not amount to 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international associations.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal works with facilities to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the pre-condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has requested, would in no case want to say something against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one puts clearly on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Whether it is like it, Galán believes that the decisions on investments should already be taken, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework needs to be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at ground-based airports, Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been disclosed, is based on five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, 50 % of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to study energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Updeep and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction it is doing is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as construction companies and highway operators.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to drive the project forward according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and tolling management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia consisting in the last phase, mainly of European construction companies competing with each other.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second based in Italy is one of the best engineering specialists.
The Acciona team joins the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to the ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction works and privatisations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as one only gets access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy which the companies mentioned above have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish builders.
Even ACP has obtained access to this market only through its participation of 30% in high depth, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
millions of assets
Acciona places the highest importance on this geographical area for the sector, where it is already known as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry because of its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that were commissioned to build and manage the desalination plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branch building and infrastructure.
The underground toll route, which will be supported by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (Northern Transport) is intended to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels, which is the largest measure of congestion on Brisbane's streets.
The roadmap issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
Brisbane is already a major business for Hochdeep.
Australia has repeatedly awarded substantial contracts to Australia, which signed a contract with the government yesterday with 154 million.
Through its local subsidiary Leighton, ACP will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and the high depth has received 129 million for it.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has provided itself via its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the award for the construction work to extend the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine has increased its experience in tunneling.
The start of the construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertisement of Renfe
Renfe has committed advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company announced.
This contract also provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented Sch for this competition, which was awarded by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned to design and manufacture the campaigns.
More than 63 million fines for France Télécom because of the suspension of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of more than 63 million euros on the competition authority in France because of anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros of punishment since 1994 because of the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority guarding the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore become reticent again.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application-handler on the Internet to increase revenues from businesses that do not derive from the telephone connection.
Basically, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The match at the Champions League has entered Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476,4 million.
The Champions League has developed itself into a source of revenue for the football club in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in the third place of Europe, which has earned the most money by its participation and which, in addition to AC Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the running Catalan champion.
The list lists Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries which were able to spend money by the champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four bee Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated method of granting money that UEFA uses.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects the Champions League to receive a total of 1,090 million.
Of this money, UEFA 413.1 million provides for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those who struggled to participate got 3.8 million due to their bloody presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided (400,000 per team).The clubs that have come to the eighth final receive three million each; the four that have come to the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million in his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments for which 337.8 million are foreseen.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third-placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group had details of the sale of shares with which it wanted to acquire an upper limit of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1,5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at EUR 1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is connected with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives the shareholders a 15-day period in order to inform them of their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the brink of possible sales offerings and the judicial quereles of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high post in the food business.
This is a newly created post directly under the chairmanship of the group.
This is anything but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a legal battle because of the suspicion of redirection of more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that during the next few months, Sos will shift further capital.
With regard to the credit of Salazar yesterday, ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public invitation to tender submitted by the investment company Mer to Paterina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina last October 9.
The Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions under the law and therefore the content of the explanatory note submitted can be regarded as "sufficient" after the changes of the last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of EUR 550.008 shares of Federico Paterina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the company's capital, consisting of EUR 6.142.786 in shares admitted to Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592.778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the invitation to tender and whose price has been fixed by Federico Paterina in accordance with the laws of law.
New vehicle assessment programmes
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles engaged in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where an assessor has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No one accident is the same and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools it is a question of minutes
This is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers in order to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the US group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for assessment and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is increasing to the point that even more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market over the last five years than in the last fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because each of the thousands of vehicle parts has to be catagolised and its price entered.
In addition, every model creates an "intelligent" graphics image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure goes forward quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present Audatex has 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain have complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about Porsche models, but they do not have Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-going vehicle park, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialised in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) simultaneously work there with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros each year in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use them in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products offered by Audatex, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of AudaPlus products, a standard solution to assess accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it for a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 Euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSupastas is an open-ended service on the Internet for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Their statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information on the variations by brand and model.
For example, one can look at how many models of a particular car brand had to be in the workshop because of the pins or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a certain period of time.
Gt motifs are the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimates, which is also intended for experts and provides in the same way digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Group of Ones, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, loss or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT leader for advice is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their volume of business has increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business in Europe and the rest of the world is carried out, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the group Solera (Audatex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Group of Solera was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today their shares are traded at a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been part of the Standard & Poor's Reference Index on the New York Stock Exchange.
Increase in accident cars on the Internet
In last October, the Group of Solera Autoonline bought a flatfome on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively addressed to professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle number has been registered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value may, on the other hand, be re-approved even if they have been signed off after difficult official tours.
Four-step estimate of the workshop’s costs
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:Identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small vehicles and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool to assess such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can choose a door with it for example and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
