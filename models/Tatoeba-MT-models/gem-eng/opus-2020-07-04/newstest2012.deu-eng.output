No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused to abolish, in the context of an amendment to the Criminal Code, the paragraphs on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The new regulation, which could pave the way for the liberation of the imprisoned Prime Minister, rejected the Members at the second reading of the request for the reduction of the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of a allegedly negligent contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet juridical, and in December the appeal of the defendants is to be brought before the court.
Timoshenko himself referred to the ruling as political revenge of the regime and also in the West, the trial caused the suspicion of the prejudice of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The story of Libyan liberation or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As it is common in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was well-known for the right of habit of the Sharīża, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without criminality, because for theft you will briefly hack your hand off.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any dissidents of faith should be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be divided by the Qur'an from one tribe to another.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable in this country and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen not even the best and would hardly suit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even able to help out of the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse, only the fact that NATO's air raids were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a shift of shots, served the interests of Islam and our politicians emptied themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to ignore a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are worried about the displacement of the crusaders.
Do the mineral oil companies get the black gold at a spot price even without occupation?
It is hardly the case that the West can once and for all boast of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If this do not destroy them the Sharīża representatives.
Beginning of a new era of crisis
France and the rest of Europe focus on investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm broke through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France add.
Today, however, the bond market is tearing all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which in France is 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded a higher growth than originally expected (growth by 0.3% rather than predicted 0.1%), while France acknowledged a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowed down in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but stagnated from the previous quarter.
According to provisional and seasonally exceeded data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the economy in the euro area as a whole and in the EU recorded growth of 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield from their 10-year government bonds was 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government bonds increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are loud, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The selection of football has mastered the toughest task of the season!
Thanks to a well-established goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent gate of Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football has been able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will not be missed once again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half-time and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection was also successful due to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of Jiráček day in Montenegro very happy 1:0 and has thus redeemed her ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half of the time.
The Pechvogels of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, and it is also gratifying that the local football will be awarded a premium of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, quite martial football was played.
Both teams combined in length and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half of the time, the pressure of the home team remained, and the large cuts in front of the penitentiary were successfully denied by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to make it known that they are willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently long since failed to give up its efforts for nuclear weapons.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed in the afternoon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attempt to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program as far as possible, from the centre in Isfahan, the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack target would also be considered to be the nuclear enrichment plant.
The menu of a obese child: it doesn't eat breakfast and eat for evening bread sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys showed - adipous children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
Once again, we can see how important it is for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adoptive children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the eve of the Enlightenment campaign under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" Pommes for evening bread.
In families with thickeners, sport is not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students also – only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey of fewer than 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children from primary schools were interviewed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the general health insurance fund and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with obesity or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed showed, for example, five times a day, to eat breakfast-second breakfast lunch-vesper dinner-bread in mode - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the family's regular breakfast time, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families had breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone breakfasts alone.
The worst thing was the finding that is not made at all in every 10th family.
Breakfast is considered to be the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey showed, among other things, that the families of overweight children consume much more unhealthy pommes.
And almost everyone, without regard for weight, drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are sports, only less than half of their parents are doing so - that is, only 15 percent.
Lets you configure your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own diet plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinions.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many meals, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet limonades", is highlighted in the final report on this survey.
At lunchtime, that is to say the main court, pasta was won just before poultry.
The children almost did not like pulses and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunches was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire following the conclusion of the enlightening lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", in many cases there was a marked shift in preferences towards principles of a healthy diet", the results of the project indicated.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less cloves or sweet foods.
Claiming professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article about how stylists learn, I had a little tasted that this was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what was coming in the first place.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "in the square" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the examination comes, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully finished.
This time, we debated with director Alena (not a single man attends the course), how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportional figure.
And most of us are.
The one have one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and again others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually cascading broad shoulders, to extend the neck or to excite the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - with big busts, wide hips and narrow waist - nice and figure-bitten without her acting all too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or pants really don't fit, at least one should be cut to size.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles that always slips up and down, in the waist, etc.
Young characters can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, bushes, applications, embroidered or embroidered.
With this amount of information and character types, I'm glad I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the face of the assigned homework.
Each of the students was awarded a prize, for which she is supposed to design suitable outfits - daywear and evening robberies.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its character type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who may know you from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the interior I cheer, because this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who in recent times has probably increased to the hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then print them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphical side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But it's not until Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on types of figures, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a skilled stylist manages to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, such as a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear slippers and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to climb the sleeves or collars and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most of the time I found the following advice: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Then you should hurt them," Jakub said.
Finally, I realize why we need to pake all these lessons, what you can combine with, and why, even if you often get quite different things in fashion journals.
Shut up from fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared a lot more styles of clothing than he eventually photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So with all of this, you have to count on the design of the outfit.
That image and style make up among the half of success confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
You only need to look at Madonna, a not just brilliant singer, who made a world star from the image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be outstretched money (the main thing is that I bring something like I look like is second-rate).
And if any of us are to be styled, then we should expect him or her to force us with a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to Google to make sure that the boulevard press writes that the corresponding promi has again increased or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put our hearts on Sundays, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit needs "to build up".
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a widowed psychologist.
People appreciate it without offering themselves and standing up to it.
"If any manager orders us to look at her closet and to add nice pieces, then we can't clear her whole closet and say - my God, that's awful."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us concretely what so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that you tap on the waist and carry all the necessary proprieties.
Except for such clear things, such as scissors, strippers to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as nylon thread (i.e., the stylist helps to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are rubbed behind, if they are too big (snipers or other clamps are prohibited, so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing.
In order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to put our shoes down properly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe sole, keep the outside quiet.
We glued and glued...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors, so you can't hurt them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario welcomed me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we got to hear at the second-weekly continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to devote oneself to styling at a professional level is not a child's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors to the route to the early layer.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful is that even if obviously no one wanted to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
After all, he promised to move the already-old game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fit-in passages in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and continues on foot.
But how you're used to it at NFS is much different in the end effect than you expected.
Sure - it is potentially quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is reduced by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time in history, Jack's main character has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, one sits on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment to think that game would always offer the same thing again and again.
Some environments are still very nice to see, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through the autumn countryside or high up through deep snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
On occasion, untypical elements bring a little variety into each race.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert tower, which greatly restricts the sight.
In the mountains again, you have to be obsessively careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are very well built in in succession.
Only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also involved in this. They want to mess up the whole thing.
A new feature is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's more about some interactive animations where Jack flees before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (in fact only three).
In the end, this is more of an advantage, because this element has at least no chance of becoming boring - it belongs in the context of the above mentioned to the elements that make the game more varied.
The model is in the feet of the previous parts.
That is to say, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one cannot claim that it is bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations has to look around elsewhere.
But an action-laden race ride will continue to be perfectly fair in this model, even though you can find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems only occur after some time.
Unlike the model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of a game of this kind it is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object I don't know how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: In close overtaking or passing on opposite cars, in some places you only "strip" the other car lightly, in other, almost identical situation you come into the veil and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter, it's annoying all the time.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, you throw the game back to the last clue of the route.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you've exhausted them, everything starts from the beginning.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work out, but you shouldn't rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart does not help, because nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
In other countries, "civil" cars are always encountered in the same configuration at the appropriate place, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the contrahent passes before a playingly on two opposite cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that it always comes close to your nose.
Contractors have further advantages.
All over the game there are a few places where you are always taken over by the same opponent at the same place and here again without regard for the time.
At the craziest, this is to finish the game on the long bridge, which one happens in the opposite direction.
The counterman obviously has to get one out of here on the devil.
And if he's already before you, then he takes a view of course, so that you start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler model of driving, the overall game is quite entertaining and sometimes also so action-laden that you almost don't know where the head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "debt" is about it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can occur, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car over the course of the races.
You must not overlook the filling stations on the route, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you just have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of play history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual localities that you know from history.
There are not only medals here, but also points of experience for your own profile, which is shared for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to get to the higher driver level, different items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time to the online function Autolog, which compares its own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible schnitzers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you can get by car into a subway tunnel (meaning), where you can walk on the tracks in the dark (wayway).
On the tacho, figures look between 150 a 200 km/h (wayway), but there comes at once from the back of a subway and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial work, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the playmakers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and here and there even brilliant.
The more annoying thing is that at some exciting moments, the frequency of the image repeats slowly and sometimes becomes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents involving a larger number of parties, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is taste matter.
In an effort to address as wide a scale as possible more young audiences, a soundtrack a lay "of every sort" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game would not be diminished by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chesttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems somehow unfinished.
A great pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to put this error in your eyes with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Common Revolution" with singing ensembles of the Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academia offers for the third time already the quickening of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samten Revolution and this and music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and university choirs will present themselves.
The two concerts will focus on the festival, which will take place on 17 November.
"Karlsuniversität has a large share in the festival."
"Amongst the participants is also the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanities Studies and the Festival Committee is also the Rector Václav Hampl", led by Jakub Čaloun.
Absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of specialist school choirs, which takes place on November 17th at 2 p.m. on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazzist Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings in the gala rooms of the Volkshaus in Vinohrady the concert "Students of the Common Revolution" (Studenty sametu) in which also university choirs occur does not exclude choirs of the Karlsuniversity.
Festa Academia aims not only to celebrate the World Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Samten Revolution, but to present choir music at the highest level to the public and to promote the creative cooperation of young people.
The principal organizer is the association of Czech choirs in collaboration with the Johannes Kepler High School.
The patronage over the entire event took over Bohuslav Svoboda, the mayor of the capital Prague and Václav Hampl, the rector of Karlsuniversity.
The festival will take place in Prague from 16 to 20 November and in Pardubice.
The schedule includes numerous music meetings, student-hopaedic events, matines and other events in addition to festive concerts.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaaacademiaca.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between the institutions out of hand. "
I didn't expect such a tough war to burn out."
"It will take five, six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, Czech Ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply presenting her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As seriously as she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe in such a clear and understandable way the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations that she could have been in favour of some of the faculty of law of Karlsuniversity.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, criticism became loud that he was too unobtrusive - a gray official who did not have such a role to play, but I must say that everyone had lost his breath as well as he had accepted the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the agreement and better legibility of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil caps quargel.
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda, which the European Union was living and planning to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency referred to it as a great negativum, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU currently has all hands to do.
In saying the Ambassador's words, it was not only in the Presidency, but also in the ensuing crisis, which has not yet been overcome, that it was quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still needs to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which will give priority to sectors, which countries are more and which are less encouraged - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's gray accelerators, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How can I, as a citizen, know whether we really are clumsy in Brussels or round cucumbers and various great bananas, or whether we really want to be banned by someone else?
It would also have liked to have used the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are called upon to be Euroskeptics who perceive more the negative side than the positive side of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write letters of motivation and, last but not least, also the weak support of the Czech side.
Apart from the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"If you believe me, when a pole or a Hungarian comes to me and is close to a Slovak, then the Frenchman says next to me: "Hey, what are you heads put together - is that your V4 again?" and makes a pretty sour me.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future the EU expects particularly tough rules for the budgetary policy of the Member States.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much real, as a "European Federation".
"We have the countries of the euro area and the countries beyond the euro area here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation."
"First of all, it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those who do not want to do so should be left alone."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of the different speeds"", Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues affecting the EU as a whole need to be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you want to find a suitable word that characterises IBM's strategy most precisely, this would probably be the word "longevity".
IBM is the synonym for technological revolution for the general public, it is known as a modern company, although since it was founded a century has passed away.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first chief - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Even he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the future giant's life (and at the same time as the title of the company-internal magazine, which was already published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society over the course of the first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Conceived system
Watson had already spent the thirtieth years on social care for his employees - in a similar way, as did the entrepreneur Bařa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees a holiday, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out compensation system for the best new and merchants.
IBM's long-term relations with its customers are also equally sophisticated.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan to replace Palmisan at the head of IBM next year is a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken the position of the Vetriets-, Marketing- and Strategy chefin.
IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas exist enough, in the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Your unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inwards and outwards.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market only or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its family name "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has most patents and already five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include e.g. ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes, or the floppy.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of market capitalisation, IBM was the second largest technology company (even according to Apple) this year, with Microsoft being overtaken for the first time since 1996.
Looking Ahead
Not all products and innovations met today's customers' taste - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with their own OS/2 operating system, the Online Service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't be emotionally committed to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work to leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, who basically stands and falls with its Windows operating system.
Promising technologies
IBM's profits involve most of the services, software and hardware involved in one-fifth each.
In 1990 hardware with more than fifty percent was the strongest represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-making assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future-rich technologies.
IBM continues to invest in these investments after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept over the world for the first time like a storm.
Here too IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
To date, IBM seems to be beyond the present crisis.
The value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the net profit of the company has increased continuously.
IBM's corporate logo is: everything can be changed - only the values can't be changed.
That is why it can also be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: from cheese cutter to global flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Corporation.
The name IBM was only taken over in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous keycard clocks for registering the beginning and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, which was also chaired by the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him manage the company.
This leader even put IBM's founders in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas to this day on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already reveals, began to manufacture and distribute all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to boxes.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 60's, technicians and computers from IBM helped steer NASA's flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also to the moon's famous flight.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultancy part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus became fully involved in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM pays off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas that have not even been planned, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM established a branch office in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe at that time.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a top research team of world level that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful spouses:
Iveta - this donkey you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become a lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would awaken from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she would not even have come into the dream of how this goes out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to and forth after 30 days on her presses, Joseph immediately went with her.
Yes, he even publicly knew that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain bonds," said Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated herself from him and stood alone on mutual integrity.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him has so far carried Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, it doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper time, and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I'm staying perfectly normal, only we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, then he doesn't want to stop them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and therefore I assume any responsibility.
The worst female prostitutes: What about you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female perpetrators, they shake without exception a few quick out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsitting revues happen again, allowing men to wave the blood in the veins?
Shopping
Is it your husband's idea to be an addict?
Do you have to buy at least one hat a week?
Are you sure you want to go shopping and can it be a little bit more in the case of actions?
Then in your case it's probably really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire under control.
But hand to heart, what woman does it hold out to look for a well-sitting upper garment just so by strolling through a dress shop and not just trying out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times they've said to their husband - you'd better stay outside...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Aren't I too thick?"
"I'd have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does this seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you will probably also be one of the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
This does not mean that you should let go, but many men react allergicly when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger gender is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are becoming more and more unbearable.
Order and cleanliness first and foremost
It's a fight against windmills.
Wash windows, wipe tiles and dust, peel the tub - and do this at least twice a week.
Smack with her partner, because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you peel the children because the newly shaved sink is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room closet already has fingerprints, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable dirt can ultimately also damage mutual relations and, above all, family tranquillity.
Flipping
"Damn Turnhosen come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tyrade, you should not be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course that's not bad, they just want it all to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much to milk.
Klatsch and Tratsch
Some women like to clap and kick, there is flung behind the back or even slandered, or you forsook alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, which is why they like to dwell on such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of a harmless clam and a trance in stock.
Hand to heart - that's probably all women own.
But this is not to be confused with clasps of grappiest calibers, which are nothing and nobody is holy, who certainly despises everyone in their surroundings and which poses a considerable danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistance to victory
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the 5-3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina during the Monday game of the NHL with two assistants and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The nine and thirty-year-old ice hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added assistance and was called the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jagr claimed to be a journalist, he had a big evening prophesied to Giroux.
"Before the game, I'll tell him that he's a hat trick today."
I kind of felt that way."
"Hin and again, such a feeling gets over," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux already scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the Puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented it to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
Heimspieler Patrick Dwyer scored a short hand a second before the pick-up of the first third, but the second third was the flyer again.
That's exactly Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he scored his third hit, then Wayne Simmonds shot him to the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's one of the best three," said Jagr.
"I wouldn't have remembered in my life that I was playing with such an ice hockey player at the conclusion of my career, as with him."
"I'm so glad."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All these years in the NHL, my co-players set their game on me and now the spear is turning around," said Jágr.
Carolina made the game a drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who was perpetrated by a penalty shot, it came up on a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful against one in excess of two.
"Excellent was Pronger still working in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it worked," Voráček described the last hits of the game from his point of view.
This victory led Philadelphia to the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and resigned in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to her, the Canadiens also told Beck their lead an unspoiled penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not change one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the home team coach probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they played the game only with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"We only played the match with one single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done to get us done," said Jacques Martin.
"At each change a wave of attack after another and we had nothing to do with it."
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third place."
There were reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defensemen.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters were involved.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At the time, the travel agencies sold mainly only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West they were only allowed to choose.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (including Czechoslovakia) to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even at the time, the travel agencies also offered trips to the west, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" at the travel agency.
Even so, the matter had not been going on for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a trip to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary funding (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Thus, the vast majority of Czechs spent their vacation abroad, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dats - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 combined revolution followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on foot.
While a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox, one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country in the Czech Republic at all - Croatia until 1989 because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligations were abolished in the neighbouring western European countries, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough from their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers slept in the park when travelling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of travel abroad from Czechs was at that time a suitcase room packed with cans, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free-exchange Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus the average salaries increased, which resulted in a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to prepare regular flights through charter flights after 1997, which made it incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, with the exception of the United States, the Czechs had already currencyless payment transactions with all the highly developed countries in the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-total" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight was made into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, annual direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-away sunny countries; this year, twelve exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the world's highly developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per capita for a single holiday stay including the cost at the resort.
The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairman - once again threatens a Patt.
For almost five months now, Czech football has not held a chair, and the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
So far, there is no agreement as to which electoral order should be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested people want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, calling on his colleagues to find themselves a few and a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old crosswords broke out again between the two Chambers of Association, which cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague quarter of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any results, and this was not just about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is in fact entitled to vote in the full collection - only the satisfying representatives or also the officials equipped with a power of authority.
At least some agreement was reached on this one point, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which, in the opinion of a delegation on the basis of powers, was not valid.
However, disputes about the electoral system continue.
The Committee on Executive Affairs also no longer brought clarity into the matter at its meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary - there is nothing else at all on the agenda.
Even though the views regarding the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, what should be done in the 3rd round to avoid a pit situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FAČR who represents professional football in management.
According to a set-up model, in the third round of the candidate, who receives the larger percentage of support in the board for which he is running.
Moravia is said to be ready to respond to the compromise that the candidate wins, who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority in this percentage of vote counting.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which it is best not to add the electoral order but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik agrees, even if it is noted that the electoral system of all candidates is most likely Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the time will be chosen after the statutes."
"No absurd substitutes will be devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who was the first to run for the run and, in his opinions, was above all opposed to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football-EM today would certainly contribute to the calming of the minds."
"If football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says Jablonec's functionalist, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both at a professional level and at a regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is clumsy."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "adjust" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a further blockage at the general meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are said to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee is still to be brought to the location of the barrage holocaust.
Finally, the meeting at Ministerial level is crucial, which is supposed to come to us on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to have led the divided parties to an agreement within the country's largest sports association.
There is much at stake: state grants, the credibility of Czech football and also the forthcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is to show Czech sport the new direction according to the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is fighting for the president's position because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclik, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting, could have made up a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have agreed to the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I'd fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclill to go to duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclik also emphasises that in the event of his victory, he intends to perform the role of the Chairman only a year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football events.
"With some people in question, I spoke personally."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me that they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík supposedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes at general meetings.
For Paclik, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of the president.
"In his victory, the present state would be preserved and in Czech football it did not go any further."
"The support from Berbr, a clever businessman, got the football double bad," Paclik stressed.
He also suggests that Pelta's name, some time ago, fell out of which Pelta's name, in connection with telephone hearings to identify in a corruption affair, but from which Pelta came about impunity.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," saidřekl Paclik, who said his earlier statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman", but already sees something more relaxed.
If Paclik were to win in the Thursday elections, however, he could well imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclik before the Annual General Meeting in October, who ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to run the Association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclik, who in September had made it very difficult for him to stand at the head of the Arbitration Commission with Luěk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclik himself claims that he feels that the role of the president of the association has grown.
And refers to his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which detracts from the present situation", pointed out Pacid, who does not make a heel out of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax flows into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new Chairman should devote to."
"If gambling is to be taxed as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but then they also have to tell us clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not consider Paclik to be a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be "over-party".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"But I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person in a hypocritical manner in order to return after a year and a half," Paclik explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will eliminate a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman's Name, Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would make a strong decision in the event of his election that the FAČR would be given a new statute, which would in future exclude disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly dispel in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized elections in September that he would like to concentrate on the national team and funding in the event of his election.
He decided not until the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting, so he could help him defend his ideas about the direction of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, the man, who is mainly connected with the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at Ivan Hašek's time.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all assumed.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
In particular, he used the revision of the main document of the Civil Association as a means of easing the delegates.
"If I should become a chairman, I will accept it personally and will be willing to shoulder personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle which he cannot be without," says Pelta.
Furthermore, he does not try to be confined to his counterparts.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognized for his legal education and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy.
Tomáš Pakkík has not attacked him for a long time, but he did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were depressing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"For this reason, too, many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already said in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower game classes, up to the national team.
And this should be Czech football.
"I would also try to stop all affaires - from the Causa Bohemians, to the after-halls of the corruption scandal of last year."
"After that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football industry," said the six and forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleansing.
"I should first get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, by reason of the long anarchy, nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really were to be the only disputed point, how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Falling needs credibility and it only returns if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start to work hard under him
If the former Vice-Chairman Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as the new chairman of the Czech Republic’s football association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly mean that many people in the Association would not be in a mood.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemian case, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that former President Ivan Hašek has started.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, via the national selection, professional football, up to performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything by myself," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to share the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses in every segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted because instead of criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered not to compete at all.
"From me it is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are standing behind me who don't throw me indifferently between my legs and question every step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people told me, however, that I shouldn't give up because otherwise it would be done by others."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
He is allegedly also motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a great deal of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"There have been processes that have been started, probably only in a few years, and I would only regret to see that they stop someone," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mostly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the elect."
I guess I can be accused of something, but not that I'm partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is doing well and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a president of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moravians."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part whose winners then ascended to the first league."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Pakkík has joined the battle for the chairman’s role, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of his being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to its deputy chairman and now realizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl pointed out, who also regards the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unprofitable contracts, the agreement on television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the Association does not get into a single line.
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from before to help Czech football to gain new confidence," he believes the second rival - Paclid for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek initiated and also the staffing of the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He certainly would not want to turn things to his favor," Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe’s Most Beautiful Pools
Jump to Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbucken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue miracle - and after a city tour or hike rest the tired legs in splash baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past one and a half years, one in her luggage could not be missing: her swim suit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artificially designed domes, swam against marble pouts waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and marveled at acribically restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she took it quickly into her notebook - along with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now introduce her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Regrettably, swimming fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while jogger can breathe in the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to a cheerful bird-whip in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder who lives in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful baths."
Water Surface Doubled Architecture
Sprayers in the jumping pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, says Meder.
And if the builders have given themselves trouble, swimming pools can be a real eyepiece: "The place of a floor is a water surface in baths."
"She is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the whole building on the other."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
On 190 pages, the small-format picture band "Badefreuden" conveys valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all makes it a pleasure to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ancient Karsthöhle (dwelling in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termålfördö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the drift on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary pool design awaits bath guests in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open up it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal line up into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder climb the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of heating oil, which you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and its taste sticks one to the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a special wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing area in the Czech bath Luhatshowitz, she found a fenced terrain.
The bathroom, designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder threw a look through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has counteracted the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction this bathroom has already been built; one can discover not only neo-romanic elements that came from times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the pool-Kennerin Iris Meder - and not only because it originally came from the Black Forest.
"It's already an achievement to merge different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the thermal swimming pool is obviously only a side-by-side.
Agro-speculation
Deutsche Bank makes raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business on agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE-Information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO then wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global stock exchanges raise prices - and therefore the banks bear a co-indebted debt to the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is specifically directed against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
In the original case, raw materials laws were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
But most experts now agree that the sugars have decoupled from supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "worthy to risk the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the audit will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - as well as recommendations on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the top of the bank wants to announce the consequences it has.
In the end, a reduction in the raw material business, or even the complete turnoff, could occur.
Ackermann barks at his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Bets on rising food prices show particularly drastic how ruthless banks today harm the general good."
Ackermann is now a top bank lobbyist in particular.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture from office a few months before his departure.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the Head of the Executive Board will not switch to the Supervisory Board.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to shave - it would have to do with his successor.
Each second would terminate raw materials facilities
Foodwatch tries to keep pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa interviewed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Thus, 11 percent believe that Deutsche Bank is legitimate in offering food priced facilities.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each second, according to the survey, would terminate all facilities where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would dissuade acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent reported thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won awards in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and combed.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is engulfed by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the Brüssler World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzers Pavilion then got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made it known to the architect that he also built at the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavilion.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus small-scale side construction in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
The pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition building had been set up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof in 1962 and a museum of the 20th century was opened in it - the "20 house" was called.
But the building was not suitable spatially and technically as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, now called "21 House" and is used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a lucky case in every respect.
In 2007 Agnes Husslein-Arco became new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, professor of art history with considerable careers, including in the youth as an ice art runner, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pursued the transformation with politicians and monument protectors, obtained public funds and private sponsorship funds and established the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same foundation, a café and a bookstore should exist, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small estate
For the implementation, Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only because he transformed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was an "unpretentiously important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in his relocation to Vienna and its re-use of generosity and ease.
In the current conversion, there were far bigger problems: the building was "an energy barrier", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Refrigerated bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two underfloors took place for the new use, a lowered light pit between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection colour.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the Monumental Authority and with a small budget.
"Frequently, a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor on the lower floor.
Despite all constraints, problems and alterations, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has entered a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden is the newly planned "Main Railway Station Quarter", with office and residential buildings.
And another accident of luck may still occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca from Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighboring location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans Winter Crisis Package in Million Heights
The railway has a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
According to the German Railway, in the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, more than 70 million euros are issued by a newspaper report this year.
The "image" newspaper reported in advance, calling on a group’s internal crisis plan, with investments of a total of around 300 million euros by 2015.
This should ensure better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railway stations and ascents to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free train paths from snow and ice within four to five hours, up to the beginning of the operation and 90 percent of the necessary shifts.
Two months ago, after a summit meeting with government and industry, Bahn-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For years, many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Railway Federal Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE had an axle break in the Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars in the US
After the tumult about chief Josef Ackermann comes new monster from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home for Deutsche Bank were not enough, the industry giants are now taking up their past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison of 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes due to the pleite of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks to have led cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have lowered the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and hit the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German-bank speaker in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA president, Debbie Matz, welcomed the presence of the two ATMs.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. cooperative banks and is in charge of ploughing in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA attempts to replace the billionaire damage caused.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also prepped other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
The mortgage documents in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, it became a liability for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers snapped.
Even though events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have attempted countless lawsuits to obtain repayment or to avoid failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest complaint wave.
It proposes 18 major international banks to have over-distributed to two US government real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of about 200 billion dollars.
The Deutsche Bank must also file a complaint with FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires Frankfurters to face "substantial losses" without, however, giving a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unconditional and declared that it wanted to resist.
Warren Buffett goes up with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always declared that he is not investing in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is only poorly forecasted.
Now, however, he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services, above all, and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a battle of knights in the financial world.
The IT-Urgestein IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett now revealed in the US Economy Station CNBC that he had purchased IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew something about the commitment.
He praised the management, which had made good profits even in the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," said Buffett on the strategy.
IBM has for some time been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had previously avoided technology firms.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, for example, Buffett went to a freight train, to a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns some 80 own subsidiaries in a number of large companies such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Municher Reck.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with wise investments to one of the world's most valuable companies.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inconspicuous sense of earning money has given him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
According to the known Buffett investment, the IBM stock increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now alive again.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkish people have thus returned a long-believed ghost: Since the fire strikes in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is hostility against foreigners in Germany was still never in question.
However, the exposed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet apparent.
"Does the bloody ideology live up again?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the radical right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with a prayer of warning to the victims of racist violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate on weekends.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish acquisition agreement.
In cheerful colours the co-scene had been staged - as a story of success.
The report of some Turkish media is like a slap: "Germany's fifty-fifth gift" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which gives the background to the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It starts to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that taxes had been paid and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German Turkish Internet forums, extremely critical discussions are held about the police's actions and their later success.
The authors wonder why the German authorities have not been much more involved in looking for suspects in far-right extremist circles.
Some of them show themselves at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to be slammed here, then the migrants will be left nothing but self-defense and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network, inner peace in Germany is very much dependent," writes "Selen".
What it means if inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of Solingen's fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turkish living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right violence.
However, the attacks heightened the vi-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, German politics' failure was particularly criticised after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Presidents, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - at that time Kinkel counted in his speech how many charges the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks has been in the current rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of extensive education and reassessment of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Skandalbank of the Zürisee
Europe's most adventurous bank is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been scrapping from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think of it that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, he was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, Switzerland praised their beauty and the UBS for their new solidity and made kind remarks about future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villier and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A retailer from the UBS in London had bypassed all the bank's security systems and destroyed around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS Chief Executive Officer Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been regarded as being attacked - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber is allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the Board of Directors already in May - not until 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, he is an economic professor and banker, and he would certainly have had a period of integration.
With one blow, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of the largest scandal bank in Europe.
For the UBS is, on the one hand, huge - until recently, it was the world's largest asset manager - and, on the other hand, has been slipping from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once so proud Swiss bank saves.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of Swiss asset managers who were silent and solid, but also outraged, had combined them with ambitious goals: they also wanted to become a big number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was pushed into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich told Hans Geiger: "At the time, I always presented the UBS as a pattern of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, how could I be so wrong?"
He was terribly wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The bank’s investment division had been tying up with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to train this, UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of sage and write down 13 billion francs.
For this purpose, she actually found investors, but which, over which some of them had until recently been circling their nose: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so silent that one did not even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second best paid Board of Directors of Switzerland in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced-change bond over which it could become the bank's co-owner.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see Graph).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," said bank researcher Geiger.
The second came to the first disaster.
A few months later, UBS surrendered to America in the tax dispute and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been behind taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalty payments.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer fees.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through mispromotions and in asset management through aid for tax evasion.
And just when it got a little quieter again, just when one thought, now the UBS will get it back, that's the bad merchant story: a single dealer is gonna pluck up EUR 1.7 billion before the bank realizes that something's going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: With risk management in investment banking it obviously still does not work.
"With the case of Adoboli, one has to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the bank institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the UBS is that she is not in control of risk control."
It had been precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago taken action to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, security for money - could the world collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered at Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace and to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered by a heavy turn door.
Inside the walls are marbled, in front there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but somehow displaced - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, finally, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has grown far too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing left to say.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, brought its first high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of its nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were granted by politicians to save the large bank before bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks joined a huge group.
A bank was created that was already too big during the merger for small Switzerland - and was growing ever further.
In doing so, the two different predecessor banks of the UBS complemented themselves: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came to a great deal of money, with which they could rotate a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at the time.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banker Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, humble, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked from banking to top."
But Ospel relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Of course: Overconfidence came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings on which CEO Wuffli repeatedly encountered the same Parole edition: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That's why the UBS wanted to go to the top.
A few steps you have already succeeded.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock market, she played at the top.
However, corporate consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank invested itself and a hedge fund established before it in American subprime facilities.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and passed securities on American mortgage loans, but also retained risks.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than planned.
Posts at the UBS have become the veil seat and remain fragile until today.
Whoever is leading the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has handed down all the related business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: to end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Schweizer was only meant to be a transitional solution when the bank suddenly separated from predecessors Grubel.
In the meantime he has asserted: He is to conduct the business of the UBS permanently, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to go back to the investment bank in the mid-nineties.
3500 places he strikes.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is sure to be asking himself now.
To date, he only says that he will start looking for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe strained US stock exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has encouraged US investors to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
Drowned industrial production on the continent suffocated the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the germ.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell over the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still half full last week, not half empty - but now the problems hit the foreground again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales schedules.
The Dow Jones standard index of values recorded for the trade close with a minus by 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer commuted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The comprehensive S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, one minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is geared towards the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office reported.
The US investors were sceptical about this: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape from a recession as quickly as possible, and there will be further signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do anything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
It is therefore too early in his view to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and joined the US technology industry.
His investment of over ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially had it recorded almost one percent higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to his own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shares were significantly higher at 2.6 percent than the market.
The house silvers almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and pays 6.6 billion dollars for it.
With the net gain from the business, the institution aims primarily to cushion its capital ratio and thus to comply with stricter regulatory requirements.
Boeing's aircraft builder increased and thus reduced the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order of its history.
On Sunday, Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 and counted the value of the order to 18 billion dollars.
Includes options for 20 more machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
At the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed to the owner.
719 values increased, 2281 declined, and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares in the plus, minus 1913, and 82 closed unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread out in cities
In many places seedlings are considered "problem birds": But the highly intelligent animals can no longer be sold out of the cities, experts claim.
One likes them, the other likes them to get rid of them quickly: crows have been a townscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents are heaping complaints about the filth and noise of animals.
So far, a means against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crop symposium in the East Frisian blank.
There, experts from all over the federal territory made contact with possible outings.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
In doing so, nature conservationists also brought the problems in cities back to the land-flight of the specially protected seeds: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly undermines the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the fall of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are available, among other things, in western Soest, in the northwest, among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in empties.
In 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crows in the county had provided for negative strike lines.
Critics had called catching the animals in bird traps and beating with clubs particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, burying, brings nothing," observed city and landscape planner Werner Klövern from Leer.
Nests spray away with water or fall trees, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dissipate, large colonies split up and spread in other places."
Banishment can only be considered as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding area, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said.
It could be thought to be a combination of combing the animals from sensitive living areas and shelters to relocate them in other places.
"Infotables instead of chainsaws" on the other hand, psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens threw a completely different approach to the animals: "We can finally bear a pimple in the face with the best self-confidence."
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen-Tehrpfad on which he informed us about the life of the highly intelligent seeding cranes.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Even to the criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication there, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seedlings not only use tools to get to a tasty bite, but even create their tools themselves.
Conduct researchers from Cambridge University recently tested four seedlings, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring in a scaffold with stones in order to get to a moth larvae.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone must have in order to have the platform collapsed.
In a second attempt, the picky crows had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small egg with a moth larvae.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid down wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then angled the wig at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seeding cranes actually succeeded this at once.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 EM
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup persisted.
The favourites are Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last European Championship 2012 tickets in the Playoffs in Poland and Ukraine.
Following the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after the 0:0 out of the game.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at outside Montenegro, after the playoff (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
No longer let Croatia burn in at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored further hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a changed trading meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
Portugal got off to scale in the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick of about 30 meters to the early lead in the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide shot qualities and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The Ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a ball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the heart of the field.
After an attack against Hero Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
Petr Jiracek ended the last doubt for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth time in a row for the European Championship in 1976.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to survive a terrible second in the early stages.
With a reflex at the last moment, end-mann Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest potential if the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation from the penalty room border just past the gate of Cech.
After the break the transverse had to save for the already beaten world class gate of the Czechs, again the striker of the FC Seoul had dropped off (50.).
The gate was finally clear.
Turkey, however, missed the Zagreb Football Wonder.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not go beyond 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink has to clear up his seat on the Bank of the World Cup Third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in an EM Endrunde.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks would almost have caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the paws in the seventh minute with a distance shot, but the attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the impactor in the gate.
But after a terrible second, Croatia took over more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga-Legionaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM part since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the playoffs, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) looks like the guests.
Ireland pushed from the start to the pace, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian hintermann prevent the possible lead hit.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was ready.
After an unsuccessful defense by closing man Pavel Londak, Ward was at the station and pushed the ball to the 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015 some two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit employees accordingly," announced Co-Chairman Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 Dax Group strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, Walldorfers had redeemed some 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, who employs 55,000 employees worldwide, is running as rarely as usual.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our aim is to promote sustainable growth in China, based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Compassionate and generous Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters who go to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmarks.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic narrative very well. And these main characters will act as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you, like Englund's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe inadvertently as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, rushing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in a church, some come in, while others die.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating postwar war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" travels with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance.
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," says Englund, "have been furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mostly taken from memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or catchy, but they are extremely alive in Englunds, the accumulation of small moments in detail.
Many of them act in need and help themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper compounds, wooden buttons."
He tells more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in hazel fat (and last served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were infested with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to ferocity and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that, that is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the chair, with the evening leaf or bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so than mean such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarity behind his own strengthened and lamented shirt chest."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and will not take notice of it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations deal with the old Europe that is falling apart and with new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," says Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in proportion, who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
Humans behave in an unexpected way and there are just as frivolous behaviour as heroism.
Englund talks about the soldiers who were actively trying to infect a prostitute with a sexual disease in order to escape the front duty.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonocokken-Eiter, for soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were truly desperate, tear him into the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way in which the war "extremely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more fake than Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "Nothing New in the West" than extensive historical books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book of books.
I'm not giving it back anymore.
But it's like he caught us with his book this side with the main characters in front of the nose and lit us with a matchwood.
After an early misstep a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at that time there are hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of past weeks such as the use of pepper spray against Protestants, which violates the rules of the district council and gave housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos education - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move to the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which spoke for a declaration as "exercise".
"The few police involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about the Zuccotti Park," said one who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officers of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then they turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday operation, including deployment orders from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high-criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go in and out in the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people in the park stops," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers were ready before the exit at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lights and the previous recorded news that came out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply raked their things together and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 p.m. no tents would be touched to give the Protestants time to pack up their possessions.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area in order to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials' association was very harsh.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken pictures.
When the police were moving westwards through the great confusion over personal things of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial grasses and bags with clothes, her staff followed up the cleaning of the city, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Images of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter are linked to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil servants were called to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to the police, the room was closed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, due to "indecent behaviour and resistance to arrest".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, was the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of department of the detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not conduct the surgery", as Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street, waited for them to access.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block southward, barricades were built.
It could be observed how these locations from the police extended the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
In one place it was observed that several officials, many of them with shields, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern district.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o'clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police car and other demonstrators left the air from the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a Protestant came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file a complaint against the city for dismissals
The trade union, which represents hundreds of schoolchildren who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies are not necessary and discriminatory because of their undue influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity still open to the trade union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city's worst paid employees and who had lost their jobs on 7 October in a chess train described the union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund held by the working groups with which the budget gap should be closed last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget, that it had been adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that staff would be released from school aid.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference that formally announces the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as defendants and eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson of the city’s Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not facing the lawsuit and therefore their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit presented by the New York Times, the trade union has concentrated on the number of redundancies in schools in the poor districts of the city in order to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers since they were chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants were lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
In finding the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of vilified parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculation for extra funding for each school registration.
The trade union also complains that the leaders of the high schools were led astray by the language in a memo which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translate) in the US usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred", the draft of the action states.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington already agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee on International Relations adopted a resolution under the auspices of President John Kerry (Massachussetts) and Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "must".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya, who have begun the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libya debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House disputed the election of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution approving the limited use of military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this law was passed in the Senate. Moreover, the board passed a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was forced enough to criticize Obama's approach in the course of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now perhaps the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee for International Relations "gratulates Libya's people for their tremendous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "glorifies the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners, who support military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they divide the legislators, as the June law has done?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the top republican of the Committee.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional legislature of Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area to be put to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
So far, other legislators have unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have often tried enough.
A good amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments tabled by this Congress and covering a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both Congress and Senate - others are slightly different.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially those who want to polish up their careers - the possibility of boasting that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to abolish the President's limitation to two terms of office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids a marriage under the same sex is also a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states reject them.
As keenly as Members propose changes, they are moving as quickly as they have in recent years.
In the 11th Congress, legislators presented 77 such changes. in 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment, which is to add - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Affected, but not defeated", said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man from a distance shot at her during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday evening. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she ranked for words and needed help walking.
The mission showed the heavy slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided its skull, pierced the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to Congress to give her voice triumphantly to the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, when six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "heavi".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the 8th January attack.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with bare shaved head and a long scarf over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nod with his head.
Tuck with your lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants your breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see how Congress MPs sing together with the therapists on Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and on Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy every day, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12 he had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the six people who had been killed during the attack for the first time.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a Missouri prison and is forced to undergo medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated"? said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll come back more than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed by Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The sharp contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most remote, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are heaped with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting in this way, as if you were hurting the people in uniform.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support that person is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to be ungrateful or in dispute with the public who serve them.
They have also recognized that the anger of returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War has been far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of reverence as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "wrong, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return took over an elevated state post in Washington.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was perfectly usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who ordered U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Forces recognize the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military puts itself under growing pressure to get a hard grip on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are being charged with non-intervention in the event of a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are available for the next hearing.
Survived Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier’s colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12-pack beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman wiped aside her concerns.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claiming she was.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, deciding whether a lawsuit against former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be brought before the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld did not take action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., filed the complaint initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men who all claim that they were raped by soldiers or abused sexually, and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an appropriate case-law according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has been contacting nearly 400 survivors since February, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs, so to speak, putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defense, led by state attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the action.
The files of the court, which are available in Newsweek, are based in detail on the strategy of defense, primarily on the fact that the military cannot be accused of injuries by current or former soldiers to which they have been subjected in the armed forces.
Under a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the defendant's military service," says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers' teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds of them, died in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three other charges besides them are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the alleged promotion of an anti-fraud atmosphere.
The non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America makes a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", which received rape victims in order to release them from service - a common procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veteran Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans) in which she proposed her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offer a number of points of reference.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
But most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole series of police, doctors and officers.
She had a rape kit and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before she was assaulted.
Six persons claimed to be character witnesses in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was finally exonerated.
"I still remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would be used. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came back out, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to seek out a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was discharged unjustly, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit, which Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is progressing is mere speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should go forward."
What is between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first challenged.
I'm still a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability brings.
He adds: "The chances stand against them... but it's important to them that they try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will begin with hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms are made," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok race in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent much time up to his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log on to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the UK idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers just have to use the advertising tool of the site to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of extreme right-wing groups all over Europe and then showed them with additions, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude toward violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a pretty new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and annoyed by immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the last five years.
For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this site people who usually cannot be reached by using their clipboard on the street.
"When you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their Facebook noise tend significantly more to problem drinking than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-ranking students, such as housing consultants, monitor the site and help a student when it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't realized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also constantly taps the data of its own population.
The page's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Happiness Index (which mainly uses information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data discovery pit accessible to others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page they are watching, whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to carry out its own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks, despite his years as a technology researcher, that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social affairs - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Calt and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears in public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Knight of the Temple of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate from organizations that support Hassideologies, and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I accept the laws, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a speech written in advance, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered Breivik police to remain in custody for another 12 weeks, not having access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and Riegel.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything goes out of the way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked into journalists and survivors when he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not a mental illness and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may agree that the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said one victim's family.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs that was shown in a theater this week
After Steve Job's death on October 5th, some compared him to Henry Ford and raised the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which this week before special screenings were dusted on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and himself appointed hippie, but he was also an acrobibian organizer who was enthusiastic about diagrams - a man who believed that many managing directors suffer from "a disease of thought", "that makes a really great idea 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachdidioten" about the break-up of the personal computer. And he spent longer than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At the time, when jobs had been forced out of Apple for 10 years, he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in experts, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing during the delivery.
It was only after Job's death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which enters the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor extensive interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly keen in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of remorse, where jobs are clearly weighing their thoughts and trying to be accurate.
There are also moments when Job's perfectionism comes to light when it appears impatiently reacts to Cringely's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow mysteriously farsighted when jobs evaluate what other companies make of their opinion right or wrong and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous merits of career jobs’. But seeing jobs here as the inquisitive dreamer, who is on the leap to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after carrying out all this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline the accounting process with Apple.
Astounded how costs were recorded - mostly with "standard costs", which were counted on mere assumption and then adjusted with "distinction" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the least.
How the Pope became special:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-power, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, making a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another, while dragging as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things about the globe for half a dozen times, and when you poured into the phone, a minute later it came out on the phone next door," says Job.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs are further told about a glorious trick Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they could do Henry Kissinger as well.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs received a part-time job for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my views on what a company was and how well it dealt with its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP staff who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brownish tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up to HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to Improve Innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he installed some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later on in Apple he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember pervasive arguments... They shouted that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
Over large companies leaving behind:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs anticipated the paths that so many industrial giants had taken with their visions in Stolpern and lost control of their shares.
"Did we say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better cop or printer, na and?"
They own the monopoly of shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people], who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopolistic position, is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, Microsoft could have been in the 1990s...
They won the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to know 5000 things, these concepts, and they all come together...
In the end, it goes out to the taste, it goes on to try to break up with the best stuff that humans have created and then try to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who are by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws, accepting as court case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case is represented before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the healthcare system, which had been decided by Congress last year, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour discussion is expected in March, which is likely to lead to the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be tapped will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the Government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsors the dinner venue, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical engineer Pfizer Inc., who is extremely financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court had consulted about the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, Republican Group leader in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting events of federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are free from the code of conduct that regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they did, they would probably fall under the principle of 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in the benefit events of law closer to and other organizations, with the judge not being a spokesman, guest of honour or according to the program being a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was extended to two of the firms related to the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this, in order to alert moral and government activists.
"This astonishing breach with morality and the contrast to the Code punishes the lawsuits of some judge lies, the court holds the same rules as apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a Beneficiary event with lawyers with floating procedures at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would easily mix justice with groups who are led by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kaken was General State Attorney under the Obama administration when the first legal appeals came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of bias, because she was too much involved in the defense of the law to be unintentional.
Kagan does not make any plans to do this.
Boeing takes record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 dual aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It's really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft is overall at a record amount of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced his biggest order on the weekend of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 twin Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also announced Boeing it on the 2011 Dubai aviation show, an option for buying 20 more aircraft that will raise the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8 ordered the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the consumption of petrol and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stockbroker of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so damaging because the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural hedge," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps to keep SAS's Airbus competitors in check, which attacks the predominance with the A350.
Boeings victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was delayed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported opponent Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for the governorship in the Western state from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in polls ... they occupied electoral booths, built roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only barely beaten Claderon, who had been conducting the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Accion Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current Governor, came to place three, a heavy defeat for the split and unlucky left leadership for the presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels that specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's homeland and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how reluctance the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race for the presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory will give us a brave look next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, ADB's administrative director based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations of the world must do "everything in your power" in order to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who are "unpassionately" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all on the same boat."
"Everyone is therefore helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has suffered a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have increased dramatically and the Prime Ministers, both Italy and Greece, have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and lead to calls for the leading emerging economies to get together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU Rescue Fund Bonds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro zone, as its own economy is now suffering from the sinking exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro zone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else we'll find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at US Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, more than 800 million of which live on or less than a day.
"Sometimes they will find out that the Greeks with 50 retire and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly guided, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The forecasts of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/throat now "the risk of declassification" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would need to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant outflow of capital from their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unremarkably weaken national security, thus triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian flow belts.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if the Congress cannot finish the expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a Congress failure in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a stoppage of numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such an unconventional way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to dissociate ourselves involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainty in order to reach the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our preparedness for alarm."
The cuts were finally hit by the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the war-time quotas in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the confiscation, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to wartime traders and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of confiscation of the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehement to this Draconic act," said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and there is certainly no one to push us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthen demands to remove the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly outraged the possible cuts, although he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a gloomy picture that might arise - a military with a bowl but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an Air Force Squad without adequately trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to absorb it with potential opponents."
"She really makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details on how reductions created "significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations on our global deployment and inability to absorb, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects in the strike could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
How to Defuse a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how anxious and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is concerned with becoming master of the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both of whom are guilty of lying to each other.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the misdemeanor, since reportedly one has withheld reports that a retired football coach has sexually abused a boy.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he ran around denials that were very quickly refuted by insurmountable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violation of campaign financing associated with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, nobody who has experienced it forgets the media circus, the President Bill Clinton, when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about mud in school and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers gave their students the answers to the exams so that they could do well in their performance checks themselves.
Mentoren, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and scams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognize or "cover up lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as Sharaden, in which it is the goal to call "Get!", depressing a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected at prestigious universities over the past six decades, which carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the ancient myths were evaded by the lie.
Lies look you in the eye.
They do not always stutter, stutter, reddish, and zapple.
But it must not be concluded from this that these liars are hard to expose and decompose.
A trained liar can penetrate the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of detachment. And it is clear that depressing a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in the right way in our complex world, especially if the hiring or questioning of people or negotiations or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appreciating other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions, and they sense intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extroverted people more often lie than introverted people, that men more often "self-oriented" lies optically than women whose lies "orient themselves more to others" - they usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person is disarmed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughter, the voice quality of your test person.
You should know better when someone normally tripping with his foot constantly, so that they don't accuse him of being wrong when he tripped with his foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells shrilling, not as evidence of withdrawal.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "stress after the interview", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Those in question often falsely signal that an interview is over only to keep an eye out after this relaxation after the interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's assailant is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive persons can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptible than factual, which often makes the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic tool for depressing lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a detachment is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can become less likely to be victimized by scammers, both in private and professional life.
A controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions were annoyed and at the same time reassured environmentalists, it is the pipeline-building company that seeks to plan the project again so that one can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that you will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after a announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which one would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until the new possible course was reviewed which avoids the area of the sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh off the laws to force a departure from the region of the sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused that she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco-diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a stroke that would have scared her little daughter to surrender in fear.
The tyrade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year, when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to chimp - she used the F-Word and the A-Word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tap water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would be hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls asking for an opinion.
The lawsuit is based on a non-closer amount of compensation, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he will not charge any fees and plan the family to donate the money they receive to help with child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is laid against a nursery gardener who carries an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change slowed the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloas’ economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is to the government. However, because of the climatic hardships, growth cannot be the reason, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses of millions in agriculture, but also narrow limits to the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter. This mainly stems from the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which slowed down on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Sustainable Agricultural Development Council) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of land used for agriculture were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity by November has caused unemployment to rise continuously in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March 55,053 Sinaloas had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter the unemployment rate rose to 5,28 percent and from July to September to 6,19 percent, resulting in 74,000 people in Sinaloa. That is 18,969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year dates back to several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that public institutions' policies indirectly explain the growing unemployment rate.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cutbacks of legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because it is not easy for those who illegally collect dollars to let them work for themselves, to invest them or to use something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment rate is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased, on the one hand, due to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here looking for work that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of those employed in the country without paying in the social security funds.
The low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, come to unemployment and undeclared work according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regulatory Authority for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; this is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
ADI decline
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, in 2011, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) over the last ten years is recorded. According to the State Economic Authority, the ADI was 630,597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143,312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Economico del Gobierno (Economic Development Authority) has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from tertiary companies.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, the State Government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in July at the National Congress, but the Landeskongress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but by November no positive impact of the debt on any of the sectors in the country could be identified.
Reactions
The first year of Mario López Valdé's reign was manifest to representatives of entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise views of different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very thirsty this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all and in particular the progress made by the already well-involved government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently moving to produce an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
redefine appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Commercial Federation of Mexico) in Sinaloa, declared that the state should be given more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would improve the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
For five years in prison and 100 daily sentences, a population of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic prosecutors announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana for trade.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by the Mexican military in the control of Cipriano Valdez Street compared to security station No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white van where he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the offender is still in the execution centre.
Debts for construction work
Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 social buildings for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the urban authority for social development explained that although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now at risk, as the government has not paid the funds available to it that exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in construction would be expected.
"12 million have to be added, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they have already had to pay us part of it in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its reign the church had to borrow 7 million, which corresponds to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"We had already gone this way in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Even if the State authorities were obliged to disbursement these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, was asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million they have to contribute, and even though the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The transformation of analogues to digital signals has been among the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree and, by virtue of which the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cafetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Decree-Law would contradict hierarchical principles and the law retention.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives filed constitutional complaints against the Decree of the Law. Following the adoption of the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of the Law and ceased all activities for the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government must not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if you do, the independence of the regulatory body would be impaired." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because they are the leaders of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place throughout the world in recent years, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, was a postponement of the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "which include economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "needed the whole system to act in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries worldwide had already implemented the digital switchover via the government, although they had highly specialised facilities.
It was not possible to conclude that the government would, with the publication of the contested decree of the law, enter into the powers of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative body would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultsados Electrices Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the presidential elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the president of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, pointed out that just last November, the Electoral Committee adopted a number of rules on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the federal states in electoral matters.
It should be borne in mind that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law or his electoral law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state adjudicating officer within the time limits provided for by the Congress with the argument or to object.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislative body and judged the candidate's vote on constitutional reforms as "unlawful and illegal", since he did not have the right to "decide on it or impose a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of the single counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral authority could now have partly or completely counted the ballot.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part The results in the protocols are not consistent; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not available or are not held by the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the person on second place who is equal to or less than one percent, the total number of filled-out ballots may be calculated, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairperson, who is the second of the said candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, upon completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an express request is made by a representative of the party whose second candidate has become. In this case, the electoral packages that were subject to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is close to 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés settled on this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila together with the others who were killed in the accident in an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The closest persons were present at the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon noon, the ash of the colonel landed at the mourning hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This show was initiated by his former associates from the technical school and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, pilot's sister.
From their point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he lived in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of Zapopán Air Force, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always sought to become his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had gone to Zapopán to graduate his family member. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what was best for him: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
The chief lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honoured by Governor Jorge Torres López, who honored the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the head of the school and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and found himself outstanding both in his studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he fled crashed, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority.
At 6:05 p.m., the inmate remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, at the front of the barracks. His family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers, were already expecting him there.
The abandoned body was found on a property on the Cadreyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials introduced eleven people to the media who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Caderyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passersby saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, stood all the way up.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons inside about three meters further, which they immediately communicated to the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one dressed with a white top.
Just one meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were on the abdomen.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been murdered in another place since no cartridges were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse you can read inscriptions that write an organized gang of criminals to another, as well as several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaria de la Defense Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal act that was mainly active in the village of Caderya, who are associated with kidnappings, murders, Halconeo (manhunts) and secret funerals.
After the information was made public, eight persons were first arrested in the settlement of Los Alveros on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and one mobile phone were secured, and the prisoners confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12th at 06.00 hrs, on their watch round in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta, a car with no number plates with two inmates found a car.
At the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret restitutions in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday Formation of the new Italian government
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this to the new government, which has led the crisis that Italy has at the brink of economic collapse, which is to offer its forehead.
The prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this to the new government, which has led the crisis that Italy has at the brink of economic collapse, which is to offer its forehead.
A Communication from the Presidency Palace announced that on Sunday Monti would meet with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday, to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a majority cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government formation.
"I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set off", he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, that is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has brought the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package that was requested by Europolitans in order to regain the established confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti's speed increased as a result of the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were taxed at 7% interest for 10 years, corresponding to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Confindustria Association of Italian Industries, announced the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government with all our strength."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to come out of this emergency.
The chances of success of Montis were considerably increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential because so far many of its members have opposed a majority government consisting of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resisting its efforts or delaying reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks, with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, also exerts pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
The sitting was closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who started an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief break-up towards the end of last week, when Berlusconi announced that it would resign, uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached critical limits for the costs of the Italian government bonds.
A rescue of Italy with a debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, an indication of their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure on financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and the differences between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Ten out of 22 players from Spain have over 50 international games on the hunch.
From Costa Ricas has only one of the 22 conscripted 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendly game that takes place today at 15.05 p.m. in the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-piece team only has Michael Umana as the only player with more than 50 international games.
This number was reached on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups like the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish Fury come with complicated break-out games at the Eurocup and the World Football Championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings in the context of the Concaf, which is on the FIFA rankings at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on last Saturday against England (downtown 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will be playing against the three-legged team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona football club player, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition last week from UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubicarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and near Michael Umana, the left-wing side tower Junior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet had their debut.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 matches, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintet entered Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give next Sunday at the national stadium one of their best concerts.
For more than 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will be performing at the National Stadium from 7.30 pm together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means to your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time that we are playing in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll probably stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you this because the fans of the band have turned out completely, and they're experiencing the most intense days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have needed so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've had in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on some giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and we love the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been surfing Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the great places to surf. In this way, we have heard about people who love surfing.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Each one likes another song, so the decision we're going to play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven't played anymore, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us to mind the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise they might get forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music even now together.
We like and are excited about producing music.
We are lucky to be able to drive to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundant unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still looking forward to being friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this rising Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have played together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being happy, still alive, and also taking care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of the music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what she has created, without being excited about being a famous rock star. That has never interest us.
What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good at Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I remember what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose to open it?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and this band liked us best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is sure to be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing in his heart.
Who were you influenced by as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first ones that impress me include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I liked.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion show?
I don't think we all feel very attached to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I think about the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find it great because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit easy. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are rated as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
Both came to me the tears when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embodies this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his home doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who has been detained for 25 years for violations of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congress member and his personal doctor, told TV that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that he felt that Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, and yet he did not wish to do so because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated on tongue cancer four times and he lost 18 kilograms of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs were listed by the doctor.
Fujimori has been located in Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official decree, led by the Uuguay president José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between both countries and discuss political issues in the region
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uuguay president, this will be the culmination of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collection of Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for exchanging information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is looking for Calderón's support for the incident with France, when French Governor Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries which still appear as tax havens from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted an inquiry with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double settlement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the implementation of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay which has contributed to a growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes this month to the shop counters of all the world has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, with which without any special glasses can be played three-dimensionally.
"Mario is the figure that has to tell you how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the person responsible for the press specialising in Nintendo in Spain in presenting the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because until now, success items such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarene of time 3D" have been adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman stressed that although it was three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land was a "supplicable" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "light" to capture the less clever users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" on the different levels of play that are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects", three-dimensional must always be played.
This trip Super Marios into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists to the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The cordless installer must overcome dangerously plucked platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the delivery of portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible in the United States for conspiracy to spend $70 million on money laundering.
So the trial ends about the US's request for delivery to Portillo, so that it can be brought to court there.
In a press conference, Mr. Colom, confirmed his decision on the independence of judicial authority and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his government and had accepted all extradition requests he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is being delivered for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's approach is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former Staaat President (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemalan Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the subjugation of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This negotiation preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation has been set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of age of the Trinijove social welfare organisation have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than one hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, an event was held in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, where more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened with the risk of marginality.
During yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many of the leaders of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in electoral struggles proved the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol took part in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and current left-green council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the savings bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation”.
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
"The economic crisis is for the association and the work he does, nothing new," he explained.
Occupied house where huge parties were organized was cleared
The houseowners occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve housekeepers left the building yesterday afternoon to have done without resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of House No. 51 on the street Balmes have ended.
Last afternoon, twelve people voluntarily left the building that they held illegally and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the enclosure, the door lock was replaced in order to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house administrator.
The housekeepers who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. In addition, they painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors huge parties were celebrated, which lasted for up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also caused damage.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europe Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the beginning of the household occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure space had been shown by the neighbors because of rest disturbance, while according to their statement the noise was not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers, and especially by the guests of the festivals organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors, have become more and more and more frequent in recent weeks.
The discotheque's controller declared that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called for the building to be cleared immediately last week and to address the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the decline of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the housekeepers had been forced into all the floors of the building in recent months and almost all the apartments. In some it had even come to thefts.
In this sense he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalonian police.
At 3.30 p.m., the police approached the street of Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to invade the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree to the invitation to tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The urban invitation to tender for the 16 goals opens up the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its smear on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many once again became the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that are not spread out in the north-south direction, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
Collserola's classification as a nature park plays with this idea.
As a model, the Central Park was no longer used, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola in September.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that's the way it is, or someone's planning to put gates on the ground.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a reputable topic on which two members of this old caste who can meet in the elevator can access.
And this very fact offers the fabric for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples, is not carried out.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it is not "to be imagined as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas to be traded on."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge", which carries "some dangers".
Risks due to the "uncertainty that today brings the design of a public space" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is the own limitation on what may be built.
"Restricting something always means setting the next step", that is, crossing it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referring to General Metropolitano (PGM)] plan can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is close to the question, believes that simplified, the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "come on deaf ears", although he was grateful to the City Administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "for the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the guide letter enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he says his "doubts" should lead this technical profile to the multidisciplinary teams launched ("just the right one", he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, because in the tendering terms there is a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions written out in the cross section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain lake. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
At least this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip is equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the Plenipotentiary of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is conducted against him because of alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the deputy of Casino Red has given him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which conducts the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, which supposedly forces him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the criminal prosecution, the prosecutors opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniale, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antigua of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organised crime.
On October 19th, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Detention Centre because he had supposedly bribed Casino Red’s owners with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the Central Security District, as murder threats were against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as an inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a warrant for detention, which found that, after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence was presented to accuse Jonás of payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus in order to open it in return.
On this Monday, the Plenipotentiary of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to pass the penalty, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, to the Court, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who had given his leave to the owner of the Wetthaus. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely spoken. Also, there are no claims against the proceedings below, and no compensation is required.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released after hearing the Plenipotentiary of the Wethaus at around 15.50.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be filed.
He also informed him about the court order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident that killed Francisco Blake and another seven people.
The Secretary of the Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat für Kommunikation und Transport in Mexico) informed us that the results of the investigation on the accident involving the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons indicate that the helicopter with its entire unsharpened structure has been shot directly against the ground without the pilot being able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter had been built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area on which the machine had come down.
"When searching no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact was on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On his behalf, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat für Flugge und Hilfeserviceen in Mexico) assured that the Estado Mayor Presidecial helicopter flew on a soft slope at a speed of travel and the aircraft fell on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Vision flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. This means that the team must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, a few deep- suspended clouds emerged.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Spot-on:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter agree. Perhaps there was neither a loss of control over the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight route prior to the impact.
Disperse the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information provided up to now indicates that the helicopter was struck from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted to the ground with its unsharpened structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer neither fire nor explosion at the site of the accident.
The final results of the investigation indicate several soil contactes.
On-site studies have found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The site is off-road and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minimal search in an area that went beyond the restricted area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unsaturated aircraft structure had been sprayed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol on the detection of the non-fatty gene
It is responsible for a research project on the detection of obesity in children and young people, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the genetic markers of obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the IMSS sports facilities in the Mexico Valley, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests are conducted with children and young people.
He stressed that the study began at Cuauhtémoc sports ground (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the Nezahualcóyolt sports ground (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target is reached from 500 to 600 subjects, the study will continue on the Independencia sports ground (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the Morelos (north of the capital district).
He explained that the objective of the study was to identify factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases for children and adolescents.
On the global day of diabetes, he explained that it is hoped that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 should complete, with the consent of and under the supervision of their parents, nutrition-related questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of illness to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
In addition, it showed that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure was controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the basis of the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. The obesity was also dramatically increased," said IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that an average Mexican (e) represented 65 percent Indian-American, 30% European and 5% African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he stated that the genetics of obesity were inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that it would be stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the investigator was in a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and notified to the parents by the doctors in writing. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents impact holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico developed modified asphalt with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs resulting from the pavement were not respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 impact holes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Mexico Valley) broke out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the laying out and maintenance of the pavement was appropriate, the number of impact holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Klagholes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed with polymers modified asphalt to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures.
Mr. Najera thought that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behaviour of the pavement and thus avoid the appearance of impact holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they give the pavement its characteristic zähelastic behavior.
Wheatastic behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is highly viscous and almost fixed at 50°C, while it is brewing at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not the same, but changes one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer explained.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had mostly a flexible pavement composed of six layers of material, including the last three asphalts.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalted and then fortified stones.
Each stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are moved on and forces are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the street floor.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the layer of wear," he explained, "a last layer will be laid out, the so-called layer of leather, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
Those that receive and distribute most of the forces of this road cover also require adequate thickness and material from which they are made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the site becomes wet, water penetrates the layer and occurs only difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and consequently the appearance of impact holes.
When a blowhole occurs," he said, "the cover layer will first be removed, while the wear layer will only be affected after that. However, the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained with the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road covering must always be in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is respected in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research projects were still awaited, for example, via asphalt emulsions, which were even on the market in other countries, with which the impact holes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.

This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winning podium, a silver crown and the band she is a new Miss Colombia to show.
With this night's result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department has already come to 14 mistitles and Melina joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown almost in their hands. Among the alleged abuses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Micica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result is equivalent to the decline of a great favorite who had shown in every performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She had not been elected queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that counts as decisive for the jury's decision to appoint her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "Which book has influenced you most and why?" that had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gomez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize, ultimately I think that the book, which was the strongest for my childhood, 'The little prince', is a very profound book.
I'm currently reading `Schuld und Sühne'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called `Leidenschaften'heist.
One answer, which met little opposition, first because of the term 'civilize' and second because it had not specifically explained in what way each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained how to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people: Read a little 'the little prince'. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite was burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred person to have all the applause and had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had jealously made what the Queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on stage."
And they noticed this at their first show in the bathing suit on the Hilton Hotel beach and at their two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she certainly appeared with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that Magdalena and Atlántico represented.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins most prizes during the competition will eventually not become Queen".
Furthermore, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will have its reason that two days prior to the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. One has to look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense of having already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects in the derangement and fibrosis that she was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutrition habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that there was better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was honestly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine felt that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical intervention she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this price, which is first awarded by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the bathing suit appeared, which was due to be fulfilled at night. Raymundo Melina was deceived that she had given a comfort price in order not to let her get into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that from today Melina begins her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions at the designation of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, has escaped the crown.
Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On the last 4 November, a lophoscopist from Cali, who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), entered "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week, Eliasar González had prepared a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
During the week of operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big was expecting him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take with him the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, didn't wear glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cell and a flashlight, Eliasar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had actually seen it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Search in tracks
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Elias González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Daktyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false ID documents or they have none.
We'll take their fingerprints off and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house at a theft, because the thief had supported himself right at this point with his hand as he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we were able to take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
The fingerprints can also relieve or burden suspects of murder.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of schnapps.
In the investigation, it was assumed that a family member might be suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle was consistent.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take them.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the personal office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without IDs," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything is as it would appear in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything is gold that shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But still, it can be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "impacts" demand the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed together in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
On this Tuesday, the members of the Ocopy Wall Street Movement challenged the New York authorities when they tried again with a court order to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been removed from the square in the morning gray and tried to occupy a different place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed together before the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to provide access to a court order that allowed the "murders" to the new tent at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement remained on the space command and occupied a park farther north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the "impressed" response to the siege of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent clearance of the square and authorising the demonstrators of the tent.
In addition, the "Empörten" occupied a new park, which is located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give precise figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had found themselves at this point in which a deposition of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti site (a private property site) is closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing still scheduled for this Tuesday, and is to be analysed for the legality of the rooms held in the morning gray.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the square carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the square, resulting in "a small clash," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the place as well as the application of "positions adopted after the occupation and forbid that the demonstrators return to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that, as a result of this judicial arrangement, the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the room of the Zuccotti Square in the morning gray, where almost 200 people were arrested, which was decided because the demonstrators "stood the right."
Bloomberg stated that he had given the order to clear the square because he had "transformed himself into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but rather to break the laws and in some cases to inflict harm on others", because "some business would have received threats" and the residents feared "about their quality of life".
"The room in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed them that they were looking forward to organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organisations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have already taken since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary at the TV night show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will perform on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Alls assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas show of Canadian television.
Today, the private television channel CTV announced that Anderson will perform together with the "crooner" (Ballade singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will revive a very special Virgin Mary's life.
Today, CTV distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson - also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-drawn porno in which she appeared together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crue", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator at the mission "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as a Jesus child.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and who is not far away from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had named North American Kim Kardashian as "Hure".
Japan Reborn After the Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, which was still in recovery after the destructive earthquake, which resulted in an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the material damage to $300,000, which seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
According to three quarters of cases, data on gross domestic product from July to September were used to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the annual rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsustainable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual revolution of the Japanese economy is not based solely on key-enhanced attacks that use the crisis to build infrastructure or rebuild it.
Japan is awakened by the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by the growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - has fled into one of the "flight currencies" of investors who, before the eurozone debt crisis and the sad forecasts for the U.S.A., have fled, a privilege that is like a gravestone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the listing of Yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"One must pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid recovery of the Yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very upsetting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing down economic development.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the world economy revealed that the brake would have been drawn at the highest economic potential.
Because he sank by four tenths to loose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone is even below this average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos said the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums from peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also getting lost in the labyrinth that is leading out of the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days that he had appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and not take back his demand for new elections on the scheduled date of February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of civil servants' disciplinary law and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not dispel doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that urgently needs the 8000 million Athens, and he made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment to the fulfilment of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still annoyed by Papandreu referendum due to the effects of the poker game, reaffirmed yesterday that it would not be to blame for its call: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties "would not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the Troika inspectors were "very soon" coming back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what was "needed" for payment of the sixth section of EUR 8000 million", although there is no final date.
The Greek knee still has for a while threads.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position regarding this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the world in the role of microfinance".
Yesterday, Queen Sofía of Spain reminded us that in the last two decades, Spain has developed into a second donor for this resource for international cooperation worldwide. His "Wesen" rests on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all mankind based on human trust".
Yesterday, the Queen dedicated the fifth world summit to microcredits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and "in particular the goal of the number of persons who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, that is, below the "Armuth limit".
Spain continues to "work" at the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions taken by the summit that lasts until Thursday will be "guaranteed the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and, in particular, for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "standing against many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be sought that until the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty threshold.
The concept of microcredit goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago, which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as a "respectable idealist who had committed herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her yesterday the assessment as the "head of the family" in Valladolid and as "presencer of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to search for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Command"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to commit development aid at times of economic booms, since it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that microcredit was a "serious and rigorous poverty eradication policy", and that the governments of the industrialised countries should now "more than ever" work according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the 'most important forms of development aid'.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, slandered "the success", "marginized" people, "always standing in front of closed doors" "Hoffnung" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city who "open their gates, infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
Europe's future was not originally foreseen in the programme, but was enforced in autumn, particularly in order to satisfy those activists who value government policy in relation to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as salmon.
The Presidency proposal proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, ten abstained.
The several minutes of standing Ovation, which were initially regarded by Angela Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, had no doubt on the part of the three European Finance Ministers.
The main idea of the chancellor, as well as the applications, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because millions of jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the chancellor "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected by a strengthening of the European Union's control of the Treaty of Lisbon in relation to the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is certainly one of the proposed proposals adopted by the Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Certainly it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the thing, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, delegates have rejected the proposal to weigh each country in the ECB’s Board of Directors in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously gave rise to a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, who is concerned about the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European application for the importance of "German-French friendship" devotes a section to it, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in health reports?
After family support, UMP and the government are now responding to the health reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November to look for a family aid fund and talk about the - always recurring - issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence from the state since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to subsist on the economy in a hard test, but on the other hand does not represent any less an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports.
First, with budgetary objectives: the government is showing the introduction of a fourth day of career before taking into account a health report to workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that without the approval of the specific company, a affected employee would lose the salary of four days, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to incite anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And those with another measure were more symbolic: to grant the state officials an unremunerated day in the event of illness (until now there is for them, unlike the three days in the private sector, no waiting period).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority of them are also new to the issue of fraud, with this time targeted at the abuse of employment.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition these will be reimbursed if this is requested," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of health reports seem somewhat disproportionate.
Indeed, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives since 2002, which have borne the most frequent fruit.
The French are no longer more ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us start with the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM National Hospital, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Health Institute's economic research and documentation, daily payments amounted to 11.3 billion euros in 2008, 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave and work accidents and 54% for sick leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study conducted by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were admitted on average only 14.5 days in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009.
One average that obscures certain differences: another, in 2007, was published by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 respondents said French workers did not take a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of health reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Thus, compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer prone to incapacity for work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global withdrawal rate (founded by disease or otherwise) was oscillating between 10% and 11% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in health reports is a small part of the problem of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, there is only a small extent to be achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to the existence of systmatic controls for health reports exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public university for the education and training of technicians and engineers) found less than 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term and short-term health reports, i.e. 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically controlled cases of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which are 132,000.
In total, this makes 169 000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have filed a health report.
A figure which represents only a small extent to those of black labour, for example.
According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, that is, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defragmentation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to catch its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before Parliament, adding the fact that the one hundred days granted by his government on the part of the Union did not suffice to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government in its first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the European Council meeting on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, as the country's involvement within the euro area would be "at stake" as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit in order to reduce the 9% of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after this figure was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the measures already approved with regard to an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had been sent in advance that his party would not be ready for an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at the time of a new democracy party assembly.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but he was opposed to any policy that would prevent the economic upturn.
Olli Rehn, a Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of over EUR 8 billion without written guarantee to all parties on their support of the planned measures, said Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanying free-death must be legalized, so an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows.
The board explained that governments, institutions of health care and doctors cooperated with regard to pain relief treatment in order to provide the best pain relief measures, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is taking place, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As an opening, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU that compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globeball.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the theme of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of Canadians ’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
Over the whole country, the rate is highest at 86% of hospital deaths in Quebec.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that there are no amendments to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalized Euthanas and accompanying suicides, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would induce abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unqualified or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are a lot more cases of such violations, particularly in those countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report yesterday, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remember that according to an Angus-Eide survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already smoked in favor of Euthanasia, as they believe that at the end of their life they allowed people to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact that euthanasia is legalised does not lead to the message being conveyed that the lives of older or disabled people have less value.
With regard to the persons who have already practised an accompanying suicide, respondents at 41% feel that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or discontinuation of medicines in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the cancellation of the funds for which a legal rejection has been requested should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the decommitment of the means at the end of their lives, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The board explained that governments, institutions of health care and doctors worked together in the area of pain relief to provide the best pain relief measures, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the panel called on at least to consider the means of pain relief or life-absorbing measures already widely used in the Canadian institutions for health care, as they did not help to reduce physical pain, nor did euthanasia, nor did they interfere with the same procedures.
Responsibilities of other experts
Some experts in the field of public health have already presented reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as, among other things, "extreme" because they set no limits to euthanasia practice in the final phase of health care.
"This opens the door to a situation in which everyone who is life-tired and older than 18 years is asking another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility over all the other values involved in the social work of society.
But now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, Health Law Specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she called "Pro-Euthanation Manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, has doubts in particular about the reports concerning the non-compliance of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls for President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a "Complott"
Syria is visibly more isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assads demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria's Bashar al-Assads, however, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "competition" directed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's Syrian exit, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of a resignation from President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the ruling Arab prime minister, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his power in Syria," in which already around forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"Lage Baschar the interest of his country in the heart, he would resign, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, had complained that Turkish mediation attempts against the Syrian regime had not been successful since the beginning of the year.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be content with this need to go," he explained in reference to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is constantly taking a harsher attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "enhancement of the consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, Arab League and countries such as Turkey have made an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria were killed, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in Homs' besieged city, "Schussversichten und schwarten Bombenschaffen um Jobar".
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country's "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded emphatically to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added under the charge that "the plot forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed his support for sending UN observers to protect civilians from regime repressions that later encapsulate him in his "Paranoia".
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November to speed up the crisis, in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of the military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lawrow identified the Arab League's decision yesterday as "uncorrect" in order to avoid the support of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis withdrawal plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian head of government, has called for a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that demands "sacrifice" to regain the creditworthiness lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's trade unions and employers' union meeting.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups involved in the discussions after meeting with the President-in-Office.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had waited, on his side, for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a strike list presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, with the comment that it was "safe that markets would prove to be robust and understanding".
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister in office was to set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, so he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has undertaken to make Italy a "renewable protagonist" in Europe in all urgency within the meaning of the objective since it was taken up.
A spokesperson of Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even the new government does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013, despite the austerity plans taken over in recent months, has in particular applied for new key issues.
Emma Marcegaglia "Chefin der Chefs" Italy, which will meet on Monday, also insists on the need for economic stimulus "because a country that has no growth that cannot respect the deficit figures."
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoch Exchange" of Italy after 17 years "Berlinusconism", the "Professor" symbolises the "proclaim of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown were the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, as Italy has raised 200 billion euros of government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Wyatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, thus confirmed on Monday a US NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) as well as other documents from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, the Danilenko born in 1934 had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the centre to set up a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamond".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only most involved in this technology but also, as one member of the Agency announced, had worked his entire professional career on this technology directly on the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes directed against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to FBI statistics published on Monday, either slightly decreased or increased slightly in the same period.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims had risen from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in the number of crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total figure of hate-motivated crimes has increased to 6,628 cases in very weak measure, including 47.3% of racially motivated crimes and 20% of those motivated by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the human rights organisation Human Rights First. "The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of the law against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The US government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, considering that this could be carried out in an improved police attitude towards "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" is an inheritance in American federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also involves crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
On Monday, the Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" allow more readable live tracking of the activities of other "twitterers", the Internet user whose messages ("tweets") are being tracked and your messages are being tracked.
This enables them to find out whether they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, to favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested at a small percentage of users on Monday" in August before its general Internet distribution," said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esotherian suggestive wording (RT for referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utiliser) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and equal to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" feature will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," announced @dandykronstrom.
Austria
entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution;
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic Coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-Bonity (AA).
It was personally the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt in Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay would not be reduced to AA+ at a time, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria is also calling for the Eurozone Member States' Brussels Summit of 26 October: Heads of State or Government would at that time have requested the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government for this purpose is similar to the "German model" since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) per year, and from 2017 onwards, the state's structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% GDP threshold, whereas the regional states and municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention on the monetary markets
On Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that if the Yen continued to rise, the Japanese government would intervene again on the currency markets.
"If we want to establish excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate", we will intervene just as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, however, the Yen was speeding up close to the historical levels that had forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
On that day, Tokyo had sold Yen massively for dollars to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is in the process of setting a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has increased regularly over it, baptised by the purchases of investors who see the yen as "flight value" in these unsafe times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar noted by 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This Japanese foreign exchange blast fire harms the Archipelago's exports as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights for its reconstruction after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (North-East)," emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that the Yen's fervour could already kill the weak upswing in the germ.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, has again gained power for the first time this year thanks to the jump in export growth and the consumption of the "stomped" households due to the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that Yen's expensiveness does not reflect "Japan's economic foundations".
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday to take all possible measures to disarm the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, has announced that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", thus leaving it to be stated that no additional currency closure should be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) that it had spent on various purchases of financial titles in order to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Quick interest rates up, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermined by European indicators.
Despite the adoption of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, are also drifting a little further into negative fillets on this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 o'clock and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Because of the new tensions with regard to government bond yields in the euro area in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to publish some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Press Office Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffered from the renewed fear of European market players in capacity, that the debt crisis continued to persist, had closed with a resolution of 0.7%.
""Japan has turned his eyes to Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving on a limited range corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the euro zone damages the single currency which continues its Baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it yielded 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered in Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's lending rates remain very worrying.
This Tuesday morning, the Italian bond yield reached 6,85%, and the Spanish title matured to 6,2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, as well as in France, continue to nourish investors' fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by the loss of debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the visor of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has again reached a new historical high.
Expecting growth figures for the euro area
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE statistical office had revised the Baisse figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany had experienced a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate of the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If an issue exists that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a vote on this issue and to think about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it breaks down the whole range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, it is not necessary to give up a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision on the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to join its park another unit by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model is occasionally set as a model for renewable energy sources, reality is contrary to discourse.
The election in Berlin will take the form of an increase in electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence on imported gas, particularly Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unsatisfied effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, a European wind energy leader, accounting for 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, it is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; on the other hand, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness and in the stability of the industry on a national basis, the French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which will lead to the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power for illusion.
Surveys revealed that this was a price that the large majority of French people are not prepared to pay as little as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Let us bear in mind that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it and the annual EUR 6 billion in investment goods and nuclear energy exports would increasingly shrink.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its producer is preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one has to admit that there is no wonder that there is no more than a devil's work to produce electricity.
The low CO2 solutions developed by Areva to use nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that performs uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the security performance.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; so he went without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction as well as indebted human failure.
With Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never occurred, causing the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design that enables them to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by allowing them to travel the lead position in themselves in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had called it.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had influenced the weekly shows by the official side, the Minister of the Interior had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needs no talent, mason or waitress from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this subject between the right and the left.
On the right hand, Jacques Chirac's tone, who had declared in 1976 that "900.000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrants, should not pose a problem for a country", was sounded by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, "can't absorb the world's entire poverty".
There is only one difference in the degree of flexibility
The fear of national soil invasion by horden of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 by both right and left.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of flexibility that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande, in his programme, is limited to banalities that point to partnership development allowing us to solve our "migration problems".
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the notion that they threaten to substitute local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than local wage earners, as they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are untaxable at work.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which are less attractive to local wage earners, who are more qualified among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not equal to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and the domestic labour market between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flows leads to a co-related, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this does not take into account the fact that the variety of ideas added by immigrants and economic growth (higher proportion of immigrant immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in European countries on average about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that a person who immigrates to the public budget at the age of 30 after Germany will, on average, make a net contribution (in revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to create the missing intersections "with the teeth" on the occasion of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remind itself of those who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had suffered the tragedy of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, of Salazars in Portugal and of the Supreme One in Greece.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in a way that was as direct as possible, in order to see democracy prevail over their enemies once and for all.
It is known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient for this, and can be as good as the "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe that we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek True False referendum would have had a double revealing character in this respect: once the need for a vigorous return of politics, on the other hand, but also for the alarming feeling of their impossibility, their inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organized in accordance with the needs and in the wrong order.
A release for the European single ruler or a leap with associated eyes into the void of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacking bees, but rather a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constant, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one knows no more where to end the census - because there is only one crisis, and it exists in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is subject to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its lack of power and solidarity.
It is all of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - the whole of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so every one of its nations.
The urgent need is to give people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the whole body to decide whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start up a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has to be conditional upon decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy without us being sure to destroy them.
After this proposal has been debated for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is pressing for European economic governance.
Agreed.
But without political integration and stronger democracy, as proposed by the citizens, it would be a new folly and a further deadlock.
We need to take a new stage in European integration.
In order to make the Republic come into existence in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone was not enough here.
This guidance remains valid.
We must form a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become the general good
The World Chip Card Fair opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in world sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or the settlement of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Its market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after a long period of pressure from the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, make steam.
Therefore, this year Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out their customers bank cards with contactless chip," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A declining small percentage of equipment has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
"They've been delayed."
"But at least next year they should experience a real upward development."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to the next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the launch of an offer that would enable its customers to make contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front is understood, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long suspected relations between the Al Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to confirm themselves.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-President Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers has now acquired "certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and the relations of secret services indicate clear cooperation," he explained without going further into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have supported interfaces to days.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, who were kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, are to have been killed at the same time on the following days as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several telephone chips in the ruins at the site that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to an Nigerian, who had stopped the cradle of Boko Haram for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but you have to wait for clearer evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's conceivable."
"For years it has been known that the sect has received financial and intellectual support from Außen and that it is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more obvious in their course, as have the speeches and operations modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the addition of suicide bombers as well as the use of ever more complex explosives carrying the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has exerted pressure on Abuja to start with Washington to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the grouping to be a community of illuminati for a long time, which should not be given any particular attention.
Faster Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a disgrace" in Haoussa - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirat in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for Sharia, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially have churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their reinforced attacks against the Commissioners.
The reaction by Abuja, however, is as usual indifferent.
The army encircles the city, you count 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was captured in prison, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an attack in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is assigned the guilt of a suicide attack that took place in the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local seat becomes the main international target.
The formation of an African terrorist axis, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has alarmed all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied the Somalis of al-Shabaab operating in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned Jonathan about Boko Harem in Nigeria during a conversation with President Goodluck in Nigeria and was ready to announce all the information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and the assistance of Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple to say not: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates in this way, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have been repeating their thundering statements and their statements about foreign policy, traditional Republican focus.
China, Iran and Israel help fall - often in no way supported - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", which is the highest in the class, Mid Romney threatened to quote Chinese people before the WTO and to expose them to the leading issue of "method manipulation" in an America that has been raging to Asia through the emigration of the entire industry.
He said it went dumb if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost aired down in regard to his emotion-swimmering gesture.
He had called for a handful but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of the polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear programme should fail.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he had tinned.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
Furthermore, he promised Israel strengthened military aid and charged Obama with remaining guilty of obligations to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, a second-highest-placed candidate, is showing a shameful act ignorance.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be counter-contra, since Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay more attention to the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is ready to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 retreat to torture measures against the suspected terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an extra-political weight.
The current presidential opponents opposed that Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They call to mind that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which was the subject of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive interlocutory talk with Iran, the premature withdrawal of its "youth" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This insult, however, is not quite so uncompromising.
The population estimates rather the positive balance of National Security under Obama, who eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to bring its leadership to a new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Northern Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea seabed and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with glory and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea Coast under orchestral sounding and fine taster buffet the inauguration of the new Northern Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea level.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, symbolically combined with the wheel of the valve, which carries the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km length, linking the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line ring on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any trassage by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country road.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it is now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to conclude access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not back in time to compare the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Swietchen Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of strengthening European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In almost five years, Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are negated.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also important from political and economic sides.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers representing many gas lines in Lubmin.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete coating which is intended to protect it from anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at about 200 m depth.
In its construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be eliminated.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be carefully removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, reinforced measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, which has been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was provided for off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have waived because the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company permanently located at the level of their coasts.
"In the case of a havari, we close the gas flow in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In the event of leaks, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be little likely, since the welding seams were estimated to be a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both an underwater robot controlled for external observation by a seagoing vessel and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring one metre diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of movement through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible metal deformations upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo only the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each to 15.5%), as are the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (each to 9%).
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has then rented out the entire capacity of its gas transport on the renewable Twentieth-Year Treaty.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter's amount of gas falls off," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of gas pipelines was secured to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour cost should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the liability risk.
The gas pipeline rises on a sandy coastal stretch with pine trees forested by Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas outlet platform.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine now wants to restore new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight spent hours writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, as it has aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as you know today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided at the time to place a distincted design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's specialist consultant, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfskin), which refers to a cotton bag, which is used, for example, for covering upholstery benches.
This kind of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten subject, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artist," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsor at Modo Modo.
Success begins.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales are increasing by 26% and are building up with a sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open minded customers.
The small Italian company, which was 12 employees in its early years, employs over 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of the e-mails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trajectory is accompanied by the development of Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a Leopards-designed cover on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural spirit and understood it to diversify his products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer cases... The brand shows the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, which opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Depressing?
"No, this is how Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, emphasizes the "week of work for the disabled".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not double, but triple that high."
"Not so much remains to be done."
It must be said, however, that for disabled people, there are still many obstacles before they get a job.
It is more common for the elderly: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no Abitur and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
In conclusion, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled, compared with 38% in the total.
In short, there are so many criteria which make it difficult to start work again and which make up the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the practical brakes.
Keep the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which, while certain, but slowly evolve.
A study carried out in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the journal La Cité stated that the managers interviewed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled", which is "overrepresented" by persons in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually disadvantaged".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment objective of 6% disabled workers, as laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now in charge of 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, of the organisation responsible for making contributions from companies that disregard this law.
Proof: The number of "paying" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, ranging from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also gives a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ between 20 and 49 disabled persons, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not disguised their pleasures, which brought them the game of friendship.
It would be too much to say that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the viewer's podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been good and happy to conclude peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian National Trainer had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller on his part.
Regarding the contrast between his presentation in club and national elite "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to get started."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania as regards the match against France to finally shine".
However, without leaving the note of "joy".
He has been cheering the French national team since the age of seven, and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked over the road."
"To be allowed to play them means great happiness!"
Leeken's sounding "Stolz" was good on his part.
"The pride of a Galamach."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its capacity as a "neighbourhood" - that France" has again become a team at a very high level," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a hell of a good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician is very likely to share the aircraft with the Blues (the French Nationalelf) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry".
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game involved against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward with great optimism to the replay against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Both teams had failed in the playoffs.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elite, for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship 2012.
In fact, this means only 90 minutes of happiness for Portugal.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the game more than an hour clearly, but the team was unable to put the matter to the very important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved an exit gate."
At home, however, in its brightly radiant stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will be able to get across to an audience who might be just as close to the game, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very scarce", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship", however, the relative of Carlos Queiroz's successor.
On Friday's vote in Bosnia, Portuguese forces them to achieve and win a goal.
A decision may already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not made a goal out," regrets Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have preferred to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians already at the beginning to "give no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
