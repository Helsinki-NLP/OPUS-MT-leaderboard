Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title in 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament) is an indignant one.
This is why plans are being made to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target disc of the spot.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp” rhymes.
For non-walic readers: in Welsh, 'twp' stands for 'doof' and 'pwp' for 'aa'.
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between 'MWP' and 'Muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which currently drafts a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on designations for the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which produced broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs board preferred the option of "MWP" at a public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the ringing of a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is to present a draft law within weeks, could pose a problem.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour means that this right is based on Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I was talking to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today, both are no longer there."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood in which people regularly find themselves."
At the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders of the church assume, and that they will "be back to the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condos in which people do not support the remaining places of refuge.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condoms in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these mansions will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community withdrew in the 1930s.
A black church that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott by retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support black people.
At a fire in 1939 the building was badly damaged, but when Father Johnson's parish members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was 18 years ago turned into the larger bell game in Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been partially attracted by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the bishops diocese.
In July, the head of the parish – the municipal governing body consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns over the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the head of the community, although it was not involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency on the diocese side.
Hai hurts in California 13-year-olds diving to praise
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the praises season, a shark has officially attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving to praisers.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the station KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and paddled to the boy with several others to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he had first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser. But then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When he came to the boy's house, he found that his entire key leg had been torn up.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation purposes and for security reasons.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans advances on the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacking department of cosmetics that are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, super drug and Debenhams.
In the context of a large-scale advance on the 2.8 billion UK pound cosmetic market in the UK, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in eleven branches across the country. If they prove successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for opportunities to use previously for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of its cosmetics offer doubles for the first time up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique", so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfumer will be tested in two Sainsbury's stores. Last week, the first sales point was opened in Croydon, South London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase small food quantities in local supply stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to make customers visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food articles tries to fight against the discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos stores two years ago and also a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales as well as the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a discussion on the distribution of revenues from drug dealers' stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch of extensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, as in four branches an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche Posay and Vichy is added.
Paul Mills-Hicks, business director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the convenient locations we are now an attractive target for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones "wonderful" after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business worth 11 million pounds
"Dragons" The Star Peter Jones is "wrong" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den-Star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand business to focus on her own new connection agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been 'wrong' when the 'golden girl' of television admitted, at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, because of their new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – to no longer be able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would have probably doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million UK pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his vacation rentals.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a surprise to all those involved.
Nobody could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
At the station in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, which is one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions of dollars due to high investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added in March as chairman.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to be a brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A Jones nearby source said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He scoffed at the criticism he had of the news media for a comment that some would regard as 'not presidential' and for so positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said to copy the voice of a message moderator:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a great step towards the democratisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denunciation have come to an end.
More than three months after the June Singapore Summit, Ri Yong Ho, the senior diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "reaction" of the US on North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he concluded, the US imposed sanctions that should keep the pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages and the repatriation of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after Lombok's earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international support, so this is a bit difficult," said Summing.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
Faced with the landslides with which Indonesia has to fight constantly, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural violence.
While in Aceh Tsunami shelters were built, these are no everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The tsunami-warnsirene in Palu, despite an apparent failure to come into force, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Traveling between Indonesia's numerous islands is already an ideal challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A Lasarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the injured Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election of Joko is suffering from funding deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from persistent confiscational tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes, when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation strikes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the Stamford-Bridge Stadium in London with a hit in the 89th minute before a prime league loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1-back of his team at about 27 meters from Chelsea gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the rear post.
The shot sailed high across the penalty room and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I’ve just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge versus LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
After a 25 minute hit by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard, Chelsea led to a half-life of 1:0.
The blues stormer gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double game in the middle field.
After that, he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard entered the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defensemen behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the Champions League group phase on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is opposite the UEFA Europa League Videoton in London on Thursday at 15:00.
Number of deaths of Tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that were brought to a crash by the earthquake of strength 7.5 from Friday, which had caused up to six meters of waves, reported Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was endowed with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with sting wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police ask the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I would ask anyone who has stayed close to John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken up something with a dashboard, to contact us. They may have information that is of utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon friends who believe to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police reported that they are informing the victim's next members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard how a police officer told a man that now the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved in the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, "This is so terrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were in charge of the housing block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call number 101 or to turn anonymously to Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 and to refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest monument to the dispute over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-remembering destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art products by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'tourness' and 'trying to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell was the goal of the palace of Westminster.
The picture tower in the English Civil Wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's prevailing opinion and part of the history of a figure that is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday telegraph: “Cromwell is more defended by many, perhaps the end of the 19th century than today, than someone who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course through the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate presentation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single identifiable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a Southwest market in China.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a steeped artery flooded in the vicinity of a pig stable on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines from pigs in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005.
According to reports, he arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stable was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilo pig had killed the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, to whom the surname "Wu", was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to Yuan's family and the market authorities, reports on compensation for his death are negotiated.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to contaminate the animal.
After a farmer was fed by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC news that pigs were usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a "suspensioner".
“They’re just playful.
They like to grow and are very curious, ... they're not about to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Pink bring widespread strong rains in the Southwest of the USA
As forecasted, Hurricane Rosa weakens along the way over the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, bring floods to northern Mexico and the Southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock East Coast time, pink wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a hurricane category 1, were 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a Trog begins to form over the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the USA. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is transported northwards to the south-west of the USA.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of precipitation on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical moisture produces widespread rainfall in the southwest by interactions with the attracting trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flutters, splashes in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity sometimes leads to rainfall rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation are expected.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Faced with the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can cause the flow of canyons, and thunderstorms bring local windbows and wind that brings dust.
The nearby trough brings local strong rains into parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of more than one centimeter may result in small amounts of bulkheads and smooth lanes in the water.
This would be the first precipitation of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the Tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the US.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the continuing summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm October beginning with wide temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above average temperatures in the first half of October in the East.
Over 20 million spectators have seen Brett's hearing Kavanaugh
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday at six television networks the captivating statements by Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, TV stations interrupted their regular program because of a change in the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, she had been harassed and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen saw the hearing.
The company determined the average viewer numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring viewer numbers in offices.
To put this into the right perspective: This is similar to the audience numbers in a play-off football game or in the Oscar rental.
According to Nielsen, according to Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, an average of 5.69 million spectators of the full-day hearing recorded the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by cameras by CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as Protestants were loudly harassing him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for minutes with a reduced view while he was being trained. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you believe that he is telling the truth to the land?"
"They have power, while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and added before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing in front of the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later, when the Justice Committee should vote on the transmission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote on the Senate as a whole.
Flake said, however, that he would only do so on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, will investigate the accusations against the candidate next week.
Flake was convinced partly by interlocution with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the accusations made against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused critics of her plans for leaving the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called 'Chequers Plan' for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the reciprocal imposition of duties by the UK and the EU as 'public absurd'.
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police capture suspects Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested for death by Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that the glasses had been found on Simpson's DNA.
After a survey by Simpson, the police reported that he was standing the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound at the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police's forensic lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their support in the arresting investigation.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Enforcement Authority for 'their care and their quest for justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was 'deeply shaken' about Wayde's death and 'be under shock'.
"One is always afraid of such a thing," said Wade.
Volcano spews ashes on Mexico City.
Moved out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater had increased and within 24 hours 183 gas and ashes were recorded.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of shivers and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists, since September 2017, had shaken an earthquake of the strength of 7.1 Central Mexico, recorded increased activity at the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police-Catalan separatists clash before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence protesters. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were held back by the preparedness police, purchased them with eggs and also covered them with paint powder, so that dark dust clouds developed into the normally populated streets of tourists.
In the next day, there were also handcuffs with the police who used their batons to contain the fights.
For several hours, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had been scanning 'No forget, no forgiveness', while they opposed Unionists calling 'Long live Spain'.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
The voters had opted for independence with an overwhelming majority, although voting was low, as the dismembering opponents mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulties this year to maintain the momentum. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in detention, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been fought by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and oppression by the Spanish Government is to take action," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit several times by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after the British summer season.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, the car may have been shot with an armbrust.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0-victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Hits proved decisive for Gary Holt's team being able to match Hibernian in the second half of the season.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season with no outstretched victory and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers were host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt has not suffered any defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities against freely playing guests
Holt's team should have been in charge long before the hit, because his directness put the Rangers before the most different problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but got slower in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was shot down to hit Craig Halkett's headshot by the gate.
The hosts were content to let the rangers play in front of themselves, as they knew that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came about.
The Rangers gave a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance for Declan Gallagher and Robinson to shoot Menga together. He shot the gate with a ball contact from the centre of the prison room.
During this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the host's defense, and Torhüter Liam Kelly remained largely unholy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced him to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers' rearguard Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow passed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Fleken repeatedly entered the Liveston penitentiary and was regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two requested criminal offences – one of the Halkett's competitors against the changed Glenn Middleton and one because of hand-playing – were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their way of playing and their team has hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way in which he wakes up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on trot during the entire game.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard at times, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was inadequate – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and this is something like a wake call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the government chiefs of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to help repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons for her holding a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also made their voices heard. They condemned Erdogan’s policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the visitor's polarizing effect, praised by some German Turks as a hero and reproached by others as autocrats.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclists die when collapsing with car
When a car collided with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision took place at about 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the medics took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers away from the Saturday accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to notify his next relatives.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured at unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. of British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and stopped.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to end the unrest in which eight inmates are involved and are confined to a wing.
The officials were treated on the spot for minor injuries on the face.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison personnel were used to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers are handed over and may spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of prison was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October of last year, officials were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (duration areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Pink draw over the desert-shaped southwest and bring with it the risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as on the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of rainfall with up to 15 centimetres in the Mogolon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimeters and can be separated up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who do not have the risk of floods, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently taking place in the south-west.
According to the U.S. Dryt Monitor, at least an extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First of all, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move to the north with 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible", saidweather.com.
Then Rosa will move northward as a tropical storm over Mexico, on early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression reaching the border with Arizona and then moving up to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
The National Hurricane Center was informed of "The main danger is expected in connection with Rosa or its remains in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwestern part of the United States marked by deserts".
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods are expected in the desert and in the water-driving rubble as well as in mountainous areas of landslides.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with sting wounds in Somerset, three boys in the teens and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teen was found injured on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. of British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered "under the common, the anger" of the Democrats during the whole nomination process.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the congress and rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had harassed her sexually decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also made a statement on her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh this day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the public," he said the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not responding, but I'm actually acting," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission 'to resist and block'.
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday at the latest, said a senior member of the GOP leadership versus CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, victim numbers rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away as a result of a severe earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi massive waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people met on Friday at a feast on the beach of Palu, when, when darkness broke down, up to six meters high waves hit the beach and killed many people and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami had preceded an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the Tsunami threat came to light yesterday, people still went to the beach and ran away from it immediately and they fell victim to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Authority BNP at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, trunks and houses, he hit on land everything," said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
Some people were climbing trees on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aeronautics published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and crashed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that the energy released during the massive quake of Friday was equivalent to the 200-fold energy of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Because of the location of the city at the end of a long narrow bay the tsunami could have grown, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had fallen.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of fallen buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast could have been 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
According to Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was totally paralysed, and there was no information.
According to an explanation of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," said the explanation.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticised for not informing that a tsunami had met Palu, although the waves were reportedly received at the time of the warning.
In social media published amateur photos show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him against the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water on the shore and floats buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
As a result of the quake and the tsunami, there was a massive power failure that interrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for assistance measures.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo to Evacuation Centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have certainly reached the city of Palu, where the employees in tent accommodation are accommodated in the courtyard of their office, but after saying Dosebas passed on the road to scenes of destruction.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to initiate disaster relief, some of them realized that professional foreign helpers would be hindered on their journey to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
"At the moment there is another disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but until now this status does not apply.”
During the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday fell over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing for this hoped for one of the miracles that light up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a sewer tunnel.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been confined under debris for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that had ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Others in the Roa-Roa hotel were prisoners, as Mandigi added, his students.
"As a senior at Paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told us how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders had been reported, WhatsApp sent news to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, only led to grey question marks instead of blue ticks.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 while cashing a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release by Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Thiebe, an employee of Brink’s stole a $26,750 ATM filling out.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came behind the staff of Brink’s” and stole a sack full of money that was intended for the machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact Newport Police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known beings as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been named Ye for some time and has used him as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He acts as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not just a abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has religious significance for West, according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘Ye’ has become a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects more than what we are."
He's one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which West used to work together, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military would never be used to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves in all Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
US should double funding for artificial intelligence
In view of the increased activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this field, says Investor and AI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so much behind the US, we are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of financial resources could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest placed American Othello player. Later, he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored former US government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked after the time of the next competition, as he wants to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read words, researchers in the US often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away academic excellence, but companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have stopped Koryphaes from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
"I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the area of AI-sponsored people," he said.
In July 2017, the China State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations to grant funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where partners from industry and science should be involved. Furthermore, the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced the investment of USD 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than 100 million US dollars annually in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to the 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'; this measure would be accompanied by a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it is entitled to the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has introduced a veto against the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority population of Macedonia.
President Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt that the vote would reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev is a member, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, the entry into organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, many Members of this House have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The name change would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on the change of the country name that Macedonia would open the way to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54 Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, voting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first heavy blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its seizure of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvered by the entire Brighton defense to achieve goal
On Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defensemen and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defenseman and then overtaken several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton doorkeeper and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he achieved a goal at that moment."
It was Sterling, however, that gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net, shortly before it slipped into the outing.
City plays in the Champions League team game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim vs. Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the Rockies the game
As the nationals were excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another action.
However, the perpetrator always hopes to stand on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies on the hill, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which Playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw as we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals haven't announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they tend to throw jokes in such a situation according to reports.
Scherzer, for which this was the 34th bet as a starter, practised in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
This season, the Washington court has a statistic of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump stops rallying in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation relating to the Brett Kavanaugh, chosen by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of Republican voters in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I don't stand for it, but I'm actually up for it, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, you see the commonness, the abominableness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to cross to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission 'to resist and block'.
'And you see this in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'abominable and mean and disgusting and dishonest'.
He called it the highest democracy in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered outbursts in the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you let the document come out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions to apply.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this was not surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had been energetic against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised by the request for a different opinion from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that 'the meetings should all be inclusive and productive'.
Most of the GC meetings on Friday evenings in my eight years as a local Labour Member were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'kinder, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged accordingly whether they are accepted by the party's head.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party. Colleagues, with whom I once believed to share similar political views, were now expecting me to make a turning point and to take positions with which I would otherwise not have agreed – whether it was with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a chimphirade follows in the social media calling for my election, denouncing the political centre and saying that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with that experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better off than some of my colleagues, since the comments directed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who, in the daytime, face a flood of sexist or racist abuses and yet never admit little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that abuses have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn demanded last week that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of censure and any change to the electoral rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have often been advised not to raise my mind and express my opinion so clearly, and then I would 'have no problems'.
But I did not go to politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the overall school literally fell apart, the Labour Party joined, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a municipal council as well as as cabinet minister.
I have never made a heel out of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: given the fact that the country will rush on a Brexit, that it will harm households, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I do not address this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many electoral threats or political intentions will not deter me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been put to the test in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have used their chances better than we do."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught an unincreased attempt.
Climo expanded the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he scored a hit directly in the mid-term and then made an increased attempt alone, so that it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, began the second half of the time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After a long break due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his advantage by a trial of Stafford McDowall increased by Climo.
Then, at the end of a phase, the captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card, and once again Melrose, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, paid the additional man by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty street behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as much since the break-up, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxing kick had been intercepted and flanker Gregor Henry had sent off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” Star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
“Still Game” Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the hospitality industry after he turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and K seems to run a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of A driftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that K run was interested in getting into Glasgow's "florish restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": The Bolivian enclaved by land hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Matrosen patrol before the navy headquarters decorated with tauwerk in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet base points from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout the country, the memory of the coastal section lost in a bloody conflict around resources in the 19th century in Chile is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice to be held on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the IGH’s judgment on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic discussions to negotiate about a sovereign access to the sea by Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in the verdict on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorised to address Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was "not complicated" that IGH had been given six months after the final plea.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also be a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has torn the question of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' military rhetoric has suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will someday continue their talks, but after these events this becomes extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had fallen abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia 'has an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile' and an opportunity to 'make an end to the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit', he said.
Calzadilla also contends that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is a chance to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if she can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about three months after the summit with the head of state of North Korea Kim Jong-un in Singapore to re-launch nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the US against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the North into its knees, as "brain sparing."
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without Pjöngyang taking significant disarmament steps first.
Kim as well as US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngyang is serious about the absence of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazily big head coverings for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations over the race path.
Valentino's most outstanding piece was an extravagant bicolored hat with a feathery wide edge that pressed the heads of the models straight.
As other oversized accessories, watermelons, a magician hat and even an pineapple were shown with jewels, but these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were embroidered and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted estuary.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The superdimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a width of 60 centimeters, all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which hit large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the footpath: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the one bathing suit model that held the bag.
The reddish orange Bastfransen and a white leather heel was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus's summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for next summer. The designer has excited so much that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be characterised by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with outstanding results and is supported only by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their pupils and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their pupils for training and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a sector of education, which can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought-after in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak with him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved grade A during the higher tests.
From the data collected by 74 ScIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved grade A during the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students who learned German reached 69 percent of the students who learned French and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also scored grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons given by employers for the problems of hiring open jobs were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future occupation.
As more and more open jobs require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Independently of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a lead before competitors.
According to a youGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak well enough foreign language to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more traditional modern languages, while other languages will be taught which, with a view to 2020, are considered the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, in independent schools, a number of languages with corresponding specialized teachers will always be available.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, regardless of the future.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country. Therefore, this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers' debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James join the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait will soon end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason.
However, how many minutes he is going to play is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after training for his plans for the six games of the lakers' comprehensive preseason playing schedule.
"I don't need preseason games to prepare myself in this phase of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of electoral campaigns.
This is the first demonstrations planned by Trump for the next week, among others in well-being places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the Vakanz at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of the board nominated for the Supreme Court on allegations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in the silence for up to one week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of announcements is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult choice in a November.
That is why President Trump's election campaign team told Reuters that these five rallyes will be used next week to mobilize volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to obtain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
"Congress control is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible while the operational electoral season is approaching," said a Trump election speaker who did not want to call his name Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, in the rally planned for tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate and report media from Pittsburgh".
The visit to Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, surveyed.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him up in the polls," said Simon Haeder, Politologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the USA shows willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum's pendulum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum in her opinion now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now it's four, I think that's a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth leaving the venue.
Europe is, of course, in the best interest and is ahead of us four points, while twelve more follow.
According to Spieth, however, Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from dropping to green and progressed with good example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams were louder in the further course of his round when he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had laid down for two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not yet out of play.
"I really have to get in and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that remains for each player.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and therefore undoubtedly wrote the history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the apparent amount of flowing energy between them and the omitted amount reinforces that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory at the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning who played together with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and Sweden into a terminal, which they could not easily overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the terminal.
The four and four pairings are so fascinating from a distance because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the US team is ready for battle, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe is going in the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four-seaters and four-seaters, Europe is ahead from Saturday to the USA with 10:6 and takes a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the troublesome Tiger Woods and was able to book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to recover the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four of the four in the morning against the faulty American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the US made more resistance and won two matches, but failed to recover.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while Molinari and Molliwood, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmoniously beat the enchanted Woods and the American Neuling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more powerful 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning of the four, returned and played the four-parts as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day in the southwest of Paris, not everything ran according to their ideas.
The triple Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory in the fours over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-part 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only appeared twice that a team came back after it had gone into the single with a backwardness of four points. However, as a title holder, Fryk’s team has a choice to keep the trophy.
After they've only been in second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that last year North Korea "has taken substantial action" and, for example, stopped nuclear and missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself not to amplifying nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we do not see the response of the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be able to equip ourselves one-sidedly first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to the democratization in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed to be significant in that it did not reject a one-sided democratization from before, as Pjöngyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. In this, Kim had pledged to work on the "Denuclarization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war which took place from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjöngyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes demands for a relaxation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first democratization" and increases pressure by sanctions in order to achieve its goal by force, and is even opposed to the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain sparing of those who know nothing about us.
The problem is, however, that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the head of state of South Korea Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were to be the other party instead of the US on the issue of democratisation, the democratization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to an end."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to aim with North Korea's missiles on the USA's mainland, after "the evil president" Trump called Kim " rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year Trump, who had threatened last year with the "general destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim to the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament steps. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's democratisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngig for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be pursued vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denunciation."
Since 2006, the Security Council has stepped up sanctions against North Korea in order to financially dry out Pjöngigang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, on his departure from Pjöngyang, he said that progress had been made only to be accused hours later of being accused by North Korea that he had made 'gosday-like demands'.
North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month when the United States took 'appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the intended 'similar measures' were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year during their basic studies. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture to keep themselves awake with caffeine and to learn all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and in his opinion is the first such course in the USA.
He was inspired to launch the course after holding a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At the end a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I only know about it now, in my last year?’
According to their words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after she had found that students had suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section the students see the image of a room in a home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporty performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged by a map of the university site with interactive symbols to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how smoking affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night shift" was still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
He said that the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be sufficient to ensure good sleep. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation plunged the brain into hunger mode, making them ever hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year he finished one of his courses in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes to him and encouraged him to press for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, the students should set themselves a wake-up alarm for the sleep time and the waking time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which is due to electronic screens and LED lighting and can remove the circadian rhythm. This leads to problems during sleep.
Livingstone vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor defeated Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outing game when Dolly Menga's match for Steven Gerrards represented a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book their first outing since the 4:1-triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind in the Ladbrokes Premiership with far leading Hearts.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the inspirational poor Rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingstone rises to the third place and lies only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further troubles after the line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overcame Ayr and reached the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week and would have to be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept her opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingstone reached more when they had the ball.
After only two minutes, they were supposed to achieve a goal when Mengas led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long drive from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot by the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game was more hopeful than convincing in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of clashing with Steven Lawless, he should have been punished, but Judge Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian complaints to apply.
The Rangers only got two goal shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tough shot by Oviedo Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's match in the 34th minute may not have corresponded to the game, it is not to deny that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not bypass a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard was in mid-term and replaced Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediately effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingstone continued to play just the game they are playing, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the last phase, but McGregor kept up and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty for a crowd of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
Since then, the violin counter has become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with apparently unusual Cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Really, I hear a crack!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system to 'see' dehydrated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and destroy degenerated cells.
The vaccine contributes to the immune system during treatment to detect degenerated cells.
The method takes from a patient immune cells that are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can see a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that gives birth to the immune system has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes out a patient’s immune cells, which are changed in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the USA in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "produces the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken from immune cells and taught them to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of leukemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump-Tirade and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was credited with Saturday Night Live at the studio after he had widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to become a presidential candidate by 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a chimp-canonade against the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“I am asked so often by the whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He is racist.’
So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford about Brett Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate's judicial committee.
Although the recording of West's Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock in social media.
It's not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
They have said that ‘don’t go out with the cap’.
You harassed me!
And then they say I found myself in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he's going to "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His remarks triggered at least two outbursts from the audience, and SNL employees were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said to the magazine, "It was dead still in the studio."
West had been obliged as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West, many confused with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKE, THAT YOU REPRESENTED THE MESSE."
However, the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just him himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes himself a harmful ideology to my community and gives of himself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us," she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and now was "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the deceased music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Knowledge As Prince" (The previously known as Prince).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kitting attacked toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs of violence by medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often having to feel strong in order to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married 31 Rose Leslie, also a member of "Game of Thrones", admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
"I personally think the question is very important today, what has gone wrong with masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught growing men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embodies this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change that?
For with the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" in the next summer. He had "suitable of battlefields and horses".
From November Harington will be seen in a new edition by Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that for him the best thing about "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife at this show, so I have received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the award-winning Ygritte Fantasy series with Emmys, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of the new cases through sex trafficking.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, reported Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS rose by 100,000 in China year-on-year.
The HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is expected to be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection in sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data of the GOP senators passed through, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Maxine Waters, Member of the U.S. House of Representatives, argues on Saturday that a member of their staff has published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Members' Wikipedia pages.
Democracies from Los Angeles believed that the claims of "ultra rights-oriented" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"The lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government quarter.
The publication took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ explanation quickly triggered criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press spokesman of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," said Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
You must not question the applicant's motives.
They must be calm and let go."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having acted too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who joined the mid-term elections to replace water, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters stated in her statement that her office informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are brought to account for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff."
Critique of "Johnny English – You live only three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film. This also seems to be the case for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion which made it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now quite right" relived.
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obviously we are complaining about the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of Johnny English, cutting griffon and incompetent, has been extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking areas.
Of course, he is again the knock-on secret agent, who is bizarrely cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed from something Clouseau, a prize of Mr. Bean and a slap on this guy, who at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London made a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of Victory".
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind abandoned travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly hung on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is emerging, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the 'serious' film series such as '007' and 'Mission Impossible' now offer self-confidently comedian elements.
The humor seems to focus more on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy miscarriage is not as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gigs in the role of Bean.
The eternally current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and unveiled the identities of all British agents in operation, much to the detriment of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure that is already facing the complete collapse due to her political in popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi Teresa may character, but the script does not give much of what she can work with
Their intelligence consultants inform them that all active spies were decommissioned and therefore they have to take someone out of retirement.
This includes the Tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic establishment, but gives unofficial teaching in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few Gags because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commandant, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who in the secret service of your Majesty always make everything terrible wrong, are back in action. In doing so, they encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in danger from a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of grotesque Spåße: as waitress dressed, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they care for chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the subject is already dealt with in detail on the children's television.
It's a rather moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can't the British film industry, Rowan Atkinson, play a role that will really satisfy its talent?"
Labour argues to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week, but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that foresees that the British are working four days a week, but are paid for five days.
According to reports, corporate leaders want to pass on to employees the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off.
This would have made the employees a three-day weekend, but would still have received the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is 'fits'.
The transition to a four-day week was supported by Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the advantages of the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a directive review is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort which is consistent with the party's approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and with the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the launch of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not generally supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "At a four-day week it is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
In the Labour Conference last week, shadow Chancellor John McDonnell put forward his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public utilities.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, as a Labour government could make deductions because of alleged misbehaviour.
He also confirmed the appropriate plans to appoint employees in the boards of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds in order to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation in the Kavanaugh case might change their mind
The FBI investigation into the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge of the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 minute correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could do something to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I told you in the trial that I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and incomprehensible."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
"My opinion is on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs to be bombed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett disputed this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all who called them could not confirm it."
It's been 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
On this Saturday in New York, the Global Citizens Festival takes place, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup on stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizens Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, in order not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. In the context of this project, an international interest group is trying to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea to put a cool free concert in view, a sensible way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think by signing an online petition or sending a tweet to change something?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters and has been able to achieve various goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been paid out or recruited by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global Citizenship like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the The Power of Nutrition project, which is aimed at reaching 5 million women and children and providing food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They answered: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, as we are both stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year’s event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington’s examination, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the U.S. Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, announced.
Zince claimed that Russia’s use in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working at the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new markets in the field of energy, as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to do this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he announced.
Zinke turned to the participants in the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that is seen as the "voice of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia with the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the 'unappropriate' Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, became the 'prisoner' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion US dollars, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Association of Industry (BDI), has asked the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," says the Executive Board of the BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts.
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town-hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren is planning to 'examine' a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is turning this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren has not taken any note of it.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that it should compete for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the Senator should not compete.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are against it.
Among the other names of prominent democrats, which are eligible for a possible candidacy in 2020, are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make official decisions by January.
Sarah Palin comments on the Donald Trump rally on post-traumatic stress disorder under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday evening.
"What my son is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "Elephant in Space" and said about her son and other veterans of war that they came back changed, that they came back from being broken, that they came back and asked if there was any respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support a remedy for the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a remedy to the new US policy that refuses victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District submitted a court hearing in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker in questioning politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace-to-Sessions-Clage, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against the Federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
She announced that her partner "and his violent sons-in-laws" abused them, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people put an application for asylum in the United States, as nations who have to contend with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeal of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Columbia, stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "despite decades of legislation at the state, state and international level".
"The Bundesgesetz requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle", was stated in the case-law.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies which immigrants refuse to enter the country have an adverse impact on the economy in the US, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workers.
In June, Federal Secretary General Jeff Sessions ordered immigrants' judges to stop offering asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
"Asyl exists for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or for fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said Sessions in its announcement of 11 June.
It was never the plan to solve all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people have to deal with every day in the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation has become worse and worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance with dead arrives.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their fallen property and wealth and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5, were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who joined vertebrates and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the continuing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the severe earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was stuck under the wall," he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason why I stayed in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my kid.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador to the tyranny sued China with "propaganda ads"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused the state capital of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
USA Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the US Congress elections on November 6th, a charge that China contests.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to interfere in the U.S. elections correspond to the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extensive trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, who exported agricultural products to China to a large extent, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, says Branstad in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now double this tyranny by placing propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of freedom of expression and the independent press proven in America by switching on paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," said Branstad.
"In contrast, in Beijing you will find only a limited number of contradictions on the newspapers and will not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans pamper voters in front of the interim elections with the Kavanaugh debacle, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations for sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could be caused by women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they continue with a vote.
"One cannot reverse such things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation was sufficient to satisfy angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the corridor of the Senate called "November is coming!", when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to hold the nomination of Kavanaughs and that, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer of the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with voters in the suburbs and with younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her accusations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court, observers argued that counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans carried forward the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the board, about the final vote or about the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the channel of communication.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with whom they should believe on account of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly greater share on the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% claimed that they believe that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied to his statement, while 30% stated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an oath last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had unveiled his genitalia when they were at a party during their study in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid from Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to select where their data is stored and who gets access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We need to get active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The application uses the technology of Solid so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can only decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal enhancement and development of data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding skills to ensure that solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform purchased by IBM will be used.
With the start of this week, technology developers worldwide will be able to create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change will be made, in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a major participant in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award because of his engagement in the attack on Bellenglice and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the granddaughters, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and violent fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before firing a field gun in the single line and eliminating three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never do, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero will be visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to see Bellator 206, instead there was Pepa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig could be seen.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the cartoon character as a sort of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, this content is classified as non-youthless, so that it had to be changed to a child broadcast at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in Marketing and Communications at Bellator when he was asked to be transferred.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO at Bellator, Scott Coker, announced that the company will process the schedule to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think the problem could already be solved during the repeat game," he said.
“But it is 6 o’clock in the morning on a Sunday with the spectators in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay on it.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It was quite messed up and it wasn't always everything nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disorder.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise, it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual. And we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels about sexuality 'down'
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realised at the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke on the subject of gay rights to encourage others.
He also thought, since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses for several months due to illness.
In the first broadcast of Laverne, he said that earlier compared to others he considered himself inferior, since love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: "To this day is the feeling of being inferior to others and of being different from others, reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success."
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The dual bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this issue because he could fortunately live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He means that if you had to go through so much as a child and a youth – he was the first to participate in the Olympic Games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, he'd have turned everything around gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be at the front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he is not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I only knew it had always been my dream to dive in front of a local audience at Olympic games – that was madness," he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in advance of the Olympic Games and still cared for goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday at the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the reserve bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that are straining him.
Even at the height of his career, 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not disheartening enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments in the ninth game on Sunday to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points back at the 12 single games put a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk confidently expressed himself to Mickelson and could not add much.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a slap on his back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world-famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had introduced myself more, but that's how it went now and that's what we expected.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup run that never entirely matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can score 18 wins, had to put 20 defeats in and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to do a couple of little girls, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week. It was fun watching them.
He is a truly interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can soon be over with the advance
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
In 1997 the Dane debuted in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only just crossed the finish line and went in the lead with the lowest possible lead and won a victory of 1411⁄2–1311⁄2.
"The idea remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was just a short shot," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after he had seen the victory 5–3 of Class 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10–6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow's about to start.
Get the fuck out of here and do the right thing.
The whole thing's not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said it, I'm concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're totally aware of what's opposite: the best players in the world."
Frightened by the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overshadow it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow's individual performances are in the foreground and that's a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're out there alone, then you're tested up to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ensure that his players cut off individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great turnarounds on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's 'wonder of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
If the momentum moves in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of picking up a counterpoint, he has to play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, because I believe it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigates of the German Navy should have been deployed in 2014 in order to replace warships from the Cold War in the years to come. However, according to local media, they will only be delivered at the earliest next year due to faulty systems and rapid growing costs.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the brand new frigates of the Bath-Württemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the time when a military speaker was calling for.
The ship should have been in service already in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems after delivery had been plagued.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and marine missiles as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delays may lead to the erance of the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as a sea force, at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
Last year, Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by the accident, got into the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned to Hamburg by the Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
There was little known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors" which the new ship would have made unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also become known that the ship is much too difficult, which results in a loss of performance and prevents the marine from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, have become a problem.
It seems that the cost increased to a breathtaking 3.1 billion €, compared to the initially planned 2.2 billion €.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the sea power of Germany is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the German Bundestag's weather commissioner, confirmed that the Navy "is leaving the ships in use".
Bartels said that the problem with time got bigger, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown langohr and water bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In the case of a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and what species does what.
Next, a map and a report of the habitat are created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine and demonstrate the benefits of life management measures such as the creation of meadows and how forest areas for bats and other related species can be obtained.
The stocks of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of the habitat.
Windwheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echoing to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across Scotland, takes the topic of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Governor David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
"Here in Threeave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we don't yet know about bats, so here and at other goods we carry out these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish civil servant of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still need to learn a lot about bats and many of our species we don't know how it is about their populations."
Ronaldo denounces rape charges, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges against him as "fake news" and said that people want to be "famous" by the use of his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine The mirror that published the accusations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her 375,000 dollars to buy her silence to the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profil themselves through the use of my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror because of the accusations they referred to as 'inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for "moral damage at a height equal to the severity of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident should have occurred in 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped them allegedly as a result of documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent" and "one percent".
In the documents it is claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it was agreeable.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she had "fear before retribution" and was concerned to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to break up the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he made a 100 million euro deal to Italian giant juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘eternally regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "eternally regret" if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leader in cars, says Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He went on to say that it was 'disquieting' that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production in the Burnaston plant at Derby's should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer indicated that the influence of delays at the border could lead to job losses in a no-deal fraction.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis product lines were produced last year, produced almost 150,000 vehicles, 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our factory at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also caused fears of a tough EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini-works in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing plant is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could be interrupted at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock holding at the factory in Derbyshire that would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I said will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 broadcast Today 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite-Vereinschaft, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs never come back again once they're gone.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to the White House's statements
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "removed another week", while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has been overseeing the work of special agent Robert Mueller, who is investigating the electoral interferences by Russia, connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as possible judicial disability by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as the president's resignation with the help of the 25th constitutional addition.
Rosenstein denounced the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, announced.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, thus further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press officer Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question about meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going ahead with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences does not lie in an aversion to the TV reporter's "effecthackery", but admitted: "But I would not deny that they are doing efficiency harassment."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
The President makes more question-and-answer rounds than any President before him," she explained, without any precise evidence: 'we have looked at these figures'.
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it will be far better than I am.
We try to do this often, and you have seen that we have done so many times in the last few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when, before assembled reporters, he made a run-out and sometimes bizarre appearance.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns about EU workers of Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressing people from the EU abroad who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, the disembarkation negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the UK Government has also reinforced the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Ladies and gentlemen from all over the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subjected to an emergency operation following a head injury which he committed on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the chief trainer of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before laying on a load and being transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the OP in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the type or extent of the injury yet" were known and Tennessee State tried to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called red shirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after he switched from Illinois.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, thus increasing his total in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to levy a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom in the future.
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamping fee will concern all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional income being paid to homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success with young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and to take top earners into view.
The increase in the excise duty will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge levied in addition to the current stamping tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on secondary residences and leased residential properties could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects through the step with additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom, thus raising prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to take a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, became 'ghost cities' due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke out for a reduction in the stamp tax in order to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's "inhabitation shame."
The opposition leader Corbyn announced a striking number of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a lease price commitment to the prohibition of rooms without a valid reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister of the restoration of the British dream, according to which life from generation to generation should become better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that it is his “largest goal” to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of raising the club from the North-East of England's new life, which is just on the third place in the League One and the three points to the top are missing.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I made it to the bank and that was it," said Ross of the show Sports Sound of BBC Scotland.
“But I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden as a child with my father and this is something that always draws me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in association management."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's role as manager include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former chief of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to step into the steps of such established names at such a club after he had previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at my moment by whether I can take the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities of this club, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I'd only assess my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can show a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the delegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real step forward," he recalls when he took responsibility for Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny as I did not look bad, could live well and some very pleasant high-phases experienced.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my entire life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturday at 17:30, according to a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenue of Britain's crumbling pubs an upturn, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July. However, according to statistics, restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the corporate consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “The longer than expected participation of Pubs in the World Football Championship, the higher the number of other sunshine and England, meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, where Pubs recorded sales increases of 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant hit it even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a surface-adjusted turnover development that increased more than it sank at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM leisure and catering industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies focused on food and it remains to be seen whether the temperate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breathing break."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Case Peach Tracker for the public, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that it hides from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools has identified an increase in so-called 'fake insta' pages.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students claimed to own a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at advanced schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "fake Insta" accounts, a tendency to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students reported having a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but also own private accounts.
One mother, who was on the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager, the other called upon me to " rape."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half adding to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "a voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of Scottish Athletics Association Scottish Athletics at its annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports professionals to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Scottish, UK and World athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as an athlete's voice and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, named his own four Olympic gold medals in total and now often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary blood flow disturbance.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me whether or how far I will heal.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers with cows provides excitement in the net
A producer of milk pumps caused excitement in the net with an advertising clip in which silent mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
The manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie publishes a non-extremely meant music video to emphasize the freedom that gives the pump sucking mothers to introduce the first low-noise milk pump around the world.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song containing lines like: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a cock" or "if you haven't noticed it, these are not udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has caused a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among the spectators, many of whom say that the "frights" of the dairy industry are harmless.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they have to get pregnant and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away from them within a few days after birth," it was said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Incredible traumatic for mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers to keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'such a non-realistic advertising'.
Others defended the advertisement and one woman admitted that you found the song "urcomian".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would've bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like "cheese".
This is no advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced in their bras with the discrete pumps.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate how to feel like dairy cows.
However, the pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it earned a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the related challenges and at the same time to introduce in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski published a double mother on the Catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively similar, among other things, since intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of them were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even the target of expulsion when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential managers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior customs official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no prior entries in the criminal record.
"Only 80 per cent of those who are either self-employed or a member of a household of a caretaker are illegally resident in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we will continue to persecute these people," Albence explained.
In order to deal with the cases of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that, according to employees of accommodation for some children, require them to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days of the arrest, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video and not personally to come before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decision, the person is quickly postponed.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the staff members of the accommodation, as well as reports that in the last month the system has become known that they are being frightened and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are heightened in a larger institution such as Tornillo, as signs that a child has problems are overlooked due to the size of it.
They also explained that traumas, which many of the children already suffer, could strengthen if they were taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or sufficient time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish “occupational troops” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war is now in the country in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces are being treated illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and are being treated accordingly.
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus 'will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed' by both groups of terror and 'youth illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria, mainly both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, training and consulting.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moulem stated that the conditions for their return were met and he accused 'some Western countries' of spreading 'irrational fears' which prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable return home," he said.
"They're actually politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold Idlib represents the possibility of pre-empting political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, allied with Al-Qaeda, will be implemented.
UN representatives Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem mentioned the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the 'recasting of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, an official collection or a scandal terminate his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that it was enough for the spectators.
Since 2014, the entry rates at the best transmission time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" introduced the switching rates with being 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that attracts people magically, as it is something we do not understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designated Survivor" on the ABC TV station, about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh’,” said Scovell.
The chaos is worth having fun.
Of course, the stories from Washington, as opposed to everything on television, can determine the future of the decision on the principle of abortion Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
The switch-off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also going to be an informed citizen if one becomes aware that he has already looked at six hours of an expert round which, above Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post, a "skinning piece rich in self-examination") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's exhilarating description of Trump's, uh, anatomy discussed.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he does can be felt like a reality show he performs every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily acts (a fight with the football league NFL break from fence, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a episode, or you won't come with you anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He simply could not get rid of the screen, not if Judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to make a statement before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy missions at the time and the people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was some kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Donations flowed the tightest races to sit in the congress in the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th constituency of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the new boundaries of the constituency, which led to the fact that two officials are in the race around the same seat.
The newly signed suburban district in Pittsburg is allowing the Democrats Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were violated and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a striking exchange of funding between the parties' major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a highly respected special election in March around the state's 18th district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won it with 20 percentage points ahead.
Polit experts are giving the Democrats an easy lead.
The US examined the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Valerio in June 2017, and owned a Panama hotel as a partner to throw out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of 'the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan', says Heather Nauert, Minister of State spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was there considered penalties, which in 2017 received an estimated 140 million dollars in American aid, including for drug controls, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now appointed as spokesman at the conference set up in mid-October, in order to give a sign of the importance of the government of the Assembly, according to diplomatic statements.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and to the Dominican Republic without any new news or criminal measures from Washington.
A government spokesman of John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by special agent Robert Mueller on Trump's possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller also reportedly investigates whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the congress changes, Trump would see himself confronted with an organ that forces him to account, exactly at the time when he passes by to step again before the voters; and possibly before a jury of jury members.
That is a lot of 'why' and I don't want to say that Donald Trump's case, or his European counterpart's, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will influence how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only made him resist and had supported the Czechoslovakian Slovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump leaves Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein reported in devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated that he was unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denounces the depiction of the New York Times.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation in office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we'll have a long winter ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?"

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic about the game against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put her in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went to the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could still win at the end, but overall, an undecided result was probably fair.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a tough game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
The fear of old age leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the study of Nationwide reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the National Life Insurance Team.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-creating life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn off legal disputes at the last minute.
Apply a precautionary measure so that you order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You select a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your invoices are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shootings that took place at about 02:30 British times as a 'wild act'.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Because of the failed communication systems, relief workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary as the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district extending over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
In 2017, 299,200 people lived in the government district, an administrative unit below the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue in the Central Sulawesi economy, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesia Civil Protection Authority, Palu and Donggala have been several victims of earthquakes and tsunamis over the last 100 years.
In 1938 over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly haunted by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a strength of 7.6 hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters altitude, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from a falling building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok popular with tourists and claimed more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Governor Alaskas and former candidate for the vice-president's office, was arrested due to accusations of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the obstruction of the announcement of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a friend when he wanted to get the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a bail of 500 dollars has been collected.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plea with "Not guilty, certainly" the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A violations of order, which can be punished with up to one year of imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B breach of order, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of obstructing the announcement of a crime and of possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend ordered him to beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after returning her son's behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in Palu City when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutorship calls for rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, during which in October he raced on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims and added "consciously" serious body injuries, that is to say, in the declaration of intent for the claim of the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death according to the court document.
On 22 points following the attack, a federal investigating court sued Saipov, which included eight charges of the murder against the background of the organised crime normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for 'fundamental planning and intent', according to the prosecutors who described the way Saipov performed the act as 'disgusting, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habiballaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses," explained.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was executed in New York in a federal offense, in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were accused of committing spying for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, gave birth in the days and months after the attack of lack of regret, according to court records.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, so the police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also demanded, according to police records, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, stated that she was “of course disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of a debt confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal will only prolong the trauma suffered by all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously requested the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative MEP calls on NIGL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has sworn to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest campaign at the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip stated that politicians must 'feel the pressure' of Euroskeptics, while a Member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should conduct the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative porter Peter Bone explained to the protester in Birmingham that if Farage Brexit was a minister, the United Kingdom would be “ready outside. ”
The challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of its deeply disfellowshiped parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are in favour of a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems in keeping her Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allys insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and therefore force Euroskeptics and the oppositionary Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained at the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “Chequers belong to the garbage”.
He suggested that Farage should have been named a peer and that he should have been entrusted with the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible for it, we'd already be outside," he said.
Wellingborough’s deputy added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not fought in world wars to be subdued.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
Brexit supporter of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and said to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who are actually going through the streets and making sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister keeps her jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’, they should be in the process of cheating on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
‘They’re trying to deceive Brexit, and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘that’s not how you get away from it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which helped us to win the referendum and will never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit Group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party that was launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
It just doesn’t give good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ the presidential candidate’
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the elections in November, she would "examine the presidential candidate".
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusett on Saturday.
Warren, a distinguished critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the Senate's re-election against the Republican MPs in the parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump's election campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been their 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's entry into office.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to "go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims from Friday in the case of the deadly shots.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury at his head and died as a result of this injury," says the sports media portal 247sports of police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and owning a weapon and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Big Prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title after his team has given him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying on Saturday in front of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the stand orders of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he was defending Hamilton when he invited him to attack his teammates in the first two rounds.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit the traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later went into the box and landed behind Vettel, but after a short wheel-and-wheel manoeuvre, Hamilton overcame him, where the Ferrari pilot refused to release the inside, with the risk of having two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the rear squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then the fastest for most of the race as he held on to his tires to end quickly and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went in the 44th round into the box and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri made an excellent performance all weekend, and as a real gentleman did when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of himself during a election campaign on Saturday about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter not be passed on to the press to the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement to the Senate's Justice Committee did not directly address it, but commented that the Senate's proceedings show that people are "noble, evil and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is to see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the Leaks and you say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the Leak?
Thinking about your answer... Published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was charged with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein, according to the committee's report from The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter a secret, and I gave her permission to keep it secret."
Your Dementi did not seem to arrive at the president’s office, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, claimed that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power with all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to gain power and control," said the President Mediaite.

Air traffic controllers died after he made sure that hundreds of people escaped from the earthquake on a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death in order to launch a plane with hundreds of people on board safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthony Gäferan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily weakened control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousand. The Civil Protection Authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson.
Waves with up to 6 meters of height have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, explaining in a speech to the military in the country: “I ask you to work all day and night to do all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports of a missing aircraft crash in lagoon
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports of a missing person who initially claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that they cannot say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline indicated working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital, but they were in a stable state.
The cause and exact outcome of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed shortly before the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying over the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very flat.
"That's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane by hip-deep water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the improvement of an installation site were rushing with an inflatable boat to help people get to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 people died in crashes from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges closed their evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their night of death using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period when he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the Witness stand on Saturday and said that he was not in the city the day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's Pick-Up that night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated to have known Chambers two weeks at their time of death.
But cell phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis got rid of their messages, calls and contact information from his cell phone some time after Chamber's death.
"He has cut them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense is expected to begin their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure will then proceed on that day before the jury.

Another black one?!
New York nanny sued couple for a release for "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother, in which she complained that she was still "black".
The couple struggled to be racist and compared the legal dispute with a 'torn'.
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her concern when she found out that the new mother of the day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEINE, SOMETHING A SCHWARZE", Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Twice.
After recognising her Fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman Maurice, who was “indignantly touched” and claimed that the open-minded African-American mother of the day had done bad work and had expected a Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and asserts a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars per day that she should last for over six months, the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she explained on Friday, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism accusations and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice after they had offended them could no longer trust.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with a 'suffering' and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and is 'in a difficult situation'.
“You want to be interested in such a person?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in the public domain and accused of social media, where they were criticized for their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "bittersweet".
She explained that your father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not brag," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that makes something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that doctors gave her little chance," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs you gave the doctors to hold their heart on to the pump slowly rang off and left their body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to rip myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who got nothing of what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives through a suicide strive to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consultants.
David's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he began suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was expecting a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room."
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, "I'm always afraid that might have a consequence."
Davis designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even when it’s a friend.
Don't shut up: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom of the story. When the kids unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that had to go through: “It rips a huge hole into the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the Schwebe while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that he asked about, that is, a time-limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little insight," Flake said on Saturday. He feared that the Committee would "break apart" in the party political stagnation.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The interim elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, then they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone listener to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to decide in equal terms and to confirm him before the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean crossings “sinks” under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-sug, who refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 runners were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pjöngyung did not make a public statement on this matter.
The vast majority of the northern crossings are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the overflowers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in a state of war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two heads of state met in Pjöngyang to talk about the set-up of democratic negotiations.
This was due to the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work on a democratic Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the US, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm one-sidedly first," says Mi Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office of the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at Nancy Pelosi called Judge Candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was characteristically unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh objected emotionally to all the accusations that he had abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost shouted and was about to burst into tears when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated murder of the call", organized by Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as they showed that he was biased towards democrats.
"I believe that he has declared himself unfit with these statements and the way in which he went about the Clintons and the Democrats," she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to dissuade Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial post," Pelosi says.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi went on to say that, as a democracy, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the removal principle decision Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, biased person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Oh, this isn't wonderful'," says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of boiling anger and she can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was manager somewhere and said that she was also crying when she became angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and begins to cry, she says to the person she said, “They may think that it’s sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found that brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is of a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of unspeakable anger and was dragged into a staircase by an elderly woman, an undercooled manager who was always a little afraid of me.
"Never let them see that you're crying," she told me.
"You don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with them, as they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on board a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder considered that there is no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidate itself.
"That wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves”.
As the election campaign had already progressed, it was in the back of funding and it was sworn not to compete if it was not to come together for $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, supported their campaign only with $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so grateful to her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the creation of funds and the direct addressing of the voters instead of the delegates so difficult, as well as the anger about sexism, so overwhelmed that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“One could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would probably write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning signal at the beginning of the year when he imposed fines on important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the USA.
Beijing struck back in the same way every time and recently raised fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has sworn to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
Moving Washington in the way would mean giving up. However, a public squandering over the US would be far too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays out its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses herself on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria would be 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister.
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war of over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the circumstances in the country improve.
"Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure," he said.
The government is building up the areas destroyed by terrorists to reverse normality.
All the conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept any conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, sank off the 16th Railway (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the Europe Team, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all times with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to pass the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the single encounters.
I'm so proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I've been watching on TV since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time, who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had all weekend problems to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have made high-calibre performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We'll regroup, I'll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
