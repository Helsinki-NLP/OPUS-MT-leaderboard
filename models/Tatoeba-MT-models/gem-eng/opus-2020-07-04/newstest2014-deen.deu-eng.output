Credit: even more security for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres away from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 footfall at the village parking lot was launched in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or citizenship?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The town hall was installed at that time because it secures the school trail," Eckert explained yesterday.
The traffic lights secure both cyclists as well as bus passengers and the mountain dwellers.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›grub‹.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian appearance, another traffic lights had to come to their safety," says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold from Offenburg County Council.
"According to current measurements, the municipality of Gutach is around 12,000 vehicles per day at B 33, of which about 10 percent are heavy goods vehicles", says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp would be more than necessary: "Safety is just going to happen here," Arnold says.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, and a roundabout was also considered, but because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything has been tested before during the selection of the traffic lights: "With an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks loaded, we have figured out whether these vehicles can go out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the traffic lights".
The approximately 15 000 Euro expensive traffic light plant itself is the "modernest what is currently on the market", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that glow so powerful that the lights of the motorists can be seen well, for example, even in the setting sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian pushes the traffic position, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people are to cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road", Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver here had to think as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, a high-class vehicle rushed through - with glowing red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing about his childhood and youth.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the slope to brutal violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often described the poet of Carinthia.
The Büchner prizewinner is known mainly as a prosawriter, theatre lyrics are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibgeigen" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family beleaguered" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisition: a cracked sofa, on which the meaning is cobbled and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance overthinks the template with a wealth of directional incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic playing forms.
Especially the actresses come with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their head submerged under water, with their evening robbers plucked to the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodices, they stacked on dangerously high poles through the staging, either monologue loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
The text, however, hardly conveys itself in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs.
Only towards the end does the overturned performance come a bit to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed in each car's dashboard.
The devices that record each kilometer travelled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system of financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberates have joined environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use the small boxes to record the mileage travelled – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax records.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on an action, several states no longer wait.
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers can pay per driven mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"There's nothing we might only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the driven miles with all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, pays US Americans to the zap column, is ploughing.
But in America no more is done as much as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for a cent at high price.
"The fuel tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, a transport legislation expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most useful alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found with urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners focus on the system in developing strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state on climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also motivated by the idea of allowing drivers to pay after distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who in a report in 2011 had called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement.
Last year, the US Senate approved a 90 million dollar expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to spend many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently hires 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could follow each of their movements.
"Thinking about Big Brother and such things was a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at Nevada Transport Ministry.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look for affordable technology with which the state can capture the travelled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That, says Khan, would also make the public more calm.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
Originally, the company did not start to help states in taxing drivers.
Rather, it was its goal to take a foothold in an emerging car insurance market where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
However, the devices tested by it are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speeds and locations are not recorded," explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made huge mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a lump sum on the basis of the average miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that allows parking fees to be paid, insurance must be paid only for driving kilometers and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," it says in a planning document of the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area officials declared that Congress could simply solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team beats up wacker
The volunteer fire brigade passed its autumn main test despite lack of staff with bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen in his practice the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße.
It is said that a short circuit was created during the sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two carriers of breathing protection prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, the first person was able to find and lead into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line took place via an overfloor hydrant about 100 meters away.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also pointed out in the exercise what is to be achieved with little staff available.
In serious cases, support is provided through the Königsfeld daily deployment group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers came from tomorrow.
At the Hochschwarzwald Funding Centre, he and the managing school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parent council chairperson dealt with this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between funding centre, district gymnasium and vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised family kindness in the countryside.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase of caring for family members due to demographic change," said Wolf.
In addition, he pointed out that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies often retain their knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in south-west Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to improve public passenger transport.
"Stay stubborn and ensure that public transport improves," he explained at the address of the local politicians present.
Experienced with music an entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cakes and then a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly were hosted in the restroom.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in St. Josef's nursing home.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, were engaged with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone walls as the preliminary demarcation of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße before the renovation will be re-appointed on the refurbishment plan of the city of Bræunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for the stabilization and static relief of the natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years old.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bræunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further approach is to include the National Monument Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts who will then be put on the table to the municipal council for decision and further action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two lateral wings of the school built in 1912, the necessary restriction walls must be renovated and put on new under construction in due course.
The historic one-hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, needs renovation and has an arched approach to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is currently not infested.
A stand-safe wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use the schoolyard, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the school yard renovation was planned even in the years 2008/2009 but high unplanned spending resulted in a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has already been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the National Monument Office.
If specifications come from this side, the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monumentists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music are currently part of the Stuttgart Jazz site.
In this way Özdemir, who is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, among other things, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim Musikhochschule.
US-Green: Super-Tunnel Detected for Drug Smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the US, investigators discovered and silenced a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the tube between Tijuana and San Diego, more than 500 metres long, was equipped with electricity, rail slides and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana seized, and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the tunnel, the data have not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said the U.S. Attorney General Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where an end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turned to the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track was equipped so that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder takes 20 meters to the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was captured for the confiscated marijuana.
As officials said, all three are threatened by life-long deprivation as the highest penalty.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such tunnel construction.
Cocaine is usually smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "definition" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have since been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug charge in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one was Mexican, it was called.
You have to expect prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 will Geisinger Feast
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in more than eight weeks, the anniversary year is due.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in a documentary manner.
A document was produced in churches where both places are mentioned.
On 15 March there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this start-up event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time, in church houses.
During the anniversary, several events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in Kirchen-Hausen.
Church Houses will be held in July on a weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
At the end of this weekend there is also the church-house church festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written for the city on the occasion of the anniversary an order composition that is presented on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Society, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, 27th and 28th September.
A new chronicle will also be released on the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum.
"But not only is it to be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but it is to be a printed work on today's geisingen, which consists of geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the singing of today celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 today's space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzünft Strohglonki starts on February 8th with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to May 4th.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this at the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses), which was then courtyard.
Thus, both communities are mentioned in the same document.
Due to the fact that this 1250-year-old is celebrating accordingly in 2014, the community reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes track facilities into the visor
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be built up in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils have decided.
Schiltach will have to take in 220,000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, safety of train crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest share railway and federal.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Griesshaber explained to the council the peculiarities of the Bah crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build an outbuilding in the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those transporting long-wood, could stand in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Größhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could expand the following road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street distribution: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the critics' mood to the point: "Do we have to take so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" was partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberles bridge because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, Haas argued that the route was a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed.
Since it should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated, as it is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am "Hirschen" train crossing could also lead to an important traffic impact for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have the costs of the planned road widening investigated.
Despite this, the restructuring of the train crossing was generally agreed with the requirement that the necessary supporting walls be built in such a way that the city could expand the following road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the conversion of the trautwein railway crossing into the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem that affects access to the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" (Geroltzhäuser Weg).
The administration had commissioned the railway conversion plans to be investigated by the Breinlinger engineering office, because it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Groltzhäuser road would be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that road inclinations could lead to longer vehicles being located.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road builder.
Therefore, the conversion could lead to disputes of liability.
Since both the logging and turning off worked in the current state of expansion, haas was not to be agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing, arguing.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition would be much lower than that of the other crossings, because the centre is directly adjacent to the centre stop, where a good visual link exists.
Even trains from the main station would have to be suspended at this point to the point where no collision would threaten.
The majority of these railways were refused approval, as the city of Ziltach had to "welcome" the problem of rolling vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The board considers it unproblematic to see the reconstructions at the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" crossings, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - European space agency experts now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them lives, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or, after earthy planets, perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that are raised by the European space agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance research.
The budget for such "L missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September in Paris, the elite of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were in the debate, five of them now came into the narrower election.
Numerous bodies review the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been asked by the Esa, on which the missions of the programme "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007 will find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A big infrared telescope in the pan could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To answer this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is due to start in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems are studied more closely in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be biological activity indicators.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should in the end provide an indication of what conditions exist for the development of life.
An important factor is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be exemplified.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa foresees the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic laws of the universe?
The Universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus investigate whether the laws of nature that we know there are still valid.
Perhaps there are also variations that the physicists could point the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what did it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter, consisting of stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there is Dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and Dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang, nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already authorised an M mission, the launch of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of being granted as an L-Mission, a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
These include physicists understanding changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission foresees a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to installations on earth, he could also show gravitational waves that were created at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights about the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals compete for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
There are already a number of proposals on the transport of samples from Mars, on the investigation of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as on solar physics.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag, if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander give no answers about their activities.
On Thursday, German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia, where this asylum received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a betrayal of fidelity and tries to criminalize political opinion with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the US government to drop the charge against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Regarding time, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are under pressure from the claims that NSA has heard the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, said that the opportunity should be given to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, 'without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US'.
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele stated that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says he's in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he's "safe" there, according to the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
However, it was affected by the global reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the disclosures about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a benefit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand baggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even though in the announcement on Wednesday it was to be read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that when the fee was paid in advance, it was calculated 25 US dollars, and 100 US dollars for travelers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Airlines started in 2008 to charge fees for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore put as much as possible into hand luggage, resulting in the luggage compartments being frequently overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that with the new fee, it's not really about making money.
It is about the most trusted customers of Frontier, who would clearly have expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a luggage item free of charge on the frontier's flight path, but the next person may need to pay 100 dollars for a comparable luggage item.
O'Malley stated that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedure would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the airport.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier only enters into force in summer, an exact date does not yet exist.
Passengers often use baggage and other charges, but airlines are happy to take advantage of them.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far left the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first hand baggage fee and then followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitored the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand luggage fee would bring in Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a management position at Midwest Airlines, was recently flown with spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him on the flight path if passengers faced the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smoothly experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see dental and hands-on discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like a braid."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and coffee would be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways had recently tried to demand money for soft drinks, but this regressed seven months later after passengers had complained and no other big company had succeeded.
Frontiers' step to raise charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase rather than via an online travel agency.
Frontier has, however, gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half as many miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight route.
Therefore, a third-party flight with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as is stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get into control of Frontier's finances in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Comes From the Bible
About 40 women visited the last breakfast of this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "Languages From the Bible" and "Languages From the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, entered the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Languages contain wisdom of life, rules or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the appropriate Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called the sayings such as: The eye of wood, like the eye of the eyes falling, throw an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
On several occasions, the speaker also advised his listeners about what saying it was.
The speech from the Middle Ages was accepted by the church council of Christel Dehner: all good things are three, blue, snuff out something.
She explained the significance and origin of the speech she called "bridge into the past".
Finally, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round also mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched today at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants.
"New is that the six-month courses end with closures," said Carmen Wiechert of the work agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are varied: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be getting trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA states that an "internal error" and not hacker are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on late Friday that an error has paralysed their public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unable to reach it for several hours tonight as an internal error occurred during a planned update," explained the spy agency in an email message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evenings, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is not possible for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way compromised".
Secret information is not in danger, according to the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was No Such Agency (No Such Authority), is now in the bright light of the public and looks forward to the revelations of its extensive surveillance program in domestic and foreign countries, which have become known in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service sparked initial speculations over the fact that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of people without a job in October is slightly reduced by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Head of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have responded to attitudes so far.
One reason for this is, according to field builder: "We have few skilled workers in crafts, health care and old-age care".
Since September, seasonally speaking, there have also been vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Winning losses at Bombardier after a decrease in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent reduction in net profits on Thursday after he had been under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
So far, only three more take-offs followed on the fly of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of outperform to 'sector performance' with a view to a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"We were expected to expect lower delivery rates for aircraft as far as possible, but we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate so far, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and pledges of 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman of the Executive Board, is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the start of the commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not remain on the ground any longer than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, during the aircraft’s standing time, ground tests and software updates had been set.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to make a first flight and then to follow a review period, whatever we have done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, it was called by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether 12 months after the Jungfernflug the first customer can operate an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it reviewed the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier's internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share from 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share remain at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reports that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order portfolio in the aerospace sector amounted to 32.9 billion dollars on 30 September and was therefore unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were disappointing within the framework of our requirements, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment rose by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order base in the transport division was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was thus slightly increased compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to corporate governance, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock remained at 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google Financial Manager Patrick Pichette will switch to the Management Board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at the LAX Airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management reported on the short notice service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several injured people.
US President Barack Obama was kept informed of the situation, said the White House spokesman, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls as reported by several media.
A traveler told CNN that many people had been looking for protection in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and cried children.
Among the waiting people, panic had broken out, many had been hiding behind chairs for fear.
He's heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security department has suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "as in a film".
After that, he himself had been taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen near a safety control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television images it was possible to see how many ambulances and police cars performed in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter published photos of a special deployment command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management reported on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, making up a long reverse, according to CNN.
Except for landings, it was said that air traffic had been temporarily stopped.
However, several flyers were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX Airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on sub-world size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its drug trade activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
In 2011, he was arrested in his home by the police guard Scarborough, who had been involved in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the attorney's office.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unlawful information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police during a large investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine in a series of house searches and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug dependence could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary.
He admitted cocaine possession at a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the law's trash.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough made regular calls to Ditta, who was at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, Ditta was known to be a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but he refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that their discussion was subject to "the secrecy of law".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
During the police interrogation he stated that he was running an office under his private address as well as at his workplace and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced in court that he had called on important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests, and informed them of what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal prosecutor should know better than everyone else that the law is not broken."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a lawyer because he has too much to deal with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but rather a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against police investigations, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore called into question his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out any misconduct and claimed: "If I was a corrupt lawyer who I am not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would immediately do so."
But after the hearing Superintendent Lee Halstead told the police in Lancashire: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared guilty of conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years of imprisonment for drug offenders.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as lawyer clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Song Crane of Dunningen will surround two services with Franz Schubert's "German Fair".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators delighted this spring, the Song Crane will enrich two religious services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary fair will be held at the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Singings to the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is represented in the framework of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikvereinn Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism softs sightful confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, there will be fundamental changes in the Haslach (SE) seal care unit.
There is only one council of parishes for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach bodies prepared for the changes.
There is nothing more to change the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism toward the new is hesitant but tending to be confident.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral care team reached.
On the basis of a presentation, Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, SE Haslach as a church community forms a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the so far six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of foundations in which the parish office is represented.
At least two elected members shall be represented from each parish, six parishes being formed on-site so-called community teams.
In the future, it will be their job to promote the local life.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide for accumulated assets to be retained in the parishes.
On the other hand, the liabilities go to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large-scale investments planned, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, investment was also made only in projects that could be managed by the parishes alone," relativised Haslach's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "Become one, stay five" and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The councils of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
Preparations will be put into practice in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
In the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seal care unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the current becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in contrast to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four Pfullendorfer families will have to pay up to 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEC levy from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
Each year in October, the four operators of the main electricity lines will redefine this situation.
These include the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can raise by means of a surcharge above the electricity price.
The municipal works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed in its forecasts a higher expense, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now, the actual figures would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number is closer to the 2 cents.
Spotlight on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What to do then - ride in red?
If a person concerned has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, waiting time should be "adequate" which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light is expected.
However, if you continue the ride despite red light, you must be aware that it is the full fault of an accident caused by it.
If you are patient for less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough to warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had permanently ignored the traffic lights and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The traffic light wasn't defective, but ran into green a little later.
A ban on driving was left to him because of the particular situation - but the fine did not.
Municipal Council is looking forward to a solid household
Whenever it comes to community council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As explained by Andrea Rothmund, the administrative budget was higher than planned at around 7.6 million euros.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As investments have been less than planned in the financial year 2012, the return on investment has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the financial statements.
He and the councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may seem paradoxical, but these very good figures could cost the citizens soon.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to dispense with high lifting rates in the past.
In turn, according to Gerster, subsidies have already been cut from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments are in the coming years for which we would like to receive grants," said Gerster.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story is almost twice as long as that of the Festival of Herbs, where he was honored with a celebration.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing association.
Even after 60 years of singing with the now more than beloved choir he is still having great fun.
Wermter was also a member of the committee for 28 years.
He received several awards for his engagement and association loyalty: Jörg Kohr, pastoral adviser on behalf of the Cecilia Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - as the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as a graved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in regular stages: with the MGV Betra, the Song Crane of Salzstetten, the singers' department Baisingen and the local music club, the full-maringers had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and vocal styles, which were attended by about 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lust, her brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter gave them a little dance to honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundesslied".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choir songs like "Jägerwerbungen" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The vocalist Salzstetten and his mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Beerlied" in local fillets, where the full-maringer music club offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a cassperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy during the afternoon.
Children's Dreams Become True
The kindergartens and daycare facilities in the Zollernalbkreis get post office these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sand box?
To participate in the action, all kindergartens, children's day care centres and children's scripts from the entire Zollernabkreis can be found.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with this with the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forests Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects from all submissions three wishes.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be to realize with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 Euro and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many diligent builders.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with support from the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered on the agreed day to kindergarten and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press indignant about controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may wonder: what does Parliament think about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this draft law and return it to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, by means of the new law, 'the media is taking an effective grip', whereas The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya, wrote that they had suffered 'a severe blow' and titled the draft as 'draconian'.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the commission of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the charge was withdrawn after a media phone call.
According to the new law, media houses can be occupied with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Schillingen and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "the majority of radio stations can be forced into bankruptcy by a single penalty".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on the description of Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they silenced the media, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
"No one will ever know it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation, who describes Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and we will return to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already drawn public troubles in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the reductions imposed by the National Compensation Commission and reintroduced their fragrant salaries of about 532,000 Schilling tax-free per month – they are among the highest worldwide.
Bad Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz, despite the cold weather and the rain, did not pay anything to the importance for the city and the football club.
A more pleasant holiday hour would have been a pleasure for everyone last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all of them had the foresight that came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This went on to musicians who framed the festival, as did some speakers.
Wet became therefore also the FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were given to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and members of the association who took part.
Especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable volunteering commitment was also appreciated by Mr Karl Rombach.
Other greetings spoke for the Urban Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were adding to the original lawn area so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first thoughts on how to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the real school at Lake Salinen was planned.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of a artificial grass sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros at the total cost of 560 000 euros.
The construction of the 68 x 108 metre artificial turf square took place on 4 June.
During the construction phase over three months, 3000 cubic meters of earth were mined, half of which were used for the construction of a Dirt bike track.
The Union and SPD continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it concerns direct democracy, the appointment of Members and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This could include, among other things, the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD would like to end the coercion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for a single one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on this Friday's agenda, the SPD supported its No to a car-mout demanded by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flat rate for multiple use and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat to road exodus, which was already major accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be abolished at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be the right summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the open-air platform Killesberg.
It was indeed a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorists badly injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old passenger from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was traveling around 21.15 o'clock with her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath.
When they wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, they oversaw the incoming 37-year-old car.
The driver's seat collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Locking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza drove out on the left lane of the two-track Reichenaustraße on Thursday night, around 8 p.m.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
The BMW of a 23-year-old constanzer came into conflict with this.
The VW pass of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
A total of around 15000 damage was created, the police reported.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it was said.
Vienna Airport provides passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
This will no longer be the case at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speaker's transmissions are lost - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport is following an international trend with regard to the cancellation of individual transactions.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, for example, have already waived the noisy calls.
Due to the removal of these passages - on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers a day - it should be more calm at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all the other information on changed flight flights or departure times is going a little down here," says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake truck pull with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn farm farm from 6th to 8th September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander Games will start at 1:30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swag on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines tree trunks, hooves and water buckets.
The tree trunk is long and weighs between 25 and 30 kilograms.
"It's not a big deal," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown down vertically, should be skipped once and then just come to bed.
This is assessed by most points.
This depends on the accuracy of the target when laying hoofs.
From eight meters distance, a pick is thrown.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants at the water reservoir over 50 metres.
Time and amount of water in a botch are measured at the end.
Each "Clan" or team may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prizes.
You can already be trained from 10 a.m.
A suitable dress is desired, for example, the runners can compete in the bulkhead rock.
But also Swabian costume is allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury will issue a few more bonus points.
You can log in until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been suggested on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the fans of the brass come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabohmische Blasmusmusik from Schemberg designed the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes emotional rollers and a rich big band sound.
The Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and Schwarzwurstbaron, will be here for some time among the cattle.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas Market and at the Narrenzunt.
On Sunday, the Musikverein entertains linens for the early kicking, starting at 2 p.m. the peasant chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" then let the party end.
The stop-reader party with DJ Ralf is already on the start on Friday.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman's market and the shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw-hoopburg, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The sponsors are the multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quarker set.
The Vegetarian Federation is also called the World Road Day on November 1.
On the occasion of the World Road Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, leaving yogurt replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oats, almond or rice milk could be used.
Turn-on plant cream replaces conventional whiskers.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a spoon of ground linseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
For example, a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water are used instead of egg.
But also 50 grams of Sojajogurt or Seidentofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York City
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald Gymnasium met the American capital New York.
After eight hours of flight, it was about to go to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the city’s heart, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
Here already there was a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening light is a special attraction.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The City does not Sleep" was decided the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, the second day could reach the Statue of Liberty with a ferry and be climbed on foot.
After that, the financial center was devoted to Wall Street at the 11th of September.
On the third day, students from the 373 metre high viewing platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
After that it went through the hectic driving of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the day-to-day school at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertusmesse is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a quite ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting hornblower group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on perforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, original French melodies.
The brass wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tugs musically.
The fair takes place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The new design shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is referred to as a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In case of the visit of the same-named café at the impact in the district city of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to be the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, with the beautiful name, the café has this very purpose: to make an actual stay not only imaginable, but always hand-made experience again and again.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at once.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café ambient looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team spoils the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail varieties.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the fancy café at the castle as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the launch, the friendly café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group", says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to address young students as well as seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Café-Lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressophan
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour party was more of a outdoor event - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Good, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that's why Daniel Büttner isn't a great fan of event-ends: "You can't even do it all right now."
And with an event I always talk to only those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to interfere as little as possible with the normal operation."
Should be called: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the outlet in Kleve.
The road, which increasingly develops into a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many climbers, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the Gastrom ropes and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinner
It was the 165th Stiftungsfest to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious association in the very sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the appropriate solemnity to make honors.
This time Rolf Wagener was pleased about the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also made some rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year's awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by Honorary Chairman Horst Pier-Ribert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
==References====External links==
A special thank-you addressed the board to the team of Vereswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again spelled out a menu of the extra-class and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club room.
"New singing voices are welcome to us at all times," Schlotmann says.
UN announces new poverty reduction targets
From now on, the United Nations is starting to develop a new set of objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting sustainable development goals, which will replace the Millennium Goals that expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to 'think beyond national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process with which universal, sustainable development goals should be agreed," he said.
"These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, there is still good mood in the handball authorities.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't even know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon will raise the index finger in advance.
Many players I have been training in the A-youth myself.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"It is also important to wait to see if there is still reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must increase in any case compared to the previous appearances.
Most of all, in the cover work and in the turnover game, it happened tremendously.
Even the exploitation of opportunities must definitely improve.
Therefore, I hope that during the short break my players have finally got their heads free.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to agree to peace calls during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she has exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's independence spot on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white government of Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in trying to destabilize the country's independent government.
According to the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country would return to an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional state of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to bring down concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a 'loser', who 'will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government'.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words of Renamo, giving up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
In contrast to FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that were fired by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown-up men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good in negotiation and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for electoral reforms, has already declared that they will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a offending movement to achieve concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamo's electoral succession has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the Presidency," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has taken unrest to attack police stations and vehicles on important North-South connections.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but is located in Beira, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied with restraint to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, the slowing progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "examples of life", says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too wild, too aggressive and too dirty in some cases to be taught in schools", so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of ancient works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are "excessively educational", children would "abstain completely" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "disgusting".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be subdued, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob acquired his retirement residence in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years in the "Freihof" became alive.
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely awkward scene.
From the arrival of the award of honor citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kratzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as spokesperson through the ten different scenes, explained contexts and overruns of time from the youth to the upcoming retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his children's heaven, into his freeyard.
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
He used the two-spans and "Schwarzzzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to translate into the sister's role and gave her tremendous life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played well-selected music between the individual playing scenes and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor, Heinz Winkler, was honoured to give honor to the honorary citizen, who, together with part of the council of the city, in representation of the former official Hettich.
Their expectation then made the three king singers, who caused Hansjakob to cry out: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own three king's days will be alive again".
With their song "O Jesslein", they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "out, out."
His criticism of the District Church had at that time expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about agricultural devastation, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the home earth, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it was called at the end of the scene.
Many applause and many praises were offered by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The opportunities for the league stay of the sporty downgraded Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there's a wild card procedure, then there's now a less competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not apply for a possible backyard.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said Ex-National player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We weren't dealing with the wild card process, so long as Düsseldorf doesn't know that it gets a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
By 23 May Dusseldorf Baskets will be able to submit further documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economic viability.
So far, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the license twice.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening Meal Church moves into the spotlight
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City's Culture and Tourism Office devotes the last of its public guided tours this year on Sunday, 27 October, the Evening Meal Church.
After the visit of the nuclear basement museum, the Haigerlocher is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The highlight is a visit to the Evening Meal Church.
There the leaders learn the history of the building of the church and gain insights into the development of the Evangelical Church in a periphery and through Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
There are maps at the register of the nuclear cellar museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US business.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask written questions or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax in appeal to unrestrained circles who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it was said.
A Snowdens exit from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany is an ally of the USA, Snowden threatened to deliver there, said it further
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winner's title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided on the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf as the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
Fun at tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament lead was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were punctual with Michael Klipel and Sadmin Osmic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler) so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klipel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
The successful sound of the tournament took place at late afternoon sun and coffee and cake.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing for each age is to do so.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 to 5 pm.
In the museum workshop is also worked.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push cart racing or staging.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour through the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock each.
On an terrain tour, the children must guess what stories of truth are or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a bus ride with Black Forests Füchsen.
Not only horses, but also many other animals like sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children on Sunday can look forward to the Clown Otsch, who drives his snack with the museum guests from 11 o'clock.
Cosy and fairy tale-like, Hermann Büttner is visiting.
The storyteller takes the small guests at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock to the wonderful world of fairy tales.
The children's dance group from Gutach also performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
On both days from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the besenbinder, the nearer, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can also look over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town Burt Muro is considered to be an adorable Kuz because he decided to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not to be taken away from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the movie there are coffee, tea and cakes.
Schrills Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the halde.
The company has several irons in the fire at its location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the campground in front of the dike.
Distribution or loading of two massive blue semi-trailers or recharging the coal here as required.
Every movement of the envelopers sounds a shrill warning noise over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are prescribed by law," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavorable wind, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the town council.
He took the lawsuits very seriously and therefore contacted the people concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now necessary to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he also set out to engage in open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot ahead of him at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 metre-deep dock form terminal, Capesize Bulkcarrier can long ago be made here.
"This year, we want to knock the 3-million-tonne mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still connected to the grid, then about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three shipwrecks on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern Basketballer in spite of first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in Euroleague could not reduce the enormous optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe over the past two years," Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic, after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clarified in the decisive stages.
The guests first managed the piece of art to turn a 15-point set back 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piraeus once again gave the game a turn.
"We have incredibly fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made another ludicrous mistake," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichers, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish track-bearer Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years Fay's innovation was expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Caroline's and then became more and more successful until they were too familiar to appear in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefiz event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others, perform.
With the festival the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of Comedians who attend the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Krull was known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-sloping fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the lineup both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Krull and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, concentrated on racial themes, W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors magnets in the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in Larry's entire work's Comedy DNA," Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process with the five UN-Vetomas and Germany a week before the next nuclear meeting.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last years," said Foreign Minister Mohammed Jshawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
Although it would be a long way to go, the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will find a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game chamberads with machete
Two children were killed in Uruguay by an 11-year-old.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played soccer in front of their apartments in a workers' quarter.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old sister of the disciple whom they had taken with her should state that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys committed the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Holder has to go to prison
Because of exploitative trafficking in human beings, maintenance, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years imprisonment.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a barter after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women through Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had bought him for some years.
By confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he made contacts with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who gave the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan killed him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus of a reduced guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, after a first display, at least four more cases of ex-US trade in human beings could be identified by telephone surveillance measures.
The heard conversations had been marked by great aggression.
In subsequent hearings, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, one of the women who had discovered bruises all over the body, has not yet made any statement.
It is about "a totally broken personality" that violence and exploitation in this metier sees itself as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He has broken out of these circles and wants to live a very normal life after imprisonment," he said.
Oil price continues after up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price also continued to fall on Friday, after concerns about a high supply overestimated a report according to which the energy-intensive manufacturing sector of China is growing.
The reference crude oil varieties for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cent in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a fall in the price of 5.8 percent in October.
The big oil supply has burdened prices over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Energy Ministry announced on Wednesday that the U.S. offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had risen by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of increased activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery in China's economy, which had grown to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil from Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by US refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-free policy of the NYPD
On Thursday, a federal appeal court in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ("Anhalten und Browseen") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge of the case.
The Second U.S. Appeals Court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until an appeal of the city was made.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city instituted appeals against its assessment and the planned remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
The appeal court heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by providing that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyism; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had judged, police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they improperly target black and Latin American men with the stop-and-free program into the visor.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including reforms in policy, training and supervision, and organised a pilot programme with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-free tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights activists.
Controls of this kind have been available in different forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of the no-party mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men belonging to all minorities filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-free program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police bureaus use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would dampen police morals, but not criminality; also money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that, after thousands of places were lost, would be under pressure in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-free practice that was constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implements the controls.
Of the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helfende Handen".
On Saturday afternoon the 10th birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first president told Henne in detail about the work of the association.
He was himself the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the interventions were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former German border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and, according to her, is now planning to work in advisory function at the club.
In 2008, the Schimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the health centre in Socogim, a wretched quarter on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of almost a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, de-acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political turmoil in the country, it was not possible to travel as many as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospitate here in various areas.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, bandage materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local coloring by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to mobile goat stalls and the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "Telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court found out.
"In the opinion of the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the Emergency W, is not one who stands before the home of people hoping to catch them in a fresh act, but one who likes to confront people with a story in order to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW is using three methods to research stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He argues, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editorship of NotW, when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't swear your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voice mails on their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as projects.
During the time the research was running, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had been confronted by an affair with a married woman when he himself was in love with the defendant Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protesting against the planned Reich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without results.
In the conflict around the rich tax, the government and professional football in France have managed to get into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received and listened to their complaints on Thursday at the Paris Élysée-Palast Association and Association Representatives.
However, he refused to dispose of the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite was also hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, the chief association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days spent in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore not the same.
Circumstances: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," Mayor Jens Häussler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
According to Häussler, the flood, which happened unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been a crucial event that raised the question of protection measures for the future.
A river area study had been commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protection of as many land as possible is the aim," says Häustler.
Due to the planning of protection against a high water expected to occur every 100 years, according to the German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% increase.
In disciplines this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häustler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, where the municipality can expect to receive national grants of around 70 percent.
However, Häussler pointed out that funding was only given when an overall concept was implemented.
To this end, the community should be dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be carried out.
In the best case, implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm River from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to address their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why there were no more dams and reservoirs planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hillsheim, who introduced the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
Moreover, one was kept to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Inadvertently, the old-town laymen who, even in normal thunderstorms, have always suffered from overloads of the channel network.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
However, Häussler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two or three-year rain events could be carried out.
To scale the wastewater ducts bigger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were severely injured on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf during a frontal collision.
The police locked the road immediately completely, but could say little at first to the accident.
However, there are several witnesses who should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old handlebar of a VW golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles were collapsing together, and the woman was so heavily clamped that the fire brigade needed almost half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both accidents occurred in nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a godseeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Astounding the relationship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski with his massive oeuvre can be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet who is quite a bit considered in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technological progress, paired with paranoia, security delusion and faith to be chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read themselves like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He understands early on that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the creator of his creation.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderieten-Report" dates back to 1956, and exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy-Tribunale.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is frighteningly similar to ours, mutants look into the future - and the police are attacking.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." You read streams of time.
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal idea from being actually implemented.
Dick's story acts as the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and the noise of the NSAs.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what's left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and a future crime is committed.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own requirements.
Not only do errors and victims buy, but they build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick is always talking about getting closer to the truth.
Spear shops about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US competition for Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask written questions or personally meet the 30-year-old in Russia, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Green-Federal Congressman Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden yesterday as the first German politician in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures strengthen company paranoia due to state supervision
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of Constitutional Affairs and the Fight against Terrorism (BT), the German Internal Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word change between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the US should not use any means of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits."
But since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower, started publishing his full-horn of US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the Director.
Reports according to which the American National Security Agency spys on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had changed, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get on the road, then management is certainly also a potential goal.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the USA was now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published by the EY consultants in July.
However, in Snowden’s documents, there has so far been no evidence that the US has passed on the company secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Bundestag suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical refinement of US spying agencies discovered by Snowden disclosures have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the disclosures about the US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members were planning to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been that way.
"It was a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level, as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, because that brings advantages to attackers.
In large companies employees have long been bled that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or the unattended letting of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, mildly said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board of directors at Automaker Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," warns the BT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel, the US National Intelligence Estimate was placed behind China in the ranks of two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Internal Intelligence Service, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, like at least the wedding celebration was successful, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Represented were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept up.
It's starting at the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or cream.
At the front are the often smoked and embroidered dresses, often with a veil, but they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
Since however, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house clothing miller.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
Important was the selection of the premises, was explained.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"But cats are also popular for young girls' farewells," he says.
Romantics are also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion the "After-Wedding Photo" - i.e. series of recordings in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dogs Friends Successful
For repeated times the sportsmen of the dog friends Bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12th place with 87 points.
With her Woody in Class 1, Susi Höpp presented himself with the critical views of the power judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a coiled ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family attorney on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in an upright mat that was behind the grandstand in the school gym.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but this is doubtful about the 17-year-old's family.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, Kenneth's lawyer and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff had concluded.
"They believe that it avoids any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as the common sense," says Crump.
Rather, they were convinced that the truth would be obscured in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and returned to the body bag," he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, has caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would commission the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Department was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they were hoping that the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
CDC publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US government, as the number of school-based children with food allergies increases.
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin available – the auto injection of EpiPen is most commonly used – in order to respond to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin more readily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: 'It feels like something is pressing on my tongue', 'my tongue feels like a hair' or 'my tongue is crawling'.
Parents of inter-sex children can choose "sexually undetermined"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear gen Italy.
Newborns are no longer assigned to rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but can state "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make overarching decisions regarding operations for gender allocation in newborns and combat discrimination against inter-sexuals.
According to the BBC years later, an intersex person said: "I am neither man nor woman."
I keep the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year will not be born as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eggs or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds for a good thing".
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not have this," he said.
One can make a sexual allocation without surgery and then wait for the development of identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity is not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexuals.
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexuals should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both defined at the same time or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairing, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of discrimination, which is exposed to intersexual and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not consistent with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first 'sexual' person after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a 'non-determined' gender status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third allocation, X for intersexuals, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "heavy theory" should be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law, stating: "If the world is divided into a new state where gender represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we twist two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn child from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she felt better when babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"parenthood is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt.
However, in the meantime the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted after now is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned to them.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a "psychiatry emergency," said Drescher.
When such a child was born, the psychiatrist was not called, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with non-specific genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who expressed the view that the gender is formal.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental violations – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped the way a person views himself as male or female.
However, in a case known as John/Joan from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from the child during a dirty circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he killed himself.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practise this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, who are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author, who was born with XY-human chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal patch.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and allowed his breasts to be removed.
By surgery, it has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexuals to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can encourage "depreciation and stigmatisation".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make fast decisions and to assign a ‘undetermined’ to the child,” she explained.
We fear it will favour interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait for it.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect itself, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because 'it enables adults to recognize as a third sex'.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children to do so at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "administrative" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor order effect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the children's psychiatry.
Although she is barren, she hopes to be able to have a child by adoption or a leim mother.
"The law gives parents room, which means they don't have to make overarching decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "human" or "female".
This way everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy your parents' happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving around because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shooting from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt with shots from a car.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the perpetrators had probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That's what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was easily wounded on the left.
Rescue officers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out it was called Friday.
Until now, police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called to egg-throwing children only twice, who cast them against house facades.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the earlier ones, no material damage should have occurred either.
In addition, some Sylvester bulls have probably also been lit in the city area, but no damage to property has occurred here too.
A resident in the Bischoff-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in claws and his mulch was discarded.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his radiance lights in the immediate vicinity of everyone, so the police didn't have to continue working.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" Waltraud Ries asks, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment at the age explains it.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty has had to experience on her own what it means to move to the floor with handicap from stockwork.
Recently a book by her has appeared on the topic 'Happy Living in Age - What is the best way to live for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work at all', she starts to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of greenery.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are at all dealing with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them push it out as long as it's possible.
All things are always going to be just the others', she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think about it.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living at the age.
'But what kind of dwelling one chooses is always an individual decision', she explains.
D e solution does not apply to age.
Even those who could afford the old age residence in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country one is also united in the Dolce Vita,' the expert book author gives thought to the desire to settle abroad.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner-WG.
At age everyone has such ticks and tricks
'It would be such a community of dwellings for me, but nothing' she thinks with a twinkling of her eyes.
Not at all like in a student toilet with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'You just need your retirement rooms at your age', says Ries.
Nevertheless, the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a community of elderly people can still work.
But this had to happen differently than in the classic student-wG.
And sometimes you just want his rest', she believes.
With this view, at least in the capital of the country, it is not there alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Civil Service Life at the age of the capital.
Their service advises people about the topic 'Be older'.
Therefore, even older people would often also buy inconveniences and restrictions, just to remain in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the remodeling of their home or their home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commission the first best craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the old-fashioned conversion.
Even in the rental apartment it is possible to realize something, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior architect explains.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment on an age-appropriate and therefore barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
It is true that within the apartment you could install a staircase lift, which would also be paved with stairs up to the apartment door, but that would be much bigger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she cries more than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden criminally
The U.S. has not changed its attitude to former U.S. secret service employee Edward Snowden.
He is still being accused of having freely disclosed secret information.
Therefore, he had to go to the United States for a criminal trial, said the U.S. Secretary, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Neither would Snowden's recent statements change anything about it.
Previously, German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a Snowden meeting in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were about a parliamentarian rather than that of a German government member.
Secret Service Thüller Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This has been clarified by the former NSA staff of the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, Bundestag and the Federal Public Prosecutor.
The letter has the following wording after a translation spread by Ströbele:
To the Conscientious
I was asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be involved in direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which made me act out of a moral obligation.
As a result of the release of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently in exile and enjoy temporary asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also senior officials, including the United States, have assessed the disclosures of a system of comprehensive monitoring that nobody is accountable to as a public service.
These espionage disclosures attracted many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed misuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society derived from these findings are becoming increasingly clear and, at the same time, the risks taken in purchases have been clearly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive, my government continues to treat Dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political opinion and to bring it to trial.
Nevertheless, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this depressive attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is clear and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
At its recent meeting, the municipal council approved the sale in non-public part.
The building changed its owner to an "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied", Maier emphasizes.
There were 100 000 euros in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter, so it is no longer necessary to come up for the entertainment of the house, like heating, to look at the garden and to clear the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is delighted.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clockstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, explains the pieces of music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first shock of music.
Report: Obama campaign planned to replace bees with Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heidemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that will be published in the near future and on Thursday evening she reported that the president's top advisers had carried out 'extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011' to find out whether Obama's falling hope for reelection would be better if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times' national political correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact it has on the survey values of exchanging former Foreign Minister Clinton against the vice president.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest consultants – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House executive consultants, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the change in mind.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the top of the effort to exchange bids despite its "any personal relationship" before finally opting for such a check-up after the data showed that the candidate Clinton's "would not significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually thought about replacing bees with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley in the magazine.
One must recall that the President had terrible poll values at that time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "precautionary care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train was paying off with regard to the elections.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the President was "conscious of the possible change", the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political scatterings had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigation of whether to drop bids in the elections.
"Possible", Martin replied.
What happens on the way with my email?
Yes, e-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail as technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, as in the traditional post?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not provide a stable basis for a responsive exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user sends "Anna" to "Benni" an e-mail, are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider who uses Benni.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Will traditional e-mails be read along their way through the network?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the way.
In the case of the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least deleted from a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood that unauthorized people will read an email is extremely low.
But theoretically this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take notice of e-mails.
There are also possible illegal outbursts.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against read-only.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it cannot even be recognized without anyone else who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes, according to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to raise significantly from Google.
Mother in the forest scorched and pension collected
When his defendant mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police police investigations in the forest in order to continue her pension and care allowance.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-olds, and then for more than a year and a half, he canceled the money.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, it was found that no drugs were needed for the mother in need of care.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this occurred strangely to the officials, they continued to identify.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had taken care of them last.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Is it like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a brilliant treatise.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH and the ice are rising.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because it's four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible and for itself due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly made artificially by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six playing days.
For the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow, the Derby is coming against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads open," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete cadre at his disposal.
Daverden, too, like us, puts on a tempo game.
We therefore need to keep our error rate low.
Above all, however, it is important to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a sure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to do some reading in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte is missing, Jodat.
The A-Jewish Joost Windsßust, who is active in the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut for this purpose.
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffel.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I do not think it will do so this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Confederation of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion U.S. dollar issued, according to NRF.
This year, exhilarating inanimate objects are the last cries.
Women no longer have to cover up in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Dust Point space men will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone in my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as candy is concerned, we're not being overly sensitive.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, lutschern, bonbons and gum bear.
So good news for 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who pass through the neighborhood with the saying 'Sweet or Saures'.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we will not do anything – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Commodity Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names like 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spit houses in the United States that achieve 500 million dollars of revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which one is just peeping in the pants and then putting the friends on Facebook, where one will not get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which one stands leaves a comment like "net facial expression".
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and the carving of a pumpkin latter is like the decorating of the Christmas tree – something that we've done from a little.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin latterns, slowly rotting in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some pretty out of their 921 kilo of heavy pumpkin.
Flat fires in Helmbrechts: rescue forces mountains coal-fired bodies
The fire brigade had to express itself in Helmbrecht on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night.
The rescue forces contain a charred body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames came out of a window.
The forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spoke further.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
Background is a possible pastoral shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran Land Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halved by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Office.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people for theology studies.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology according to the Abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of ecclesialization: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and can focus on where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for this theologians would have a secure employer.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with a meaningful job.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a wide range of training.
You can even become President of the Federal Republic.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-standing system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for a accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the steps and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge wagons – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day at the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called fire brigade to rescue a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock promontory in a quarry
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had escaped after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her misplaced position
Firefighters sailed on rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a dog that was stuck on a 15-meter-high advantage in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel Queen Ruby had run off after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when she had escaped from the quarry after the small traffic accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to position and sailed to rescue Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like a stiff-frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog pies.
That was quite an unusual use.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a technical rescue specialist, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was sent to the veterinarian for examination, but he did not notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Looking at the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had grown too large and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs."
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry said she ate dinner with the old rocker, and that he "skinned me when I was 18".
She added: "It's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "dedicated categorically that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on site 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European decomposition gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic advantages that more freedom of travel would bring with it in the rest of Europe, but it did not play a role in the headlines – as expected.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what is really wanted by the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already come in such a way that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" dinner at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost during the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why trade the London Joch against that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe after the war has become a reality.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
EU-wide, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to cast just under five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the compulsory jacket to which the respective national economy is required by maintaining the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the excessive budget deficits caused by national governments – only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members to exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are behind a deeper problem of European productivity.
As a result of the 'green' energy directives adopted by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays the double for electricity and gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage fixtures do not protect European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner of cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt draws up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris to the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has expressed its own economic policy, with which the French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy front National has just won a decisive post-election and thus referred the governing socialists to place three.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well at these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' that favored General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in hopes of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whatever it is to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I think Scotland could be doing quite well in a more loose European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similarly thoughtful countries is easier in a non-Federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway as well as our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to assume.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now just to get a austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Paediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is now rapidly entering," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axe hairs as well as body smell, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarches (the appearance of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to get to the menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is true that breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before eight years of age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
In the event of faster advance, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and resisting another episode: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," said Kaplowitz.
'It was a shock' remembers a woman whose daughter has had her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys like girls come to puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing precedent is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged from six to nine who establish a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow their facial and sham hair earlier, the trend towards a full-scale past puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is widespread even in babies and toddlers.
"We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as to how to talk to their child.
"This can mean having a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute large orders over seating width
Among leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a discussion about the width of tourist-class seats in long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seat that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines make the most of, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co...
Airbus requested this week an industry standard that prescribes a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that should be decided by the airlines.
The discussion comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are series of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new Mini Jumbo design will deliver.
Boeing claims that his modernized "777X" phase 406 persons are seated in the tourist class, which is over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 persons in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hieb about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus appeals to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed money providers a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant squeezing together, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats, which are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
Faced with changing eating habits, people get thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and by the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the U.S. Ministry of Health.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century, according to US health statistics, is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival was in favour of a 1950s seat concept when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus's number of seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between air fares and equipment.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It is really important to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful," explains the cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect turnover.
Behind the discussion is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US billion US dollars according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeings' statements on the results depend in part on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper fares.
"eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 777," says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-trading jet sellers even carry band sizes to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not sold yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make smoking fun feel better
Scientists have developed an anti-Nikotin vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Prior to human testing, further tests are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried out all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained normal activity levels.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time off", the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the level of the antibody that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be used for people if he was sure that children would be given before they tried to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
"They then know that if they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put away the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi contests to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the New South Wales laboratory party Joe Tripodi, an investigation is initiated by the state anti-corruption authorities.
The former NSW Minister contests to have amended the rules on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission on Corruption) extended its investigations on the question of whether obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the obeids operated two restaurants and a café without invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined by the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the property after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had announced accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for lease contracts.
The tenants opposed it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, lease contracts for companies were extended to Circular Quay, which made the obeis 2.5 million dollars a year, without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Harbour from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally expressed support for public tenders.
However, he refused to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed for a redesign of the government's lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC’s telephone copies showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
'Where was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations about the preparation of commercial lease arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a senior government employee against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air raids on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'reality tests'.
The government is thinking in the context of extended measures on a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used by means of a criterion designed to prevent the use of 457 for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
“Sustainable explanations such as “Foreigners should be in the back” and “for Australians first” are a very unpleasant setback in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to take an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in charge yesterday of talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the 'proprietary criterion' is accepted, a person requesting a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is true in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the assisting undertaking'.
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past hundreds of companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have stopped.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumant probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be made as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring the UK closer together'.
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings the UK and its cities closer together."
We're going ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary, Alistair Carmichael, commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for an "indisputable" approach to Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, to create the advantages for everyone and to complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to adopting the next steps together.
Provisional entry into force of rules on electronic equipment in aircraft in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the USA to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read e-books, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air mode".
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books at the time of take-off and landing.
Australia's companies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines in large quantities of work, but do not follow immediate plans to amend their rules.
The Air Safety Authority CASA also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
'The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft' has been stated.
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines maintain security at all times and that passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already had talks with CASA about expanding the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that one is open to change, but this would have to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a verification of the authorisation of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that you will remain with the current regulations until more.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not currently have any plans to change this," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US carriers.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will certainly take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different for US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer training.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in the case of poor vision, the crew will assign passengers to switch off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be stored safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats at the time of take-off and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund subsequently proclaimed severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football league against the VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered to the viewer until shortly before the hint of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests with their songs were listening.
The South Tribunes, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stood, initially presented themselves exceptionally silent: no songs, no battle calls.
The Capo's podium, which otherwise coordinated the common cheer, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the tribune, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Ban".
Only when Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller entered the place as always the first BVB player, branded up short-term jubilee.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and wailing scars - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune.
Also, that stadium speakers Norbert Dickel listed once again the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, extension of contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration moods.
Only five minutes before the tap, the Capo climbed his podium - and until then, the tension that can be grasped with hands escaped in a loud scream when, as usual, Dickel questioned the mood on the slopes of the stadium.
The last one was as always the South Tribune on the row - and finally was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call for "Derby victor stands up" came with a hint of the South Tribune, everything was like always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Right in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the co-controlled BVB supporters fired rockets into the crowd and into the square - and almost hit Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was tweaked due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras afterwards in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather tireless date for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB-Boss on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke denied the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I didn't do that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will issue a sanction by the end of the next week.
"This is going to be cutting," assured Wattke.
One may be excited about how the reactions to the South Tribune will then turn out.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
Janani Amirthäpha in Singapore offers a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters in a pawn shop in Bendemeer Shopping Centre.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirtkalea.
Although she earned 3,000 Singapore dollars every month (about EUR 1,730) as an administrative employee and also works her husband, she explains that the monthly family income is not enough.
In fact, demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – is so great that, where it has made its exchange, ValueMax became the third pawnhouse this week, listed on the Singapore stock exchange.
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore dollar in the case of Janani Amirthähea – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, panther houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest of 17 percent, which is just over 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgages offer the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or income statements here, which makes loans faster than banks can.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops, after families feel the pressure due to increasing cost of living, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for pawnhouses to compensate for the difference in stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency called Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has just come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a neglect of consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that in view of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in the gold prizes over the past two years have reinforced the trend towards the pledge of personal items, as people are taking the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 houses of the city state of gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pawnhouse operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn shop is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the investment in Singapore.
While some lenders have gone into crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnhouses not only pay more favourable interest than other lenders but also not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already own and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing in society.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social layer come to us.
"These include those who are well-off who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.
NSA extracts data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Edward Snowden's secret service unveiler has an interest in helping Germany in the clarification of the ever-increasing NSA companies.
At his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the German public prosecutor's office, said that under what conditions the ex-secret service staff would declare in a German prosecutor's office or in front of a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is faced with the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth would take 'unfortunate measures' to avoid a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after governmental consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has set up an emergency rescue package which, in our view, is facing the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325-million dollar package includes 31 million dollars instant assistance for election services.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star, should eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been told by the clinic staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would make the public health system more sustainable.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a great contribution to removing the federal state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the public health spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a 'pflaster solution'.
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts in the Commonwealth 300 million and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday, while serious collisions were taking place in the north of the country near one of the sites where potentially toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, set up in The Hague by Damascus to destroy or 'unoperable' all chemical weapons plants, including all machinery for mixing chemicals to poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria is no longer able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fighting took place in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian human rights observatory based in the UK.
On Thursday, the activist group, which is pursuing the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria, declared that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but didn't mention any details.
The fights underline the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, for their mission to free Syria from its poisonous arsenal of weapons is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced its destruction.”
That is why 'there are currently no other inspection activities planned'.
At the beginning of the week the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the reviews and had visited 21 out of 23 locations indicated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been "discharged ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other named facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw the hat from the bravery and courage shown by you all in completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," explained Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
Regarding further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Annoyance over conviction for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in 2002 at the Bali bombing reacted angryly to the verdict of the last of the instigators who were brought to trial, as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in court.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most sought-after people, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
In addition, a debt statement was made in a series of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, even if they could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as a master bomber because of his reputation as a 'demolition man'.
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who has lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation of Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
She said that Patek should have been sentenced to death with tears.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"It should be put before a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I won't have another granddaughter and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was likened to the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a huge bomb exploded in a small cargo parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for one month after the attack and died three times, while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers standing in court.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't stood up," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown any regrets about how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek may still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
From departure to landing, travelers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and use the image of movies, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, depending on the respective airline, explains FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the equipment storage arrangements in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that they have already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
" Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," said the FAA in a statement.
Passengers currently have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They can start again only after the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
Upon entering the landing, the passengers must turn it off again and must not start it again until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been retrofitted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit," commented Glading.
Frankly, we are sorry to have to feel like watchmen on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to transfer smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight path.
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be stowed because there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may ban certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, said safety experts for national transport on CBS news, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb transmitters," says Rosenker.
A industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies it is the speech that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the switch off of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966, after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices had become known by passenger-borne VHF radios, which then represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation if you flip.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the drivers of a relaxation of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but none could detect them.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt that the interference with the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about interference of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the switching off of the equipment by passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor conditions of view.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who today would be equipped extensively with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by Air Rescue Service of North Sea Bohr Island Saved Birds Again
A flying bird that had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island by air rescue service to the coast was released into the wild again.
The water rallies were flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where they were picked up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, Head of the Centre, said: "This water gale was probably a winter bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water slides were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to make business with Britain?
Business for Britain was set up in April with the intention of putting the economy at a table and defining what those in the UK who are concerned with wealth and work want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Great Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 executives from the economy, representing around British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the states are stagnating in the EU.
They want government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, asked about certain issues regulated by law – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with what is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably most likely to say, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants to take a course towards changing the agreement and not a policy-based relationship with the EU.
This insight, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pressing for a 'sensible change' that brings the issue of action back to Great Britain.
It is a great deal – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating British membership conditions.
It also shows that the companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Great Britain from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro zone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means that businesses are more focused on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom describes Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors explained.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began," said Gazprom's Chairman of the Board of Management, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes across Europe.
A treaty between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "always" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted tariffs when the entire project enters into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th property day of the stock exchange newspaper.
German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed this out on the 9th property day of the stock exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, the search for German commercial properties shows the view of the transaction volume.
In the first three quarters of this year it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's section.
In the UK the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The return distance between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA allows restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if telephone calls with the mobile phone remain prohibited.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before 2011 accusations against the child caretaker Jonathan Lord were raised from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that 'in the organization, it had never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse'.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which an YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography for crimes, and another where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of the abuse of trusted children in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second one.
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission had also been incorrect in the claim that "there had been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety".
However, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible candidates in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed 'from me down' in the recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of the child safety directives.
At the beginning of the year, Lord had been convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare argues that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for her as babysitter, let her sit on his lap, told someone that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the head of the child service Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's superior in the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very impenetrable".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to return their superior report.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord affected their judgment, so they did not report him.
Hare stated that he had informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to be drawn by the organization from the "Jonathan-Lord incident" was "not reporting" by employees, and the Management Board had agreed to it.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secret keeping obligations shortly after the charges occurred had been taken by the Managing Director of the child services of YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this would prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'over-extended' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011, when Jonathan Lord was working there, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, Commission expert on sexual child abuse, explained.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in recruiting, reviewing, integrating, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard with the words: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so..."
When the horse show experts found themselves in Scharen in Cardiff to crown the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But none were prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee ran loosely through the three laps and got the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons he had put his plate cap on a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which is far above his age.
And toffee got best marks for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received his third birthday as a gift last March and since then practised with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and left the square with goldpokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nanttyllo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified, and everyone cheered him up and clapped him up."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens for which he cares.
Just as he started, it won't take long until he's on the "Pferd of the Year" show – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jury then evaluated Fenton and Toffee, how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the presentation ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton's sweet clothes contributed to her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is supposed to be "reformed" after calling
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been charged with diffamation, was to be reformed on the cover, explained a press regulator.
The New Express, based in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery to fake reports about a state-owned company.
Now the New Express is being subjected to a 'wide-ranging recitation', the regulator explained.
The 'Rectification Order' was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized", the regulator announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license.
In addition, “Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full correction of the New Express and has been recommended to identify the relevant controllers at the New Express and to review the new Express Executive Team without delay.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the cover and was behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the state news channel CCTV.
I did it first of all because I was out for money and fame.
I realized I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the Neue Express published an apology on the title page and explained that it was not possible to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The US authorities described the 120 x 90 centimeter measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconceivable warehouses, which makes it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could not be transported in it, the authorities explained.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the authorities, were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between the ages of ten and the years of their lives when they are guilty.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 640 meters long with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself at the separation of his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan it or hope it will go".
Kerr and he himself still loved him, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son, Flynn, was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs considerably from that.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong edamer, they do not stand on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, next to the loss of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains is one may wonder, but with closer consideration the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Brothings are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local reform house, who has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan has lived, and in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
By the turn of the century the next step then took place and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers regular leather.
He realized that other everyday concerns are not animal products.
In the first place, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the maximum of vegans that extend to the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of trusting in burgers, scramblers or rubber bears, the vegan has quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm has increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually, vegan doesn't represent absolution, it's not an ascetic, it's an enrichment."The assumption that with food conversion, one reduces the selection of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And these very conditions also led some to fail so well-intentioned attempt.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," explains Proctor.
And apply: "Some tasters are not attached to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that makes up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste thoroughly even once.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce on animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegans.
"My blood values are good, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegan simus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the cold rest, the vitamin B12 content is high," says Proctor.
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor for food procurement did not have to go far-reaching.
Food is finally available everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find it on the spot.
From time to time, I buy something special.
"Many people overlook that just the finished products are expensive, but this is how it is known for "normal" finished products."
In any event, the preparation of vegan dishes was much cheaper and less time consuming than generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese smokes, Proctor could also cause his sweaters to wonder.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, if you cook together, it has a new importance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism has already been shown to him.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to tempt enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as assumed - and the vegan doesn't as limited in everyday life as commonly accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes is everywhere!
"Many dönerläden offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he turns to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants sit on it so slowly.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult", the New Zealander can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it".
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the cabin in Mannheim or the café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the most of it impossible," says Proctor.
The purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at first.
Especially when one learns to understand which can also be contained in peanuts animal additives as dyers, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only that is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that food but also detergents are used.
"After and after, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or stumble," knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingering that strikes the consciousness.
Maybe he doesn't make it all the way to laying down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
The trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. option markets, including two of Nasdaq OMX, continued their business without hindrance.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger stakes with the stock exchange operator.
It was only Tuesday that Nasdaq's indexes had not been calculated for one hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock market in the USA came to an end because of a computer pan on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
Moreover, last year the Facebook stock exchange had taken care of appearances.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later established the stock exchange supervision SEC and diluted the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-olds around
According to the police, the accident had occurred when a 26-year-old man was on his way on Thursday night, around 10:00, with a women's bike in orderly on the left walk from the station square towards the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the road from a local road, the cyclist, according to the police, could no longer slow down in time.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the floor in the further course and attracted a square wound about 15 centimetres long.
A rescue team brought the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police are sending Assange a delivery message
The British police have today handed a delivery order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had been asked to stand up and ask him to appear in a police guard, and added that if he did not comply, he threatened to arrest him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after his possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver it to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “has asked a 40-year-old man to come to a police station at one of our chosen time,” said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police appeal.
Assange fears being handed over from Sweden to the United States and accused of possible espionage charges there after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver, who was hit with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs, receives 1,000 pounds of punishment
A driver was charged a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on 27 May with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester District Court, Howie was guilty without the necessary care and attention being paid.
He received seven points and a six-month ban.
In addition, howie was sentenced to pay 90 £ as well as a 100 £ victim supplement.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments costing more than two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as company and not as individuals.
Even now, income from the municipal property tax in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, totaled revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the region of Humber.
Cook said: "After the increase in stamping tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of associated legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant about buying real estate in London, or stop selling it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous Southwest belt of London, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, have cost a record of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a rising domestic market, on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a savillis study.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog's cocksucking and its mood.
Earlier research had shown that lucky dogs with their tail were more rolling to the right (from the dog's point of view) while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral whistling of their arthropods, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we'll soon understand why the cock moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But was the tail inclination mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog, who thrives), so their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience, which movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and wading with the tail in one direction is rather linked to friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert in dog behavior and host grant at the Faculty of Animal Medicine of the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year a team of Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they watch an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, stated: “Dogs go to a robotic dog rather than to the left, if their “swanz” wobbles and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – exactly the opposite as in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw says.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it probably will not take long for us to understand why the cock sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners’ disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been infected with the inflammation of the throat.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be performed.
The announcement of the band came after she had to postpone an appearance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at the medical board, Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November."
"For Alex Turner, a cranial inflammation has been diagnosed, which is why unfortunately he cannot occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which was held in the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets retain validity for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.

Pope Francis appointed first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was first appointed to the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergyman in the Catholic church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 "chosen cardinals".
In an explanation in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as Consistorium, was held.
" Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to consecrate the Consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valerio of Catholic Voices said that the number of electorate cardinals would probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of electorate cardinals would return to 120, and as many cardinals as he would like.
The Consistorium next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, says Valerio.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinal Council, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valericus.
He said it was "good possible" that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been able to do so – that is all new.
Valericus said that the bishops would typically be called cardinals from large places, but Francis put “full surprises – so we do not know who he is appointed”.
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors calls back just under 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with the 2014 construction year to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a announcement by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
With some of the cars there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal guidelines on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"When driving up from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury," the message was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The withdrawn models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA failed to review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were re-developed for the 2014 model year, rose by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation cry of an Obama selector
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He said Obama had made commendable efforts that had been thwarted by the blockade tactics of Republicans.
The blockade policy does not excuse the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible, sad book right now.
It's a book that I thought it would cheer me up during the crazy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama on the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient literature in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath.
The election was held to a landslide victory and a message speaker in order to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama joined office in 2008, he had 82% voting values.
And then I'll close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening as if one is torn from a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military deduction from Iraq, the end of forced secrecy of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party political blockade tactics have cut too many attempts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I came to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why you allow the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, which exposes state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without a trial, nor why the public funding and expenditure limits will be circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the 'aggressiveest ... since the Nixon government'.
And lately, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the office of a Member is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
With Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative, he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, that the hope we had been hearing about for so long would be fulfilled.
However, with the reduction of the values of approval for Obama to below 45 % this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have broken in the air.
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to put a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electorate after the decision he told his employees that they had to come back to course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest during parental leave
Billionaire and Member of Parliament Clive Palmer say Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The Mining Magnate, who is in a judicial dispute about the payment of $6 million of CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are being deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, Palmer's electoral commission, with 53 votes, officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process to allow the vote to be counted more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be held two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why don't we have a system where you're marching into a computer, choosing the data immediately and then having the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if they don't like you?
Voting with pencils nowadays is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy was to have an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new post "very serious".
A public office is about public service.
"We seek no reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange division, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market, on which 5.3 billion US dollars a day change the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal is moving around the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation related to the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been given leave from his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was given leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher's Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said the situation was close.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently working on allegations that bankers have agreed to deal with transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar people.
Banks get instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that, despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that "you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The news came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced that she had this week canceled a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund Office after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars in late last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is under control," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle base piece
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has adorned the building fence on the Bechtle base at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and widened the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site is threatened to slip.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke on the BI.
Prior to the action of the BI, a transparent had been fitted with the message "We have been" for this.
However, this did not disturb the 20 or so members of the citizens' initiative in their actions.
Her motto on the big poster was "We're against the Bauruinen".
With this she wanted to point to the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day fail the giant project.
In a conversation with many passersby in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the project of the city will be much better, although not few of them have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start to resign because the city is delaying these answers further, it is said from the sides of the BI.
As you can hear, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he feared the resort for the thermal bath, should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem scared because of this, others feel like a "plump of extortion attempt" to the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shield for Shiris: Man no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sports director of the "bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalbenkönige category," he took the two offensive swirls into protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became an alleged actress - who was obviously none, as shown by the TV images.
"A harsh misdecision," said Rangnick, the referee Harkam called "overwhelmful".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmütsel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old emphasized.
However, in view of the success of the race, Rangnick adopted a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for this: very good," he noted.
There's not much to put on.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
I want you to keep doing this.
There will be hardly any frame changes in winter time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"In addition to a player, he wishes to leave the club," Rangnick made clear.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to complete a health insurance or to pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the tax authority of the State.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the board, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also considered the requirement of the Health Act that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state medical benefits should not be restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their gloomy valley.
Because of the low level of sun exposure, the rykan located in the west fjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters altitude, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swam at the start ceremony at the TV2 station.
Some of the valley dwellers rose up to sun chairs, others set up sunglasses for safety.
So far, the sun hungry had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post barely emptying Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red points for Sunday emptying are still on various letter boxes of the city centre and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
This was confirmed by a request from the FDP.
On Sundays and holidays only in front of the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether it is also taught Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
The Social and Youth Policy Speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to check this out.
Sunday emptying is an important post service right at the time of appointment.
"This undertaking thins down radically and improbably despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals' Group and Urban Association, supports his group colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the idle times are secretly changed or also deleted here."
From close to the citizen, the post is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays", says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the city centre, especially non-mobile citizens, a mailbox with Sunday emptying should also be able to reach in walking distance.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration is planning discussions with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out for privatisations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon be more expensive.
Today, the city's Magistrate advises about a presentation by road dezernant Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fee should therefore be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices, but to shorten the time interval between parking hours and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the City Council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the shop is "a non-underestimating advantage for smaller retailers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "very reasonable and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast action overshadow host
With a narrow cadre, Mr. I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb.
The apples were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that they were not able to keep up with the fast actions of the cities of joy, even as a result of old age.
With the hard and placed ups, the Gönninger was extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks played clean by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the net in the middle and were not in place at the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all their concerns.
In view of this oppressive and game-setting performance, the third sentence was then won a little loose and lustless to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make a clear impact in Nagold, there will be a significantly more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt met in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a toughly combated two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused, in particular, error and point gifts when taking the ball; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes lack of goods and in some critical playing scenes the Übereifer prevented the gaze for possible point gains.
However, in this highly balanced meeting, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
A group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach for the fifth day following the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald.
On this day, because of suggestions from the population, the public should be freed in the area of the hut of the view into the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the gorge on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to put emphasis on nature.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the greeting by the County Council of Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view is covered by the aim of maintaining the now heavily grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
They need these free joints for the conservation of the species.
Tribukait said she would not miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the maintenance days that have been achieved for the future.
After these different performances, the district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, the forest trawler was ready to call if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone rail.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Openings: Köppler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a trend-setting school, children's, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works can be considered an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been notified.
As the only candidate for the successor to the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for the age, has so far been the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter Köppler from Löffingen.
The application deadline will expire on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed for Nortel patents
On Thursday, the group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, imposed an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was offered by Nortel in the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is sued in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents involve technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the lawsuit that meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which competes with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was overtook by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google Motorola acquired mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google has failed with his attempt to acquire the patenters at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the complainant.
Rockstar claims a high compensation from Google as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt Celebrates First freely elected President
Mohammed Mursi leaves the county, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political strife in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was ordained as the first freely elected president of the country and was thus succeeded by Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his entry into office before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, who has his seat on the Nile and is embellished by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had since its founding usually been taken into the vision as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to cheer up the new president, and unlike the presidial prunk from Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only for a short time, so that the car convoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
His personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to achieve the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to judges in the wooden vaulted chamber in which he took the office.
Later, Mursi went to Cairo University, where he was supposed to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in custody.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university's largest auditorium with voice hearings from 'The Army and the people are one hand'.
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection, which led to the end of authoritarian rule Mubaraks, and he promised to demand back presidential powers, which the military council had taken over from the head of the government pursued from office.
But with the laying off of the official oath in front of the court and not as usual in front of Parliament, he bends to the will of the military, indicating that the battle for power will continue.
Mursis’ speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today's Friday night is "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening we continue with an SC 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers fell by ladder: severely injured
On Thursday a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was badly injured by the replacement of a faulty external sensor.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he stepped on the ladder leaned on the roof, this was slipping away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Salzburg Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rapeer in South Africa: Two Lifelong Detentions
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two years of life on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had caused national horror.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The young people's sight was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to having been in a bar during the actual night with Booysen.
He also confessed to have beaten and raped them, but he decided to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially left several perpetrators but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutors also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape already belongs to everyday life in South Africa: there are some 64,000 ads for sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark rate of sexual violence, however, for the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo", the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important thing for ham is the pork keules, turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working method of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Deutschland's favourite ham", as Jumbo announced to Schinken's Black Forest.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands first before he is allowed to touch the micro.
Sighted Jumbo for strengthening fast snacks in forest hay
"This is where I work huge quantities," marvels at the TV-maker, Schwarzwälder Schinken as a mass product.
16,000 throats a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco what happens then," Jumbo says cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that breaking the throats is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally without bones on the shelf.
The secret to ham is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tann branches ensure the special taste of black forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star's conclusion.
This will enable everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies belong thanks to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, in the first half of the year, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on the way towards record year's revenue before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and Great Britain, which typically belong to our strongest contributors.
In Australia the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which seems to be a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was equally good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the third year in a row is expected for the year as a whole.
The shares of Flight Centre rose yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are stopped to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also contains 'unseen texts' to stimulate wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE study for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
Tomorrow, the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less training.
In a speech in summer, Minister Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would "be more challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and pupils in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to set more time for mathematics in the timetable, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to take more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors will be presented by the Kreisverbandsverungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The reviews were made on Thursday
Again, the local club W514 is presenting this great exhibition.
Breeders of the associations existing in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six price judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed as the evaluation of all animals is appropriate to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., which includes the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola and to a deliciously equipped cafeteria at a wonderful price.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Museum of the Castle, the topic of "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on today's handling of the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches Salem, Salem Castle and Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question in the forum, how today people are classifying the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about this and put it on those images of heaven and hell, "which have shaped our ideas to this day", then the contemporary prophetic doctrine is characterized by hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out of Christianity and Christians by religious critique," says the speaker.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have come from us".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is why the question of that yearning, "that dreams of being all right in the end."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 with Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Small Heuberg affirm their commitment to the faith at the inauguration
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the soul care unit At Kleinen Heuberg have been established.
In the morning, the group accompanied the worship of Laudato-Si, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firmsakrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and received the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parish members, the Firmlinge had prepared themselves for the big holiday.
In various projects they came to know various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day together in Untermachtal.
Ilmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
214 cyclists came to Illmensee in wonderful weather to master the round course over the hills around the lake.
That's what Ulrich Knobel informs of the eventing Sportverein Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres, were also numerous everyone who wanted to practice their hobby once in the field of martial arts.
Two top German junior riders were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German championships.
These both were expected to depart from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small leap of time to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again able to place himself on second place.
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team's nightmare that made it up top to the winning steps.
On 2nd and 3rd, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance was the whole range of athletes represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
This year, there were even more absolute topathletes at the start of the main race.
Four drivers were able to depart from the top regional drivers.
Amongst them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half pro from the Black Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl has been World Champion twice in the twelve-hour careers together with a teammate.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already mentions his own two German championship titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude, there was an eyelash finale in the finish line in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl raced first over the finish line.
Only a second after that, the regular ballerstedt could secure second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race in the ladies' ranking.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sporters and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, just one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 persons.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not make a visit.
Two out of five people live in the country below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots let his decision mature in Bwelle to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the encased medical equipment on the roof over unsecured terrain into the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best place to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelling – with its wide smiles and its limitless energy – is happy at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip", says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crumbs, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but simply cannot afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local stunning.
The operations usually take place in a school, a town hall or an apartment; after the procedure the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and its volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work, it makes a huge difference to the people she is helping.
A man explained that the free operation of a performance breach that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes my family's future," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and is volunteering in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be there in operations where we help to shed blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over accommodation, transportation and instructions.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent the fight mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old hare in his metier, acting.
The old man Santiago can't do anything while fishing.
So the two simply complement themselves great.
You almost mean to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, about whom the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago sits tired of life on the chair, it's real with Janson.
Next to that is the role of the old fisherman through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his strength of will.
Janson is on stage in broad distances as a solo player.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment of boredom.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the light: Santiago's hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings with her songs and her wonderful voice Cuba's feeling of life.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Down to the Romans
On around 120 meters of length, below Cologne is a waste water channel from the Roman era.
If you visit Cologne, you will not pass the Cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers reach into the sky and make it Europe's second highest church building.
But few visitors, who marvel at the two filigree church towers, have no idea that there are also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism right at the Cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted an automobile-friendly city, so the rest of the old city walls only stood that which was not too big.
Most of the users of the parking lot are therefore hurrying by the Roman remains today and they only stop their car.
But those who look more closely discover an archaeological site separated by metal bars in the Parkdeck D2.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of handteller-sized stones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to daylight again, Schulze lets the participants at the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
Next stop of the tour is the Pretorium, and here the participants get back down to the depth.
We experience here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Presbyterian of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman Law and City of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the Praetorian is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the opening room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After he gets the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep walkable shaft.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washing.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go down to the eighth century, different water levels can be passed through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction work should begin shortly.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Leg almost hacked: Re-lay of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants are silent at the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutors proposed that three men, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, be stabbed in a car and taken in.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
Victims are said to have been part of Hell's Angels' competing group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars was preceded.
According to the charges, it was about the fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in a first proceedings at the beginning of 2012.
A court spokesperson said at the time that it had not been possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof withdrew the judgment following the revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for a further hearing.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offense.
At first glance it was mainly about reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner in charge at that time was invited.
In the center there were phone calls from the defendants and other people who had heard the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always adheres to a law for them in court - and not testify.
That also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor's Office Frankfurt (Oder) said that there have been new traces since the last trial.
There are eleven more negotiating days for the process.
The Wegwerfsgesellschaft does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it went home.
Only: In the books of the people on the passenger seat and seat back, hunger becomes evident.
Of course, one or another cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What's closer than chilling to go to the next drive-in to treat yourself a little bit?
I admit I'm happy to be with you when it comes to fast food heels late at night or early in the morning.
A couple of pommes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangsters become apparent.
Because what needs to be missing is that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends are discarded paper bags on roadsides and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home, respectively, to the next garbage bin?
It's not just that the paperwork divides the landscape.
Bags have also covered transport facilities such as signboards and caused accidents.
About what is said "roadcaster company" but not, it probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you're on the road more often in the evening, with several people in the car, you know how a back bench can look like wet nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage are towering there.
There would be a few bags more or less of nothing - unlike the road where no one wants to trample on the food left by others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities are going to be bleak - and the fast food chains have to demand for their bags of bread.
Obama’s Retirement in Health Policy
After severe criticism, President Obama made a retreat yesterday with his often repeated clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.'
After hundreds of thousands of people have received a letter of termination from their insurers, Republicans have recently accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on terminations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus obtain a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government said it was little surprising that the five percent of the population who have signed up for insurance had to change according to a different tariff, since their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: they have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing in front of the House of Representatives' Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been 'misplaceable' since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a raised Sebelius to a consultant behind her sitting at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned the question of why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive a state-funded insurance scheme in order to conclude a tariff for HealthCare.gov itself, which they now want to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force base
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American CNN that Israeli fighters had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
According to CNN, the objective was " rockets and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday on the night of Wednesday and the Israelis were held responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa as well as a battery of SA-3 rockets could be seen, according to Channel 2 having a range of 35 kilometers and carrying warheads of up to 70 kilograms.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We are not commenting on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily that the Syrian regime had already, in part, successfully tried to deliver ground-air missiles to the Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply the Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry states in an unprecedented admission that the U.S. spying was 'unreasonable to go too far'
With an unexpected admission, John Kerry demonstrated that the US's defensive attitude towards its surveillance programmes was "too far away" by saying that the spying was in certain cases "inadequately too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to Autopilot when the explosive disclosures of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the information, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the side of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "The President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so was that which still dates back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 11 September."
He then recognized as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that U.S. spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be compromised.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is keen on killing people, blowing up in the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to disperse concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first democrat to sit in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA recorded millions of phone data in Europe, have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of intelligence said this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult Murphy said that his authority was preparing the visit of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some 'first words'.
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they themselves have been using for years.
"Whether we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," says Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the horror of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury at the jump joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller from using the FSV Mainz 05 FC Augsburg in the Bundesliga outbound game.
Mainz hangs around a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do that individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best goalkeepers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers already have to give up on the injured athletes Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian brings in appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after reporting to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had come safely to her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre on Phuket's edge, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby-Liga, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was 'extremely concerned' about the well-being of his daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course worried, but we hope that she will be back at home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht on the loose.
In Australian reports it was read that she is currently on vacation in the holiday resort Krabi in southern Thailand.
From the court’s side it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could be trying to improve its tourist image after the recent murder of the traveler Michelle Smith in Phuket, and that is why it is a free word.
