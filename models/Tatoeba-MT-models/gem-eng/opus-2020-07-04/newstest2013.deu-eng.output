A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by affirming that electoral fraud in the US is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republican lawyers in the United States, by the way, recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have since 2009 announced new laws which make the registration or urn registration procedure difficult.
According to the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon has gained importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of US citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare the right to register as voters on the election day, and denounce citizens the right to vote for which a court act is required.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities tried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states, which force voters to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million elective persons, do not have a photo identification issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are severely affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
That's enough.
Students who are regarded as voters, who increasingly vote for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards for elections issued by these associations.
No state has requested a proof of citizenship before 2004.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaign for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections helped to register about 10 million citizens.
The number of new voters registered since 2009 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, only 46% of the voters who voted in advance represented the whites, representing 76% of the voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their adherents have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws that require the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of voting rights difficult.
Democratic critics denounce the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have passed these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes that are required in the Electoral Committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows faulty results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater delay of the already undecided men in conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be performed or not?
We have obtained the opinion of two specialist doctors.
The studies carried out in the USA have numerous disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that if no early detection has been performed, the probability of metastasis formation after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already suffered from prostate cancer.
In men of African American origin there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient needs to be made aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options for failure to treat prostate cancer if he does not in the long term impair the quality of life, and in these cases he decides to actively monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men who have known cancer, since their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and to be treated as the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, one determines the criteria for a decision, who should be dealt with and who should not.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out anyway.
Most important, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to do so.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," emphasizes André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unsolved.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It greatly harms the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the withdrawal of cigarettes, the risk of dying cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, intestine, gastrointestinal, oesophageal, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against malignant cancer throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much it increases the risk of suffering from a Grimm or Mastarm cancer.
Herbal products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by incense, drying or salt can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian cancer society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found that the risk of prostate cancer was reduced, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family prejudice.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson Analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused some attention last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "minimum false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not entirely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics conference in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be completely secure about it.
Nevertheless, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of deceiving, and let us look at what it is all about.
In this world there is a necessarily indispensable law, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to be too strong as you will hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them as well: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state", whereby this "state" consists largely of some of its characteristics.
From that point on, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a vicious band of anarchists who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure by the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing), the mesons that we are not dealing with here and the "particles of power" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it has to be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a bison of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
For if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly in this place, in about like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "trails of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disrupted" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the generator must achieve very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be torn by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself in the refrigerator.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon by the way) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good", Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine in detail all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
Incidentally, there are numerous physicists who most sincerely hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One must say that the latter still has great defects, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (against ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed himself the first continuous strip laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was regarded as a "laboratory" at the beginning.
Imagine...
Applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can't really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... - Le Devoir
With its "Death in Dignity" Committee, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate will have to be resumed shortly, although a draft law will be prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important subject area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him for a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've made seven years," he said half-heartedly lying in his bed in the house for the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness makes her work: an inestimable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to be helped with food.
Courageously, he even smiles and talks to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his drugs, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeping in front of us," says Pierre Brodoor, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to the childhood phase is unacceptable for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person", he notes, to take a step backwards.
In the opinion of several people working in the palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them are no longer fond of so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But because of the illness, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that you put on a mask that helps her breathe.
Nevertheless, she expects her son to visit her last visit from Italy in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer with a group of volunteer body care and help in taking food.
Palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little, considering that one day we're all going to die.
Here, life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants the dying person a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetes patients will no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard's Care Director.
Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years of age who enjoys the last family gathering in the farm and is well supported by his pillows while he is at work, a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, his wife, and his two young children, dies tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients less than 45 years old," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who have been admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their home and 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that should alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the local palliative care company in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This great inadequacy in Quebec's health care ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law on the control of death relief and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been signed by prominent Pallativ care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high-quality palliative care is given before accepting death assistance.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had a great pain in the emergency room for 14 days without taking measures to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologens treat their patients bitterly until the last day despite the worst forecasts.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued severe chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I gave up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nurse that it has not allowed this wish after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of Domestic Palliative Care of the Grand Duchy of Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which is aimed at either sporadic or permanent into the patient's death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the possibility to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not eased say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep in me", but "I want my pain to be eased".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Civil servants of the civil engineering office, construction companies, money makers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are involved.
An "industry" which was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system collapses since drastic action has been taken," says Jacques Duchessneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police Department.
The scandal was discovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the misdemeanors in connection with the agreements on road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasises, "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars on the contracts", for some used to slash their instincts in order to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that you will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops on the government's auditors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the police of the "Marteau Troupe" which has since 2009 caused the "Channeling Cartel" of Montreal to proceed with the artificial suspension of the contracts...
Over the past few weeks, she has been conducting series of house searches and has filed accusations about fraud and corruption against municipal mandaters such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting money from the public in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs from Italian origins, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were strongly accused.
The latter has aroused concern by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand in the game all over, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals at the time.
He also agreed to have organised illegal funding for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for sewerage whose costs have been artificially deflated by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially blew.
Other officials of the Road Building Office admitted that they were flattered by artificially blowing up the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking across a shadow budget that filled his cash registers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to construction companies in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in election campaigns
The investigation, which is finally carried out, says that it "draws into a thread that allows it to understand the functioning of the system underfed by ants to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty".
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
However, we are in the process of cleaning the wound, needing only a single investigation unit for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on his part, that "people have stolen several hundred million dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "mandaters, who are in the picture about tactics", if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he whispers: "I was told that this was only a weak call-off of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to 100 dollars of parties, which he says would change nothing about the situation: "As long as election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at throwing a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot of money.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game this is even easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
New arrivals this summer are used to playing very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer forehead and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played at the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust that he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the top rider's seat.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: in this way we qualified for the Eighth Final.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
Everything is possible from now on.
However, we will have our words spoken against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first group in front of Porto, so that we can play the back of the Eighth Final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to repel this title.
We were close last season.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing to do.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that perfectly.
However, if we win 4-0 at a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to accuse us of, that is certainly frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We proved strength in the Champions League.
Take a look at Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the Eighth Final since two seasons, and has also done huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you believed in the game break with 15 points lead!
This said that our opponents and the French championship would be disregarded.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "bought" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and say that despite all the difficulties we have, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much so that you speak of a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the Ligue 1.
Everywhere where he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to take part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from taking out some playing time.
I've seen things out there that I've grown stronger.
Today, I manage to play good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The National Trainer is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "bleus" to Brazil.
On 16 October in Spain, does this forced decision (1:1) constitute an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payment and sale is possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often as possible in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollar, euro, etc.) and a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell to two dollars five months later before he recovered today to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy (and sometimes exchange back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin all net nodes are at the same time depositors of the billing book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can test the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are present throughout the entire network-wide public account account.
The decisive step is to record this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task which is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker who has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and distinct electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole thing gets "cracked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other knots can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred millionths, leaving a certain margin of play...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
"The used vulnerability does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the billing book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "mega lock sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, is pleased to convert Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat states that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered for the benefit of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Incidentally, the ECB's report provides for a re-evaluation of the various risks that are highly regarded today in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to seize the possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the wounded and the destitute.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nirab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflowed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war as a result of the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their seizure of power was then considered a sort of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business makers by confiscating government property to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the struggles.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who have been able to make use of American grants: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are satisfied with the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose command it is held be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will be deprived of the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which had existed since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid for a long time since the 1950s.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country which was destroyed by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been that Afghanistan possessed immense land resources.
This also reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, Institute for French Studies at the Universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was stopped in 2012 in dozens of mountain villages has carried out numerous charitable works and measures for the restoration of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which many local workers were needed, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increases in agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys over 2000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests from the municipalities of Kapisa Province for small agricultural projects.
In order to free the farmers from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which is their wish, according to their own statements, the continuation of lower, well-controlled and directly concerned civil aid would be necessary to their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily granted it the unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this House two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been based on a preliminary text that has been modified several times for almost two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "stepping right with feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to refrain from their intention to explain the text section for section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest rages throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since the Egyptian people are subjected to an ultimatum with this deterrent vote: " Either you agree with my draft or I retain the unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after adoption of the Constitution.
85 largely Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Declaration of Constitution in mid-November, they have turned their backs on the view that they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
Yesterday morning, 11 persons, deputy members, were added to the decision-making capacity.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, since some members of the board thought that the pendulum of the constitutive assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who only consider this to be a blow of propaganda, reply to "no sanctity".
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have considered Article 220, which confers an advisory role on the University of Al-Azhar, in particular as regards the verification of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy in this."
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present there is no concrete religious commitment to be seen.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits, "that there may be a ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are rejected by the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to how far civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament but to a national defence board.
There will also be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as has been demanded by the associations to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy's record is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to comment on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
bowing down to the holy places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the calming of the storm of the sea and fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most shrines, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here enter the Passion Path or Cross Path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here is the Christian view of the Navel of the world, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where a Christian legend says it grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the walls of lamentation, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, there are people of different denominations left with desires that will then be fulfilled.
Traveling to the Heights
The ruins of the Fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in the year 25 AD.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
Everyone else brings a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous Hermon ski area, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly living on the mountaintop.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
In the case of only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among these is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
Old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Judean desert, are kept there as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers then.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops there.
Entrance is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most important department is the monument for the children, which was built in memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Star sparkle.
And it sounds the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel lie on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums at each of the three locations.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore even wears non-swimmer seamlessly on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and salinity as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of damaged nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient History
These secrets are located in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city was the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists enjoy strolling through the narrow streets named after constellations.
Fortuna is said to be the legend of all teams that touch the walls in the alley with their star signs.
In Jaffa you can find newly milled couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Tonight evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is rather not taken in euros, but in dollars that can easily be changed into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper city.
Actually, it's an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs regardless of the means of transport 6 shifts, which is inclusive of switching for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without sheds and foods containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice of different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, fried balls made of powdered beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-nigh cats who stroll comfortably and unholy through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to tasty things.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs an additional 15 dollars a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shifts.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, corresponding to a 51% increase compared to the same period in 2010, prior to the repeal of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens' rights discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with counterfeit certificates.
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families who remained in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force, whereby every migrant worker must pass a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who wish to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail trade.
However, the tests with the time required by the Federal Migration Authority will become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
This requires not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the Examining Office will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of Popular Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to launch the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' lawyers asked the following question several times: What does it actually do?
What changes does the requirement for language skills have to be demonstrated, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, it is about reducing the number of forced workers that spokespersons of the Migration Authority are denied.
"Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representative of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems arise for migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination.
Zebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him under the pretext of help into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure dozens of his like months without food and documents and will be pushed 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised one, and on arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken off and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the administration for labor migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't spit, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only control the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but rather the evil: few Turks, Uskens and Tadschiken can only afford a reasonable primary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school stuff.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights highlight the important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"Welcome to the Heart" or "Prohibit for unauthorizeds"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
Furthermore, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for a thousand and a half.
The Russian police staff know that most of our documents are fake and we are not registered, and then cases of blackmail arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", says Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Don't spare any costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be faked.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: every migrants who hoped to save themselves the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be bought easily, is that both officials and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered places in areas where there is no need for active understanding with people.
Ministry of the Interior Ignores the Illicit Arms Market
Share of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to tighten up the Arms Act for private gun owners.
The authorities thus respond to recent events: injured at shootings at weddings as well as seven dead in the amok race of Moscow jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarrowaja, and promises that the changes to the Arms Act will soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems through "drawing the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published calling on the authorities, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - to distance themselves from "sinless tightenings".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons during the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
At present, according to the authors in Moscow, you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come across several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, the lawkeepers of criminals are stolen.
Baranez explains that these include weapons that were stolen from both the police's arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegal weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover the absence of weapons," says the former military official.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and are therefore squandering arms on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes craftsmanship, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels involved in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Ministry of State Statistics, criminal literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
According to the investigators, the majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all the weapons on the black market were there because of the "indebtedness of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% go back to thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant for a gun shop, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been no longer buying anyone since they are out of date.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get the after-sales in a weapons camp.
A gun, such as a gun of type TT, is purchased via a fenrich.
The weapon is displayed and handed over by the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know all about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, carry out periodic checks on dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers most often find out about acquaintances.
I had seen websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and sign up with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter have lost a tooth".
I'm even going to get some hits on a friend I trust.
He also gives me the hitting rings just because he knows I don't pick him up.
Newbies are looking for weapons on different paths.
The former military man Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album where "all possible" was shown.
"I felt like a luxury shop," recalls the military.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I as a potential customer not only buy, but go with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money", says the advertisement on the website "Buy a fighter gun or rifle".
There, users give up your orders and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorekow".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless false websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the web, and the service is on the web.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shake coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer hands over the money via a cash machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon", reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kisslow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end you can also go out empty and come behind bars when you place an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless false websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the web, and the service is on the web.
"People come as hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to boot coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
In the case of the purchase of illegal firearms, experts are expected to expect prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kisslow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by medium-range supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth is at some point sitting behind the cash register of Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests everywhere in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell, or whether they will soon be airborne.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the protest organizers are pursuing the goal of setting up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA, which attracted millions of customers, sometimes resulting in hand quantities.
On that day, some Walmart employees, out of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and competed with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group are low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart often sells the goods only so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the operating health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars the hour would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart completely changed the pay increases to the customers, in the future each purchase cost them only 46 cents more.
Each year, this would be for them compared to today's extra spending of only $12.39.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that protests were made only in nine states and did not bring any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in its shop from 8 am on Thursday to midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
On "Black Friday", the Walmart boxes carried out nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that in total "less than five" Walmart employees had put down the work and the protest action was merely "another PR trick" of the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was, however, not Walmart (which is not desired in this advanced city and is therefore indistinguishable so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, according to federal and New York legislation, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city deserves less than her.
As it is possible to get to New York with as little money, I am incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the counter after McDonald's school, but the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's employees, I meet people who complain that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal there is a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars the hour, which is more than a doubling of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The US law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and to exhort or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a convention at noon before the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support fast-food workers together so that they can earn a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, many of whom are not all employed in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to see whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"Until now, the brain can only be overlooked"
The theme of the extended reality, which is popular with adherents of modern technologies, is usually perceived by the lens of a special eyeglass.
First, Google presented a functioning model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
In a conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It appeals to the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with mere hands and to create virtual spaces.
- Please briefly describe the research carried out by your group.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, most of mankind has remained stuck in the phase, working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to foresee 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are progressing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect since everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much remains on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also his environment.
Then we could add much easier to the real world through virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this stupid virtual reality helmet!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the universal solution, as it raises privacy issues, because one does not always want to inform everyone around us about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, however, each in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the area of the control of objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and scarce rather than with exhaling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- We'd ask you, for example, to pass this spray bag on you?
They say it, and at the same time they point to it.
- Usually I'll just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what does not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work on the development of new sensor types, which enable us to capture more accurately the reactions of people.
These may be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What demands do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y- but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
Also the speed and number of images per second are important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures in particular.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a regulated processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I just needed one device, just without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of extended reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the way, but I think this is the following: The best version would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch to the smartphone via a cloud of glasses,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (private can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the extended reality as the seventh breakthrough in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure very well!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still so weak as to puff someone over the handballs.
There are also straps for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, including that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to cross the brain?
It makes it feel what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to be believed to be in an open, practically endless space instead; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlooked moderately, and there are many more working years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already arrived on the exquisite list.
Rosbalt's new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the red-dressed beards, who are sometimes found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or at the vernissagen.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and is enchanted by his presence on the street by his fellow citizens a smile in the face and makes them feel good.
A short time ago he grabbed a rotating organ and became a Petersburg filming organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world Red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the gray norm produces aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskiy, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it came "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was only then that I ended.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
And all of this was united in your kind of clinic... it was important to me to be at the heart of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there, up to the renovation work, there was a musical-artist club for Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs on the play-back, wore tight jerseys and among them was the today-so-called composer Igor Wowin.
When the group started playing live, it became part of their Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and that made me get to the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be that way.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the Groteske, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, we saved the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and is oriented toward the outside and not within the human being.
But maybe you can't give a person a hand, but you should spit into his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban turn organ player, a culture city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be nice too?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattery.
We see the decay of cultures.
People used to form large groups: Bohemian people loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that pleases everyone.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- There are several thousand appearances of Stas Michailow.
- Lost women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not destroy the achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that hung with a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumers have no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are necessary.
There are good consultants in Moscow at the moment.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they are blocked because it takes more high-level experts to judge the former correctly and clear the way for them.
Now only one taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters need to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can only grow heavily on our stones.
We need a cultural diet, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's a lot less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Warm up or collapsing with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are no many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"The name Mars and Venus", says the scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
At first, the researchers dealt with the problem of reproduction in the alumni with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants were carried out half a century ago.
The fourth generation of heirs bred in orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (drosophila), in the Orbit.
In 1979, quail was sent to space to investigate the effect of weightlessness on embryo development.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground, the chicks overcame wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely stunned.
The chicks did not respond to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then stopped the whole thing, because it's just impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychew of the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the Orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will contain only identical species.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special has been found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got young.
So far, the problem of reproduction in space could not be solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproduction drive.
In contrast to animals, man could do so in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the biggest risk at Tereschkova.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our Möwe flew off, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Do they survive space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child into the world after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautine, Valentina Tereschkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed works outside the spacecraft, bore a son.
Still, there's a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights to the Orbit", concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravitation.
The hydrolabor in the preparation center of the Cosmonauts is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the Cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; however, infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyanders were testifying that life on the land escaped the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months and that it can then be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just two weeks pass.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While gravity is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the condition of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles grow back enormously quickly and thus also reduce the ability to extort the child.
Well, we'll deal with this through birth-inducing aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to extort the child.
"But what happens then?" is the unimportant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the development, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is fundamental to his life.
"This experiment, which we undertake together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person into the world, a completely inappropriate human being," predicts the director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is just theory.
At some point, however, it becomes reality when the earth dwellers break up into their spaceships into a distant planet that will become the home for their offspring born in space.
NKÚ Head: Control of the Black System Fails by Indebtedness of Politics
In the context of public contracts, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws, but falls back in its application.
In a conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nivyší controlní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is not my opinion of us," Kala comments the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative practical example, he introduces the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODSs would not harass entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the control office, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Chamber of Representatives' Control Committee you spoke about a joint Czech-German project which compared the laws of both countries concerning public contracts.
What was that about?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is about the European legislative setting out how public contracts are to be handled, on which national legislation is based, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "harder and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project?
Such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to achieve the perfection of the laws and the reduction and elimination of thresholds, if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means to acquire one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork", and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems of practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart is the NKÚ of the Bundeskontaktshof, which is similar to ours and also has a college that is only a little different formed. However, in principle, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. there are these accounting offices also in the individual Länder - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds administered to us by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounts offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would only hesitate to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all things.
Is this perhaps because the examiners are better there?
I'm not sure, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the importance of the renewal of the procurement law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this novelle is only in force for a short period of time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
Since our controls are carried out retrospectively, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt more impact in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "recognition of risks of inefficiencies" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an effect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become more "strengthening" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination towards the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are accountable for the fact that any non-compliance with the award law corresponds to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system simply puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us say which path is not a target.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODSs would not brighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then cannot simply come to the head of government, and the control office whose duty is now to control compliance with the law hinders its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only due to formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what we believe is missing.
On the streets there is a single ice surface, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice plains.
Most of the roads are well accessible, but sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible this morning, and snow and ice were isolated.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, and during the day it should become a little warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the ridges of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district guard, the sight of fog was limited.
The R6 motorway and the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third classes, including mountain roads, are accessible.
However, snow remains on these roads in part or in part required or exhausted.
Increased attention is therefore needed in particular in higher levels.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads east Bohemians there is danger due to ice plains, in higher locations, and in the mountains lies on the streets sometimes another skid out snow layer, informs the street and motorway direction on their Internet sites.
The street championships warn drivers of ice plains, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
On ice plains, there can be traffic routes of the second and third classes in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the streets of the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hoy.
An exited snow layer is situated on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or warm today, and it remains largely free from precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it weighs a weak wind.
Pilsen District
Roads in the Pilsen district are now well accessible, but local attention is needed, and the way of travel is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it was snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can be ice-glazed on the streets.
Locally, it is also possible to expect fog, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These data are from the district road masteries.
The D5 motorway is virtually unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by road masters between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The roadways of the first class of roads are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, however, it can come to ice smooth in a cutting way.
The roadways of the second and third road classes are wet and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc District
Today, we have to expect today's snowflakes to ride in the direction of the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snow is left on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drifting forced the roads to be used, in Šumperk district the road administration reportedly fell about 3 cm of new snow.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the Šumperk district, snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo the drivers must expect snow in the direction of Jeseník," said one of Šumperk's road managers today in front of the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to leave at night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest areas, as the lanes are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the street championships report several poorly accessible sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice level, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is blocked according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero, so snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, however, no problems have been reported, and the roads are usually dry.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported especially from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions during the night - rain and melting snow, cloudless sky and frost.
Bad transport conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Kninice was required due to branches that were pushed from the snow to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about taking place in less than a month of the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so love to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more excited about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers a closer look at the project?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya Calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before that, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time that ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us, the Maya calendar.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect sufficient positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which we give this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key holders against the end of the world, with whose purchase via www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world with other performers.
Already today the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, in conclusion, provided that everything works and that the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all performers at the same time at all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from the Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to the collaboration with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is due to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We're trying to involve these people in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us, and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the freeing of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, where we have been working together with the club Tap in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to search the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building of our own will be built into which we will then move with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria did you select these?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support lesbians, Illustratorspher with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we will be performing at the Prague Spring for the first time, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the United States - would like to associate this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these travels logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. Also, of course, we must carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
As a result of your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnesses that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
In contrast to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is travelling alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural to leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to get up against the developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging out with...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation is also dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that even people with severe disabilities can move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the volume The Tap Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to create a band?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intense.
And since I'm a musician myself and I'm playing saxophone, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with time, as our presenter, Láża Angelovič, used to say, something went out of control (laughs).
But the band only got to know in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, as well as starting to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and do not see it outward, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and, among other things, equipment.
Was it your goal to bring it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In the show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in his own way, as everything new is viewed with caution and only after a longer period of time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the audience usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also demand a certain discipline.
I believe that this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to do preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm with many quickly fades.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, that is, since 1998?
Only one: Láża Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome.
Take place on the day before the forecasting end of the world, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues include: Incheba Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected by live mode and it sounds like a common interpretation of the hymn "World Fallout Off" by The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the means for equipping a multifunctional disabled educational centre that will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: 25 million CZK
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance from Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA. Poland is thus the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (according to the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The path of Poland to outer space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space, not always in understanding.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Entry on Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (b. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important champion of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway train was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the Draisin.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated shootings.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that research has been carried out up to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then, of course, interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the technical press of the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon was published by Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakeyobomba lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At the time there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was to be seen that the research of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been instrumental in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first one started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and didn't weigh a total of 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and 1959 began in the Błędów Desert Flight tests with the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further developments were halted.
Following the first rockets of the type RM, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport room with a capacity of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B with a capacity of 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C with a capacity of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
The accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czechist Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit works.
This decision sparked a lively debate in the public sector.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with loose financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
Under this term, it is to be understood that the manufacturer is trying to cope with economic competition through the import of cheap goods by "interfering" competition in order to take a larger market share in itself and to increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move or buy their production abroad, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure is necessarily rising.
This situation is reinforced by the absolute unwillingness of the businessmen to pay their taxes and thereby replace the economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies where governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the private capital dictate, in particular, in terms of wages.
On the one hand, this is caused by economic pressure on long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
In Germany, for a number of years, there have been public food outlets for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of assistants employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all the EU's southern countries will undoubtedly run out to the same state, where people are forced to migrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century), or to present a hunger pay on the margins of society, hoping that some private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theories and media maintain that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy and that planning leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists firmly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy.
Then one has to wonder, though, whether private capital does not influence or even direct the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything is hard, but nothing can be punished.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State mandates private finance, closely linked to industry, to the preparation of legislative proposals.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer based on the people, as Western constitutions proclaim it, but on strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state had long been in decline and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against lubrication money, by unlawful refinement of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unrelentingly, and the people went to the election with already purchased voices" ... "People with character did not recruit for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "One really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was an exclusive rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by exclusive rule.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is founded on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to all social interests.
Private capital is already unable to recognise and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who are not trying to achieve deeper reforms in the least.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Given today's state of affairs, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the past and past history, in total ignorance.
The repeal of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted policy-social reforms that increase the state's share of capital in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus reads: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no war," says the dying Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
One of them stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
At this point I would not like to write about who is responsible in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am concerned to open my eyes to the readers behind the scenes, to see who the 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are especially helpful in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly affects the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every epoch, we can make up a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is whether it was really always these personalities who set their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who was directing their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a particular one emerges, which one could call head of the crack (I don't know if anyone is standing over them, but I'm not closing this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in which background always stood the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not participating in the central banks, they wage wars or equip themselves with them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime subjecting its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay with his life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank, began publishing his own (say: state) banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Mr. Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In 1859 - 1871, the Rothschild's global decree of power led to the formulation of a plan for the release of three world wars by Albert Pik, a Mason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed at eliminating Europe's major monarchist states, the second war in particular should break Britain's colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would ensure their comforts and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the forerunner) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chaos - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises such as the ones triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After having succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of Ferdinand, the Habsburg Successor of the throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsar kingdom through the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer required for the destruction of the Russian czar empire), and then the dissolution of the Central European Grand Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, the bankers had to create a latent conflict situation through politics by making Germany with gigantic war repairs, creating the precondition for impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer up a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-popular state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who should take up the function of a fifth column and also took action to help trigger the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; first clashes with the Arab population based there was.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was now out of the chain of losris, where the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is only hard to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
When international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will be the victims in the front line, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think only of how hard people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, starting with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively voting for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician who is loyal to the international bankers, who is doing everything possible to trigger a war with Iran, which could rapidly expand into a global conflict, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and which, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, could lead to a destruction of the world economy by more than 20% of global oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their vision, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, for he has the mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He who has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of Islamic students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had observed the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow to the call of the united states, and the subsequent Fiasco, in the violent attempt to free the hostages, only made everything worse.
The prisoners were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been negotiated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages called out at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six ambassadors escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them to discover their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film venues in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary.
In order to make it credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret, and the film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This will change the mood levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no big differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood that come ironically and easily overstretched therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the official corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
From a haunted actor, a respectable director has become, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Krivi Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films of this director removed from the Hollywood standard.
But Affleck also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the emasculation of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the feeling of confusion and inescapability that occurs when somewhere moves the story.
A similar effect occurs with his team also in fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality something - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is turned off by a telephone call in America, or the pursuit of persecution on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much of action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood staff, but their characters would have earned more space, so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thus loses a bit of traction. It is a film that you can follow with a certain interest, thus exploiting the design and the retro style reminiscent of a 70th-year-old thriller.
But it is only hard to arouse enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history still alive to this day and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing up balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which issues a yearly survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided to organise the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea brought us the latest plan of the EU to introduce a 40% female quota in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the uniformisation of insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively less risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher announced.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels that are naturally harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazard, or also the directive on the size of chicken cows, because of which eggs have become considerably more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the fact that the use of the term "butter spread" or the prohibition of sales for conventional bulbs was prohibited.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides, under the pressure of this or that lobby of commerce and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also based on the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "plumbing anomaly".
The European Commission defended the argument that it only harmonises the uneven national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be given the warning that children under eight years of age should not blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU called for an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual fairs.
Curiose Accidents There are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated Faire, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, also the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus identified the maximum volume of food supplies that could be found in the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for mushroom canned, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of giving subsidies for applications for grants.
These ideas were obviously not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) Minister of Agriculture at that time in autumn 2004.
As an argument, it argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the State stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally approached the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), should be specifically devoted to the setting up of funding applications for Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations in the Member States are becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts for regulation and thus for the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve more recognition, some experts think.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding money for projects which have nothing at all in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also highlight the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the innkeeper's room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschinken now also includes the Karlsbader Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hoppe.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer can break down or the Hořicer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does one come up with the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would never go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been looted for 20 years, how thieves run around freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate, you made it and then straight on to the castle.
That way, don't you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would be in charge of the President's office if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
However, the difficulty is not only that we, as a people, chimp in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we make everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob you of the honour and who lie the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was told that I would bribe journalists or that I was counsellor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle you have taken in with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective returns of assets of over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population.
As an independent party, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without the idea of drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
It's important to me that we move on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You're wrong if someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this one you would like to approach.
One can call this populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only be left with the key words.
And that's not going to get you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people only long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairmen of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors by law.
And the defendants would have to say, if necessary, why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
With politics, I have just begun and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own; therefore, I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to be able to do so for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to work because of overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in light-oil trade.
My candidacy began with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the electorate did not go to elections at all, and those who have gone chose mostly representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about setting up a party of your own?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZKs.
You don't have any money?
You speak of Declarations of Assets, how does yours look?
I estimate my private assets to about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don't have any money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to blame you?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't get too much interest.
And I am not obliged to contest the campaign by my own means.
The costs for the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live by the senatorial level alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be able to do anything for anything.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to drive back these activities?
But that does not relate to the height of salary.
As promised, I've run back some of my activities.
For example, in spring my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
However, as a president, I would be quite busy doing my business.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - by example of Spikes and the recently built library - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human is going to one of these old-style libraries on a voluntary basis today, right?
Spikes, a hardly need for a visit to the city of sleep in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictitious bridges shown on the Eurolights as beautifully painted concrete miniatures of steel.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistic master: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the top-legged beam diagrams and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with customary serenity and appeared to the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still pampered around and swung with the axles, the cheeky Maas piled up his exquisite charms of size to a pyramid and ended his actionistically substantiated speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So that's my proposal for the Spikeisse library, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain is poured out.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the library was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the sightless town resorts, which so far had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfathomable ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would tend to suspect a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spikenis now has the first public culture building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese bells.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true joys of space and reading are opening up as the topography climbs.
The all-glassed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights are clearly speaking the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already look out for park benches, dog and football playing guys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally, the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space, which is mostly immeasurable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have placed the classic room configuration on the head and stolen the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the library is skillfully used: in the middle there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology centre.
A special joy are the black bookcases, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes armor, sometimes step-by-step countries.
Optics, haptic and smell are foreign.
Even carved architects and construction engineers shake their heads if the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town community Spikenisen, on request of the standard.
And so one day, in a French agricultural operation, we came across an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years a millimetre thin plastic fleece has been used as a root material in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin fabric holds one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulk.
For the library, the nonwovens - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeter thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like a bit of new car and a bit of sport shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long hike you will not only be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and capped ficus trees.
They ensure atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in punkto ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the mountain is under a glass crash, the sun appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden gluebinders, which stand across to the glass facade, serve as shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest of them are fully automatic Rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, had already ventured to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Buchenberg as the "long-overdue soul".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This means that the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled first.
The concept has begun.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for the trifle.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the king's discipline, which is referred to in the Fachjargon Identity Foundation.
Spikes have written literature history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-European relations, Berlin is balancing it to a narrow degree of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin became part of it.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to have a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely changing its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US, as it were, towards a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
The Germans thus find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still involved in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean specifically from the German point of view?
It shows the willingness to obtain positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are at a certain level different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and on voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, into the Arab countries.
It certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight, either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by including itself in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
It may even mean that Germany will take a certain amount of respect.
Because it signals that it has to be taken seriously as an international player and its interests.
There are various opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly expressed its support for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the government under Obama probably has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy at all.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and coherent European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and have to push things out of their own position instead.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position in the future.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role.
Is Germany itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany even want to play a major role?
Or does Germany still find the lead role difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, different anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this respect, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys as long protection as the real names do not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're getting right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm, who specializes in protective violations in Fernost.
Every week a new case ends on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their brands.
So Gucci just makes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, let you record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports item manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in damaged intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively counterfeits.
But the cases of Pattloch are different: on behalf of his clients, he proposes that Chinese companies be given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"That's business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is watered down, the sole attitude disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially for expensive show products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure may go down, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected appeals because after the long duration of the alleged name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff had bad luck, he even had to pay the Plagiator money because he violated his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo dealer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, which made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admitted that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to lack of staff and space facilities.
Last year, however, one returned from "the need situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the existence of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Even so, 81,500 claims are still awaited by the Office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot.
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This was a record and meant that China would be bringing the list of new applications around the world for the tenth time in succession, the Authority will inform.
This also applies to the existence of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
Simple means that each application costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros on average.
On the other hand, the case of the German family company Freudenberg is often the case.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve the extension of its illegal production of imitated motor vehicle parts.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
This has been neglected since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Executive Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munichers.
While Freudenberg got right in the next two instances, the opponent of the process continues to fight to this day.
You have to look out for it.
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely elaborate and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs could hardly be counted, the company archive had to look through even one hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-digit amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost threaten to slip back to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has been abandoned by the Group for a long time, but he was able to refuse registration.
"You have to be obstinate," Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should "registrate in China everything that is somehow worthy of protection", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was left in the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay license fees to the opposite side for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the relevant segment.
Weltaidstag: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tastes - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are happy about it.
The history of a compound that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers are looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the singers' voices slowly wave - old, bass, tenor and soprano - besiege, beguile and pursue.
And Feiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his slippers when he brings them together with his meagerly wild gesture.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes a new song.
To the fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choral voice has another text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to Self-Help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV infected people, who value the United Nations' program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
245,000 orphans live in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godfathers in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser on Zulu.
Speaking fluently in this room, no one can speak the bantu language, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back from time to time, where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
There are 8 733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because they are laying down the HI virus.
In Esitjeni there is evidence in the small part of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune virus in itself, dying in mid-30s is not rare.
During a joint Africa trip in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, you don't have a chance without a school degree.
In the beginning, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which since then has almost professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhö).
Common viral STIs include HIV, Human Papillomaviruses, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filts and herbs belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and trippers occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of the five Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidos (pilz), tripper and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet around 20 percent of HIV new infections are found in this group.
In adolescents, Chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Human papillomaviruses are also common in young people in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
That is about one tenth less than in the year before.
What symptoms suggest a gender disorder?
Infections can cause genital ulcers, urination, effusion, abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide a 100% protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and avoided later.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the Gages, which the choir sings all over Germany, come together a lot.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa manages Dlamini, a self-confident and powerful woman, the money from Germany.
She also cares that the orphans stay well with one of the grandmothers for example.
The Gogos, the name of the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time each day for school lessons.
Anyone who has no longer comes to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obviously the disease in the whole country is also, they are best kept silent.
A King With 14 Wifes
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its extreme lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned life form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, many of which still know from times of apartheid on the southern tip of the black continent.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - not only brings a lot of appreciation, but also has taken a few ferocious border soldiers to tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their foster children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," people say.
And if you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The Messenger Sonde has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA's U.S. Space Administration has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in the specialist magazine "Science".
The Messenger Sonde has found evidence that there is an ice cap in the planet's shadowy region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that have been struck on the Mercury.
No one, however, links the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Sun, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth’s citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who is orbiting the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the Star Circle Room.
This star forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope lace in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has taken up the Nasa lace telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slid out in the dying process.
In the huge Trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
The Nasa Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applicable.
Like a red Age, the Helix Nebel looks towards the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent brought this nebula to North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be absorbed in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the lace telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these were created is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn month that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the coloration, photographs of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the trifid nebula in the constellation shooter, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three parts, tripled), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the starbirth place.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the forebodings of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are rushing to each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have any technical abbreviations, you might call them "Southfire Wheel" by her nickname.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains which are ten to 100 times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientists UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The star cove always produces new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, combined with the rosette nebula, are constantly producing new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from the earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born shortly after the big bang when hydrogen was found mainly in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows eye-to-eye view to be instantly covered with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Advantage of the favorable design: The telescope is locked in its angle of height - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in height angle.
Its special feature is the high light collection power.
This, despite comparatively small diameters of mirrors, is enough for the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear the whole thing after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the main tube can also light out the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is designed to comprise 42 meters - and composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to marvel at an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from the space telescope Hubble provides.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The last boot preparations are documented in the picture at Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 missile in space at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the big bang.
Scientists assume that there is also ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers are much closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is ice on the Mercury.
The Messenger-Sunde, which was launched in 2004, - the first to cross the Mercury - now has the certainty of the scientists.
Drinking butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The trip through the Talysch mountain is called wild-dromant.
The small bus crawls across the curved road, past densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian people's group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town boasts too luxuriant architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the way of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only one-track.
The legendary wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision-Song Festival in May - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talys from the area older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented people who were 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region; in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was supposed to have given birth to another daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov been compulsive at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been heard by the high-ranking people in Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, many very old men live".
However, due to the lack of documentation, there should be no scientific evidence of age, especially since there were no registers of persons.
Every day melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
At present there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why do so many people live here in the south?
The Australian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
But that the calorie-rich diet of the Talys should be so healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem to be plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba lives Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97 she is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls to and fro.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, both longtime grandparents.
Two grandchildren are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical arch-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in garter and limb, under her head cloth she hides long, dark blonde heads, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the post World War II period.
But everything got better than the "Beloved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation that ruled its country as a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the row.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's elderly.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, an amount that can be well lived for local conditions.
And maybe Mirzayeva's long-grown son is right: "The old people enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing rallyes in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with the Sharia as a basis is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For they all, so far hopelessly disputing in a confounded opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He has, said Muhammad Mursi, almost apologies, temporarily cut the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California really wants to save, the Egyptians are not quite clear about it.
Whether the sidebar includes a builtin shortcut to the Desktop folder
In fact, the 234 articles, which were peered through by the Islamic-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a 15-hour morning parforceritt, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what is "principles"?
That was and is the point of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the smug wording and the resulting legal margin for a more rigorous interpretation of Sharia.
This suggests at least one new article added: in all the Sharia matters, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiance in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy supervise legislation, which in fact would result in the discharge of the Judicative.
A great deal in the draft text is the interpretation of the text.
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionals.
Following the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "protect the true being of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values".
This is legally so harsh that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the plain text, that means nothing but censorship.
Incidentally, no article specifically states the equality of men and women.
For this purpose another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Likewise dubios encourages the formulation that the "insultation of people" is forbidden.
Is there enough of the President's cartoon or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Mursi has for the signature and, according to his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been shaping itself against the power of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening on the Tahir Square in Cairo and promised to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed Presidential Elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winners and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belonged to "the Müller of History".
Through short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of wanting to lead a "punch against democracy".
"If he cries out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said the oppositionary Jasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet wasted," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood bles its way to the field demonstration, but be careful not on the Tahir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Nilefer in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried out, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi: "Peace the land!" and begged, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have encouraged civil war-like states.
Clearly, Mursis' followers didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide which way the country should go.
A majority for the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone up to February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, convicted, arrested for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resigned.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President put it out of action de facto," Saeda laments.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, which looks at the ideological directional struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be the cause.
A protester on the Tahir warns: "You're bringing a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite on rather smelly fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave her there for a week.
So about you have to imagine the wet-suffering smell of Rakfis, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fnessen, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how stinking one would like its fish - is fermented into water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Füssen, which is dedicated to this, now, really great speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfiss General".
People around us consume little fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfis," says Havard.
The spirits can exhale the smell.
I'll get some chickens.
If you avoid bringing Rakfis close to your nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a rather long bus ride behind him.
Rakfis is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drunk in autumn in airtight saltwater barrels.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the aid of alcohol suppressed senses.
Even before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not too much richer than Norway, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists, the last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, you only refer to the "accident of 22 July".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peaceful land is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the main responsibility for the wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rake fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and the steadily blue eyes.
We are a caring people, as they say.
Your English is just like most people here flawless.
We're not very greedy, we don't like bragging.
Norway has dealt very carefully with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's contracts are invested for the good of future generations in a special fund.
In the years leading up to the world economic crisis, when all of them threw around with money that they didn't own at all, Norway held its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And, of course, eat Rakfis", she adds with a smile.
I stand in the snow and stand before another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I log in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster lined with flies, surrounded by plates with rake fish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What do you have points up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Haverd."
You talk and you laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his entry into office, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is always a blocked city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that locks off several important routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will be elected president and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under Felipe Calderon's segregated government, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is very committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A Direct Man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you can remember him.
Residents of the resort ascribe to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement over the bustling, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Placards with its name are also hanging outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressor for Pena Nietos, the PRI Party.
In particular, as far as security and economics are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nito.
The accusations of opposition, the new president, lack substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has great plans for the country.
He was an excellent statesman, but he was also one who could listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was set up to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a spot of Brachland near a large garbage dump alone in the last two years.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic which even surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics, Pena Nietos, consider that he did not adequately address the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the settled neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her lifemate.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been deployed.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is mounted next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But just these, according to the family, they have been denied her so far.
The authorities have treated me as a sweater, troublemaker, nörglerin.
They want you to just accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many formal errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's tie on Saturday, he will assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes in the last six years, and the new President has promised to deal with this problem in particular during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is the same as he was as Governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But exactly before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza feared most.
The prosecutors claim: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he's been abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The United States Army's freedom is accused of using thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutors tried on Friday to find out that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in American history - failed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland told Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits had not been filed by prison officials during the nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of an application for defence to reject the charge - Manning had already been adequately punished by the hard prison period - Manning had announced that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army secret service analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
During the hearing on Friday, Mr Manning carried out the forms that officials had completed after their meetings with Manning during his detention at the Quantico Military Prison, where he had been in prison from July 2010 to April 2011 under reinforced conditions of detention.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When finely asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, says Fine, did not contain complaints about maltreatment, although officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote up "no problems" (after consideration) and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal idea he mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to degrade his observation status for "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it had assigned to him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the threat of suicide - and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for preventing injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning announced on Thursday that he was arrested and relocated to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Do not know what happened to him or to the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and couldn't see his face anymore, he was raised to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also questioned about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning counting.
Manning had announced that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his ceiling during this counting.
At the Friday survey, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had announced that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the bundle of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention rate, should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be guilty of less crimes, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the detention conditions.
The Pentagon shall remain in its position to hold Manning in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept under the highest security conditions in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include the favor of the enemy, unlawful disclosure of classified information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants - they call them heavy times to mind, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when impunity spread in me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicans", another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of what to go to.
I grew up in central California and was called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Ire" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to be Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for accelerators or ties.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans are likely to remain in Mexico today, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wanted to associate himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States would fall into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country, under the military, to leave them with more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official uses only the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans suppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about ressentiments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for which the country offers opportunities, and others for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people live Mexican origins in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents - got no chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-headed, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the American dream that we are living - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when a child legally immigrated to the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans take this from them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling that they belong neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in it.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexican.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to resume their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "messenger" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well.
It won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, the unbridled corruption and the violence of drugs, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to give the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grip on how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're Mexican, when I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were struck.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these confusions.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to believe that the deadly path situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21st continues, this week's battles have strengthened the hard-dead on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claimed to have forced the Israelis back, even though its grouping itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are infested in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, so far Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining control of the rival Palestinian group Fatah in the West Bank.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resilient regional power once regarded as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken over for the Hamas party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Jealous Hamas supporters believe that around Israel there is an Islamic half moon - from Lebanon to the north, where militant Hisbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic embodiment could stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the layman despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot even be pushed out of Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States firmly holds its position, and many European countries have held Hamas responsible for the latest violent escalations.
Israel has done well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have been killing some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the lock-up facilities that have flowed into the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal by international law, but are being expanded ever further.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party was united with an even more militant group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians also stifle and leave them a state of their own?
If they really had control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles just like their rivals in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to enforce, but the Arab Spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense set is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic president of Mursi met with Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israelis too should think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking delicate steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powdered barrel that will one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only aggravate this situation.
Bloody missions to suppress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an introduction from outside
The correct answer is those who are represented by the more rational representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states where Israel is leaving for security.
The hope - for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by exchange of territory and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama too must contribute to bringing Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems that it would be equally averse to a participation.
But that is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and affected body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green lids, printed with drastic pictures showing sick body parts and cigarette smoking infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small type will be made on Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent regulations for tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government expects studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 will not start with 99% probability even after that.
"You can already see with children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," states Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have scrambled their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies had failed to comply with the laws, the demand for cigarette and silicone caps to cover the unbearable packaging has increased enormously.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units of wholesale trade and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with exactly the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, forced them to act as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to no longer interpret cigarettes in shops. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in health care at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "quite normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even has a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is concentrating on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions at the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries trade with Australia in a larger way.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001 to provide photographic warnings.
They are now extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves to be defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring her.
"You just take a tip and put away the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Frankly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made filling up his shelves difficult.
"I used an hour earlier to sort out a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he clearly adds.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored even times
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane came out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to get a few thoughts into boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought walks, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we therefore welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that once again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompeiis adorn a Latin graffiti over boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom was the experience of wanting to "exercise a satisfying activity, but not being able to do so".
Thus, boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that time is passing only slowly".
This can make boredom almost as appealing as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions might be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even if we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The Inactivity: The Definition of Langeweile under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which the participant listened to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring space that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said that they felt more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could find no reason for them and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do one-day activity - "just like looking for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that rums and crutches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping more physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a loud speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people are more bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scala for boredom vulnerability" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements such as "Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys become more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external charms.
But in general, teenagers are a rather clumsy bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted a pager seven to eight times a day with almost 400 teenagers and her parents.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and doing homework were bored, whereas 23% reported being bored if they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents claimed to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he was sure that "youth is felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes it doesn't, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into the game of gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that's what studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that something else should be done," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you are boring and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
However, television can cause happiness in the short term, but it is a long-term fugitive.
Thus, if you pass an iPad to your bored child, you can get rid of the boredom. However, it has not been learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self control is transferred from one situation to another".
Not only does the child learn to talk but he also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to make us feel at ease with regard to the continuous implementation of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be bored more often. But boredom is the wretched, unbearable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is overshadowed."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and footballer Anthony Orozco stands for a trial in southeast Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few fewer marijuana fractions and a pipe with which he smoked these.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on their way on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was charged for possession of drugs and narcotic drugs - cavalry charges, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offenders depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of procedural errors surrounding marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years of age for small-scale possession. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to pursue existing marijuana prosecutions and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new government-licensed marijuana shops from opening up their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and are looking forward to a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of the regulation of marijuana. There, the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spirits in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how to agree on the state requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of 300-metre cannabis business around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Somewhere it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's conurbation area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijuana offenders in people over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal prosecutions for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban regulations for medical marijuana farmers and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stronger view.
After the vote he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdrawal.
At present, 119 persons must be held in court for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute crimes involving crime at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are bleak even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership procedures.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile Marihuana's personal consumption with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a deep division among local officials in terms of the great green experiment.
In the case of District Attorneys, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, representing the accused of marijuana and acting on-site as spokesman for the national organisation for reforming marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people with criminal law that they are still unable to accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national samples for the legalisation of drugs.
While proponents and state officials prepare for legal sale at an age, they also wait nervously for instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Proponents of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several spectacular arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama-Government drug policy consultant, believes that although criminals are not likely to enter doors to confiscate smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to be stunned to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved moratoria for new marijuana businesses, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We aim at what the community has chosen and not for what the state has decided.
Many questions remain open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the largest knowledge mark in the world, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I had gone because I had a problem with comets having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I'm running away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for a reason - a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an important consultant to Margaret Thatcher and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer similar persecution.
Organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded equal rights protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They demand a place on the Equality Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recently radiated documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as eccentric and Neonazis.
This was shown, among other things, by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who drove in a roller-Royce, prodding with silver suit and silver-coated heel.
At other universities conservative students say they are regarded as "sunbooks for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "uncomfortable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she had observed growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred for the Conservative party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to give an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I received a taste for the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mocking of Tory students, but even joyfully participated in it.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden vaulted rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been made up of what was then to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stumbled.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Does thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students looked.
Tears came up in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French hours during your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt added.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That night I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone tipped me easily on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who presented himself as a member of the conservative student union.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory will be marginalized.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to change my mind.
I insisted that I wasn't in all respects with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics and economy, who ironically attended Eton College, which is a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Torie's sex?" one asked me.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel in front of the more liberal United States legislation.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me extended to a purgatory of fear and isolation in front of my spiritual eye.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had consulted Thatcher on foreign policy and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small-caliber and rejected him for his Marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he received a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends always showed flawless manners.
His wet eyes choked.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure they're just gonna fuck you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During one tutorial the next week, when another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I went secretly to Shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to brainwashing, and called her "old fool".
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father who beat the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hares gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd like you to call me a baby cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and atrocity.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory prime ministers but still hide behind an undeserved reputation of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the staunch and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be to be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, across the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be disadvantageous.
"At least they don't drop their chickens on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We're all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a Valentino dress
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the fashion maker's charisma.
Many years ago we went to his home for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and his influence was felt.
"All those invited felt important and loved", remembers the "Top Model" which began their career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art" she concludes.
Modenshow of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessiveness, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long walkway that proposes a roll change: the user takes the space of the model and goes along the walkway to admire a dreamlike "audienz" wearing masterpieces by Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls are the names of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the Autumn/Winter collection 1971-72.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' museums.
"I attract him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-daughter of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at the Fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamt of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains these Italian aristocracys, which live between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg preserves her fashionmaker's evening dress "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress but also the related memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his nearers) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre-long float.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoire-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the honor legion, brings Garavani as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"I've always noticed his refinement, his peace, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no traces of him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by bringing sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to climb down to the ground of its crater every day, where the sulphurous gas coming out of the earth is fastened in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them to two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the sloping paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises up to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle tempo, where they need to maintain the balance and take their steps carefully so that they do not slip out and fall off.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as a French tourist did, who fell on the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The mineworkers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Euro cents for each kilo of sulfur they degrade.
At the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the presence in the volcano and (not to say better) his workers, for whom they pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we receive approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is fully accomplished, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort, but is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the bearer who previously worked as a waller on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 Euro) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first marks on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are soaked out of the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he must pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a tragedy.
It divides a dirty wooden cottage with other supports and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the darkness.
Challengeing the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers charge the basket with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) supplement per camera that the guards of this natural park, along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro), require of the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" protests Madrusin, a regular 42-year-old carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes", because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes are itching when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur out of the volcano, which is transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder with his 30 years also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation on generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: the one who works as a human vice at the Kawah.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singapore's fault is that they have no children, the career, the stress and the costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Do we fulfil our citizenship and create life!
It seems unlikely that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbons, but nevertheless - or for that very reason - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "shooting becomes a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to joke about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, is true of the hope that the advertising spot will reach the attention of the problem in a funny way.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we grow, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or the organization of speed dating dinners (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants up to $15,000 per child for couples and parents, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything so far had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech urban state in south-east Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the national government's marriage and family policy, says that this is due to a "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have far more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities, except to get married and make a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely castrated Xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result last year since independence.
Since the elections an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Expected consequences
While the drop in birth rates has a well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shush boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they discourage the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new norms give the developers clearer orientations that were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in national birth rates, discussions with the Singaporeans working in the financial district must be seen as having no major impact.
"People are very stressed, the homes and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, stress and costs of property and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - that is why the government can do so much more.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" at personal level and "to the password and user" when they used it on social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked, criminal, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up at Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just load them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone were to recommend a stranger to him, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has attached to his friend list.
"This doesn't scare me because we have something bad, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one made any suggestions or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harasss me or asks me to remove it from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown about experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's friend was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He only made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unsympathetic to me or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and young people must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform them.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; but with the publication of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a Master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who should teach them, where we still learn ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion on what may be published, published or said, and this at an age when maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be electorate when it is most important to them to be popular with thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people is to ask them privacy questions that make them think about.
"You tell them not to do it," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo published by you, like the one you published by a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Have you ever asked the other people for permission before, when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: does everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they must act online as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educator, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read out the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you may share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically to be signed by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Court initially announced that they would hand it over after the clause, but then explained that it would be published at some point on the Peruvian government website.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the Presidential Meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the announcement "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur that were present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort to hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
The Presidential Office of Peru then sent the media an e-mail with the "declaration" of the summit meeting, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document at the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host to the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the strong appeal of the press, the so-called Declaration of Lima, previously announced, was also not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague to settle a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which began on Monday in The Hague, in the process of listening to the pleas of both sides, the Lima against Santiago.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently making to this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, and remains, a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, enters into agreements and subjugates the international courts," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they were subject to the IGH, after Colombia had filed a serious error in bringing an action against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, in which it was agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, from Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, from Bolivia, Evo Morales, and from Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The Head of State reads the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
He said to the decisions taken that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be pursued to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban and organised transnational crime, and measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on a triumphant course, but should serve to expand our production capacity and to show our people a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects designed to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read explanation.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian, located on the cross-axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and of which two should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasised at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting, that on Saturday he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to deal respectfully with the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega on the morning (Saturday), said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Minister of Defence of the Block met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which took place in Lima, explained to state television in Peru that the Europeans were "killing themselves in World War II and in other conflicts" and "now practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had lived up to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "founded assumptions that Assange would deliver to a third country and that his procedure would not be respected."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, who had asked him to interrogate him on his territory for a alleged sexual act, while "the Swedish case law allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been conducted on the Ecuador Embassy in London."
Correa stated that the risk was that Assange’s health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious problem," said the head of the state of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he might take physical and mental damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum that Assange had been granted since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London was the granting of a free letter, with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads a number of procedures to various European authorities," he said.
And "if the UK grants this letter tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuador Embassy in London or about Skype, as the Swedish jurisprudence has been allowed and in other cases the problem has been solved.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lies that disfellowship freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and extort profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador no longer "and not be dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spy-bourgeois countries" and anticipated that, in a re-election, "he will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain firm and not allow opportunism and no legalised state rule" because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate the maritime borders between the two countries with Nicaragua, for "absolutely entitled."
This judgment is not being implemented at the moment.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need comprehensive treatment so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also trusted in the good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he may stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he allowed the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under as unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must shoulder this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"It's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to dealing with the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone for a scheduled, routine treatment there, and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In no case does it mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
Today, the Head of the ecuadoran State took part in Lima's 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of Death because of AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the results of the study were confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor ' tried to weaken' without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
At that time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, which knows nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already done harm and has exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG's HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information had been based on a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent are: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive the HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "be easily 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to properly arrange this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNUSIDA Annual Report)), it is nevertheless true that since AIDS appeared, 60 percent of the patients included in the national database have died.
Alone in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
So why do people still die?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the care of the medicines. The problem is that the people come in advanced condition because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, so all persons in whom this is required have to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estate de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State AIDS Prevention Committee in Jalisco) and also by the patients such as Fabrizio who conducted his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather kick it three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the drugs.
Today, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," adds Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animated with his testimony those today who are afraid of the world AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen there are large holes, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"Where do you need it?" is a common question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, staff in pharmacies and in the health system that young people do not want to be exposed, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; condoms should be located not only behind the shop table, but in equipment in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether or not preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located in 4th place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the appeal court of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities reached through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an unwholesome precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has had payment problems.
It could be said, then, that in the country of stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements, the procedures for the survival of companies which are permitted by the Mexican laws do not have validity.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas leads the Mexican companies to be subjected to seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo hilflos.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for insolvency of companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
To this end, the United Nations Model Law was created for the unification of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being used as a simplification.
Second, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro's branches with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Bankruptcy).
It is also right that after deduction of the votes of the branches the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who appealed to the United States courts against Vitro, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote would have taken 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family opposes the same appeal court in order to vote in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not allowed, the Cerciorare case, which calls for the review of the case by a higher authority, will be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States.
The main thing in this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figure amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Bankruptcy and states that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the Commission of the United Nations on International Trade, i.e. the established rules on the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Avadores (Federal Association of Workers) has finally made progress.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal trial against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the bank IXE trust account F/589 on the name of Mexico de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front in order to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the South-East to oppose the monumental establishment, which partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has not been complied with, the matter has already been archived in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility of considering them as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex will place on the market certificates over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that an interest payment promises every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Established by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies called Competival has been set up, the aim of which is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world’s boomer of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, agent and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"I spent my life in basketball, even several hats at the same time as I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalls when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of Vaqueros since 1967 as managing director, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I took a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throwing specialist Raymond Gausse, who allowed himself to become a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, he would take care of another one.
The championship of Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already in the highest position of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre- Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, in which we finished fourth place, which was supposed to be bronze, if not this Canadian referee, who had us repeat the last turn for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as are those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as at the time when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
The team included not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quiyote" Morales, who could not attend for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that might not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre- Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculin.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the union?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I had introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the guys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always at my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R. in the TV series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, homely and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who this year came back as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved city of birth, Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that pleased him most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Thanksgiving Festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone happy who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he was undergoing transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known as a nice guy on television in 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Be charming Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is set on his head when he meets an attractive "Dinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor of two comedies, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting abominable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of CBS television series on the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R.?", which was expected to create an episode full of emotions where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bets in bethouses.
The show thus reached a spectator record in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had her swinging and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: an insidious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to say on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "normal personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success in the TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just shot, informed the transmitter.
There was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann in the series would be treated by Warner or TNT.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theatre courts in the early 1950s, then served in the British Air Forces from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolute True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything about which I thought it might harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press of the time.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donors and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "not afraid, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course, which studies the "end of the world"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the Maya calendar's "long backward count" on December 21st, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some called "Deudar Maggedon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever" said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry Facker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas are spreading over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could erupt.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We do not take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to hold the course again, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State the final exam is carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance than "to continue until night, where the world is said to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his high-average course for students who filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places available.
The students, on the other hand, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectial or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard anything from a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less one professor - explained that they believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of the Maya, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeilen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"There are other places where people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world", he wrote in response to an exception to a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken from the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'm calling some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
