Politicians in Wales afraid to "like fools"
There was horror among certain members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could give rise to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal leap from MWP to Muppet (feel).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legislative proposal on the introduction of the name changes, said: "The final decision on names that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to Members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve consensus may prove difficult for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The draft reform contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly is working, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call when the bill is debated.
Macedonians shall vote on the change in the name of the country.
Voters vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade's dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a requirement on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, is opposed to the vote and says that he will be voting in favour of it.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is merely a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches in Harlem are fighting
"The older people I spoke to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money collected to sell assets does not last long and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the repatriation of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he says, "and it blows further to the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the properties will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was leading a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, which would not employ or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played at the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been going on in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been caught up by church leaders, others by the bishopdom.
In July, the assembly council – the so-called governing body, which consists of leading laymen – wrote to the bishop's council of bishops on concerns that the bishop's "would try to push spending forward" to the council of the congregation, even though the council of the congregation had not been involved in recruiting the architects and contractors sent in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopship.
Shark damage 13-year-old on diving after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"All his clap was ripped up," said Hammel, looking at him when he came to the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
I don't know what kind of shark attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the line from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours of security and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take over the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of stormagasins.
As part of a great effort to take over the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products are falling.The larger ranges of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products is taking place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves used in the past for television, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches a range of Boutique makeup, so that most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop tests the perfume store living in two Sainsbury's shops. The first one opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a development against buying small amounts of food daily from local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like stormagasins, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily products and have made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the cooperation ended with a fight about how the profits of the pharmacists in the supermarkets were to be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decor of our range of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our range of fires is designed to suit all needs and the consuming environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "racial", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left "racial", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "rare", when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly, while Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project for which she should deal with the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the report from this Morning host, which is among Britain's stars with the highest earnings, could cost the company several million because of large investments in products – ranging from powder to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can also end up in a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples spend vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby must be a brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as a host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business actions."
Hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made a joke about the criticism he would get from the news media in order to make a comment that is "not worthy of a president" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a newsword.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting after Trump proclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial response to disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure going.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his election meeting.
" North Korea is doing very well," he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – completion of rocket tests, aid with the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It's so easy to act stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island and kill several hundred
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were left homeless, no state of emergency was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children composes a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster preparedness, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, it is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
There are built tsunami refuges in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but apparently there was a lack of a tsunami and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued with lack of funding as the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge is looking up at Chelsea in the last minute
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a scoring in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was back with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot at the farthest pole.
The ball flew high over the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just about getting into the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq always trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came, and I made a single touch. I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker delivered the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he stepped up the middle track and sprinted into Liverpool's runway half.
Kovacic made a quick one-to-two on the middle track.
He then made a long episode that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and finished towards the farthest pole with a shot with the left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights for Naples in the Champions League group game at 15 Wednesday at the Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death rate from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunamis has risen to 832 reports the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many prisoners were reported in the masonry from buildings that fell after the earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man of 32 under suspicion of murder, after woman is daggerd to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man being arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police have called on people in the area who saw or heard something about coming up.

I would also like to call on everyone, especially tax collectors, who may have taken up something with Dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that might be crucial to the investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police state that they are informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but is told by the police that no one should enter the building.
He was paralyzed when he heard what had happened.
Citizens are now being told that hours are going by before they can get back in.
A police officer was overheard of telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps repeating, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another car outside.
A number of police officers were in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment complex.
All with information please write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and inform log 247 on 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the last memorial to be struck by discussion on 'rewriting history'.
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were carried out by his fanatical, puritanic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for his forefather Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it is worth tribute.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact image is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is quite certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing the one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth saluting and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, identified only under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overburdened pulsar and bruised in blood near a grisesti on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farm is preparing to give pig injections of vaccines for pig farms on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
He had allegedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning, the cousin found him dead and found a door to the pig house next to it was open.
He said there was a big bugger with blood in his mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and hurt," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't part of Yuan or his cousin.
One market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others, while the police are collecting evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there are previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg must have a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife, scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pig usually is not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
The nappers, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the South West USA
As foreseen, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will rain with floods in northern Mexico and southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had won 38 m/s, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure outlet across the Pacific, moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California Monday as a tropical storm, it begins pushing tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure outlet that comes closer and generate strong rain in the south-west United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating rainfall and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will produce rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the South West United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the spread of tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is danger of tropical rain.
Powerful rain can transform the cliffs into bubbling rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dust blowing.</seg>
The low - pressure drain approaching will produce heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which may result in less amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in its rainy season.
Spreading tropical rainstorms will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and widen out more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continues Wednesday.
In October there can be a large temperature fluctuation throughout the United States as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains fairly hot in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast areas.</seg>
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is great likelihood of temperatures above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's catchy testimony from the nominee to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political battle continued with stations that interrupted the general programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judgment committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in drunken condition was moaning at her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company recorded average serum readings at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately available ratings from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a number that corresponds to a struggle under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose pollinators strongly backed up on the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interests remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a declaration that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the judgment committee.
He stood with a downward look for several minutes while he was being scolded, and CNN sent live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All the TV stations covered live hours later when the judicial committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the next week, as the democrats who are in the subtotals of the Senate had asked.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister accuses critics of "legitimising" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU in order to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs was "right through ridiculous".
Shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson who is suspected to be behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent manslaughter, said the Baton Rouge police.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said that he had admitted the shooting of Wayde.
His bail is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The lawyer in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
Police Department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police department, police from Southern University and citizens of the area have assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports manager at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said the team is "fucking" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's the kind of thing you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano vomits ashes over Mexico City
Ashes spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The national disaster prevention centre warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity arose in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded during 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumbles and tremors over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale, shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, following demonstrators who want independence, met with rioters as several thousand participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on release.
A group of masked separatists stopped alarmists, threw powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also fights later in the day when the police used their spells to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with Unionist demonstrators who shouted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The vote will continue to be high in the region of independence one year after the vote of 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electoral union was low, and those who opposed the release boycotted the vote in great style.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at voting locations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night before Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held but forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy at having the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or are in detention awaiting judgment on their role in the holding of the vote and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There's going to be bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would stand up for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The establishment as a candidate in European elections is the best way to reject the setback in democratic values and the undermining we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 are arrested, after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday about 19.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also be that an armbrush was fired against the car at some point.
Menga's Shot Gives Livingston Victory of 1-0 Over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston ensured victory
The impressions of Livingston overshadowed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league this season and must meet the leading team Hearts, as they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be visiting Rapid Vienna in the Europe League on Thursday.
In return, Livingstone is expanding their undefeated stripe to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt still hasn't had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash spending
Holt's team should have been in front of a long time before they scored, and their direct play style created great problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed over across the front of the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transverse header in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could cause persistent problems in death-ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers went to Frispark, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created together the mission to Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but had struggled to get through the home team's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually unchallenged.
The pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was guarded off with the feet of Rangers target Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingstone's deathball situations.
There were continuous deliveries into the Livingstone field, but were prevented, and two demands for a penal park – after Halkett's tackle on the replacement Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal effort and strong result for Livingston.
All played fantastic and exceeded expectations on their upward journey.
Their playing style and trump are virtually unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped on.
There were a lot of heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the game.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played below the level.
Their closures lacked sharpness – only once they got naked homehold – and this is a bad awakening for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement over areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new big mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held for security reasons a crowd of 25,000 from getting together in front of the mosque, but lots of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German Government’s decision to accept them.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat of others.
Accidents on the way to Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled from the site, on Childrens Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
Road closures have been set up, bus routes have been changed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers have been injured in a state of unrest in a high security prison, according to Prison Office.
Unrest arose in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at about 9.30 B.C.E. Sunday, and the turmoil is still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been picked up to handle the riots involving eight inmates and taking place in one wing of prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are employed to deal with the ongoing disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, rioters were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (dry areas can take advantage)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely in the early part of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa are moving across the desert landscape in the south-west of the United States, creating the risk of a storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings of storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-west desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside of the risk of storm tide, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the south-west United States is currently experiencing drought.</seg>
According to the American drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category", reportsweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on Baja California peninsula in Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning with maximum wind power of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain on parts of Mexico can become strong and give high risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora with an option of up to 254 mm," reportedweather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert region of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and floating falls in the deserts as well as landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on all those who may have mobile recordings of the events to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was the subject of the democratic party's "badness and anger"
"A vote on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony in front of the Congress on Thursday and strongly denied and emotionally charged accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he had been sexually abused for her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave testimony at the hearing on his charges.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the skill, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains in our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks there is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I go around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are out on a mission to "dispute and block".
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person highly placed in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths of Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis, the death rate is growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, state authorities Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at the time of foaming, sucked many in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in beach activities. They did not immediately run and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster preparedness GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunamien did not come alone, the towed cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published air photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Submissions continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was marked in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Board of Directors for the Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released during Friday's major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was dropped over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "concealing" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and 29 reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and the damage could be greater along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was paralysed without information" by Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There live over 300,000 here," said the Red Cross in an announcement, adding that their employees and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
On Saturday, the board was criticized from many fronts not to mention that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time when the warning was issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings about tsunamis coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power failure that cut the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo aircraft with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but food and basic necessities are still urgently needed among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarmacs that are set up in the courtyard of their account. They passed areas with extensive damage on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief organisations began to work again in the field of relief work, complaints came to the effect that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and employees from abroad must enter only if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster' we can open up for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held fast in the hope that their immediate ones would be the miracles that brighten the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were captured at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandigi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how in the hours, after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who attended the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray flute instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Thieves take $26.750 in cash machine filling in Newport on the Livee
Thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's employee who was fulfilling a ATM in Newport on the Livee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "back at Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All with information about the identity of the thieves, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
The name is a abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also changed between small and large letters and changed whether or not binding lines are included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country is approaching 50 years for a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements were raging in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research within the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government has reported on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced its plan last year and aims to take the lead in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next great achievement in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's department in China.
Lee recognised previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge, which was held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionaries could be identified.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to obtain gifts from the government, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should have offered work permits automatically.
China's State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations' distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF currently invests over USD 100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation that attempts to set up a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has stood still for several months.
Macedonians shall vote on the change in the name of the country.
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on whether their country's name should be changed to the "North Macedonia Republic", an initiative that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a requirement on Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has sought membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the mainly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electorate will represent the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot box was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price that is worth providing access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more safe lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and do so.
The name change would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The election commission of the State said that there were no irregularities reported at 13 o'clock.
However, the voting attendance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the name of the country that would open up NATO and EU membership in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to achieve membership with raised panda, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a heavily needed investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour because over 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving their vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "assuring our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the voting required.
Another poll by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV indicated that 57 per cent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Out of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took place in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack received a midway delivery at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed three Brighton props before he swung out on the open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart the Brighton target Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," told the City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about him playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League match.
That target came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice episode along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues forward was plucking the ball in the net just before it slipped past goals.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the group game in the Champions League at 12.55 Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drink Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a chance to participate in the playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least stuck in a wild-card space with a 5-2-victory over National's Friday night, but still have their first division title for good.
"Even if we have nothing to play for, we can go to the game well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the probably highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals has not yet signed out the start-up until Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the plet for 34th time, trained his throw Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hand player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings during this season.
Trump holds election meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republicans meeting in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
That's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all available means. You can see how wicked, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're hurting who they're going to drive to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have, as a mission, "disputed and blocked".
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, "and you have called the Democrats "peaceful and evil and disgusting and lying."
He referred to the highest democratic senator in the Senate’s judgmental committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered loud noise from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, wait just – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our views known.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was given a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship was about to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
Compared to the importance of responsible economic policies, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically, similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local MEP, Friday evening meetings have just been like this.
Today, the tone of many meetings is unfortunately not that way, and the promise of a more "friendly, gentler" policy lies far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighted to see whether the leadership of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues, whom I once thought I shared a political stance, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the European Union's internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – I follow a long-striped rough message on the social media that calls for the rejection and contradiction of the middle-scanning policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the will to fight with those colleagues who, every day with sexism or racism, are still fighting on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normal level of abuse.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was going to create a tolerant culture.
But in reality it is no longer a spatial organization and with every motion of censure or change the rules of selection the party becomes narrower.
I've been given plenty of advice over the past two years that if I lay low on myself and I'm not so loud, then I'm going to "still be fine."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in a fallow state, and I sat down to provide better public services to those who need it most – whether it was a city councillor or minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in my last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and differences with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country turns forward to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of disqualification or political fitness will prevent me from acting on the basis of what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr becomes top team
Two late Scorings may have made the final result of drawing a not entirely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory of this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was as much their superior defenses as their better use of the opportunity that carried home, and coach Peter Murchie had absolute right to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penal park just before semi-legged. He scored and then got a solo coring, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, which was followed up by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out on the track on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent kick from Climo.
Running Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and once again Melrose exploited their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without subsequent kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the future Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the poles and followed up with a more almost straight after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flute player Gregor Henry off to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game star looking for new careers in the restoration industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran looks to take the step to the restoration industry, after it appeared that he has taken the directorship of an authorised restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series that he writes and is the main person in with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that K run is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's Director of Adriebmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that K Running would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": The Indian State of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the Navy headquarters, covered in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag hoisted.
River basins from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country of Bolivia, the memory of a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the desire to sail on the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for several decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a judgment from the International Court on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will agree with Bolivia that, after several decades of discussion, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that no major changes would occur if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to oversell Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the International Court declines judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been a setback.
"The question of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' military rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to "close an era of 139 years with disagreements and benefit both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never break down their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with promises made at a Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments were given in addition to the fact that the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a re-launch of the locked nuclear diploma over three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "desirous dream" to continue sanctions and US resistance to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare, as long as Pyongyang has not only taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious in terms of abolishing an arsenal that it most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion Shows in Paris reveals the latest collections with big headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk the veil for a collection of remarkable headwear of extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed by Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work by Valentino was an overgrown with a featherlike wide shadow that covered the models' heads.
There were also other extra big accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even an pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – right in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had laced lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled a snorkel and a mask, and others resembled a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could get to stores near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark, which is behind the most impractical hatred that was spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beachbag in straw that is almost as big as the model that shows it.
The orange bass bag with bass fries and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many beautiful academic results behind them, and it remains in 2018 with yet another outstanding exam results, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in the field of sport, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their pupils for higher and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As a training sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it hits his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits his heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students got the A in mandarin character, while 72 percent of those studying German received 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as a subject choice at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematicals in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons why employers could not occupy vacancies, 17% had to do with lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
In future, several job opportunities will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career they choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start to competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digital percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland there are differences between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment, and that must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction for Scotland's youth.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James playing his first match for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in the opening game of Sunday before the start of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
"Where I'm in my career I don't have to fight before the start of the season to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first out of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judge for the vacant seat at the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is seeking support for the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to accusations of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electoral meetings is to create a momentum for the Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that next week's five election sessions are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Consultation over Congress is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, which would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
Tonight's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to stand up to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, who is involved in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and tries to keep hope alive before Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented concept of sports, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see it as a momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he held the quarter.
Europe has, of course, the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high shouts of jubilee were higher as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important pit, which secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two battles behind two duels.
His pit, which assured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn't think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength ahead and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couple have got four points in four fights and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a booky Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience shows that it is the ones that it becomes hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory was captured by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Absolutely synchronized on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedes down into a hole they were never near to get out.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change rapidly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that the Team USA has the spirit of struggle, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates lead of 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and has so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated by an unprecise American team this morning's four-balls and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four battles, but they were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only second couple in Ryder Cup history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into four-balls and then elegantly defeated a brave Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5/4.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well-rested for the morning's four-balls and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and received a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
Europe, however, has exactly what they want on an easy-winding day south-west of Paris.
Threefold major-winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They had a hard fight 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind with four points before the singles. Since Furyks currently has the cup, however, they only have to achieve inadvertently to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not disarm unilaterally if there is no confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that continued sanctions reinforce their distrust of the United States and that it will not unilaterally abandon their nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the worldwide organization's general assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, deviating an area to nuclear tests and laws not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take the first step ourselves and disarm unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-distributed” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important because it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as otherwise it had been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atomic disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to humiliating international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'atom disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a desire dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our distrust."
Mr Ri did not mention any more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament had to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the launch of North Korea's rockets against mainland America was inevitable, after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and that sanctions have to remain until North Korea degrades.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a schedule for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, definitive, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of making "walking-like demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar steps", he demanded, were the safety levers that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalizing the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where one studied all night stopped up of large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that the students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after having kept a note of the effects of lack of sleep on learning.
"When the essay was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only told this now that I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of the University’s health area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm room where students must click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how their sporting performance is affected by lack of sleep and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, blood clots, depression and cancer over a long period of time.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect your health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking a "night" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students have led to a growing problem of lack of sleep.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and enough sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old californier who studied chemistry and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler to organize the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next one will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens that can move by the clock rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the ground when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to go to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was after their first victory in the field since the 4-1 trium at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard the second defeat in 18 battles as a coach. There are thus eight points up to Hearts on the first place of Ladbroke's Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers are now going down on a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the target score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, when line judges Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the outbound section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, who shaved a point of Hearts' lead last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausting the opponents all over the track.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Menga's first episode sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midwayer's attempt passed.
A frispark in the depths of Keaghan Jacobs found a way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
Rangers took control, however, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was not satisfied at least when Judge Steven Thomson signed the Colombian appeals for a penal park when he and Steven Lawless broke together after a quarter of a game.
Rangers had only two shots of target in the first half, but former Rangers' target Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and the silent shot of Oviedo Ejaria.
Even though Livis’ opening in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said that he deserved their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers could not handle a death-ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga, who could easily kick it to the finish.
During the break Gerrard Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave a paw when the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the endurance to play on their precincts with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the final part of the match, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow beat alongside goals.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penal park after being dried with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way.
Yearbook: Founder of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELLER... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "His" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixed component of both science and popular culture, as could be seen in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the lead role as peasant scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It is a violin counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes."
Evans: "Come on, now it's happening!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many forms of cancer and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was built off when he hailed the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand up as Presidential candidate by 2020.
After playing the third song Ghost Town of the evening wearing a Make America Great Again casket, he began a dark talk against the Democrats and held his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charge.
Although the recordings were not shown, the comedian Chris Rock Wests played on the social media.
It's not sure if Rock tried to exhibit West by recording.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage due to its headwear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And they said I was deeply sunk," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I'm sunk?" and said that he would wear his Superman cap because it means "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience bowed at least twice by his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly affected, says Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bomb still in the studio."
West had been booked as replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: DO NOT COME TO YOU OF THE PUBLISH."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's fine."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art") who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show the rapper had announced that he had taken name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to have changed his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rapkollena Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man on Friday was stabbed with a knife at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The case took place in Ballyhakkamore, says the police.
The defendants are expected to be brought before the Belfast U.S. Supreme Court on Monday.
The sentences are examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington long after toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor goes a long way after the stereotypical macho hero and says that these kind of TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies to him "very mind".
"Today, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase of toxic masculineity due to the very masculine nature.
He went on to say, "What is inborn, and what is tainted?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel like they should be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make followers of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit participates in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple was married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS citizens.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018, only 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in one year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997 homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of their conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to a lack of prevention in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles claimed that the claims were based on websites and supported by the "extended right wing".
"The lie, the lie, the lie, and several terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter report.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers on the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the web by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It occurred during a hearing in the Senate about accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Poundit of RedState announced that IP addresses pointed out that the information had been provided by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is totally untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"Member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is totally untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' announcement quickly got criticism online, including from former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't be sloppy.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to keep the peace of mind."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-term election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Bright, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the law enforcement authorities regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – overwhelming spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British ice sheet, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satisfaction be the country's new export potential, if we are to be satisfied?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with the rubber face and the big eyes, has been given his permission to re-examine the roarers. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical discovery aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and proper blade of the one who performed a single tone for the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lukewarm pants that left chaos in his cool water, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertisements.
There are some good moments in this latest shoot at the tribe of JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite subtly and strangely superfluous, especially now how more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impressible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie thrills in the role of Mr. Bean.
The endless current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and struggling prime minister who already suffers a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is required to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it's the clumsy Johnny English, who is now the school inspector at a high-class school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English was rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hard tried former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overly enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was spilled on.
Thus, the royal intelligence service is very close to Batman and Robin back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is swindling close to being embezzled by the charismatic and scary tech-billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their furious risky escapades: dressed as servants they set fire to a noble French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize himself with Volta's house.
All the guns are fired in the final sequence of the film, but however well-meaning and energetic it may be, there is a sense of children's view of it.
Fairly moderate.
And I couldn't help thinking about the other Johnny English movies: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to barsel with plan for four-day work week with unchanged pay to the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can live up to a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have business managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without losing their wages.
Sources state that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic objective of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"This is not going to happen one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting recording his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to flee the power back from "annyme directors" and "exploitors" in utilities.
The plans of the Minister of Shadow Finance also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour could "return" them in the light of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in corporate boards and to set up including ownership funds, which will distribute 10 percent of the equity value of private companies to employees, who will receive up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation of accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's find could lead the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steel-settled, determined and unequivocal."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will attract attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert fans must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or any other meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really change, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature on the web or making a Twitter lookup?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding objectives and political measures that are equivalent to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over 10 billion dollars, which had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that so far these funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong players. They strive to "help children to experience their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, the social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the website's frequently asked questions, which says, "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But like the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to 'block' Russian energy exports, says the U.S. Minister for the Interior
"If necessary", Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, even in the Middle East, to reveal to Washington Examiner the U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia's interference in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government – is an pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And, according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"With our fleet, the United States has the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the waterways, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a nonprofit organisation that considers itself "the voice of the American energy user".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration spokespersons, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and simply because of economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party mixing in our energy supplies," said the head of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the Presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's "considered strongly" to stand up for the presidential election after the mid-term election, she said Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering setting up.
"It's time women went to Washington and repaired our political system, and it takes a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will give strong thought to putting up with the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion about President Donald Trump during the city council and said that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a 2nd Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI will investigate the case before the vote."
A Thursday opinion poll shows, however, that most of Warren's own hinterland does not believe that she should set up by 2020.
According to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not establish.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against possible formation.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed during the Presidential elections in 2020 are among other former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The bid states that he announces his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged for domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he's come home makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries our soldiers are returning home with," she told the audience to a Trump-elector meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other veterans of war that "they have changed and have become harder; they go and think whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the report of domestic violence and to be in possession of a gun in a drunken state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 States and District of Columbia support a legal objection against a new American law refusing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence or violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. made a party-dependent statement on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The applicant's full name in the Grace vs. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberty Union submitted in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She claims that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers come, as countries with far-reaching problems of domestic gangs and violence.
The new US asylum law overturned a decision by the U.S. Foreign Office in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing from domestic violence to seek asylum.
On Friday, District Attorney Karl Racine of Columbia stated that the new law "is missing from decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against the principle," the party-dependent statement states.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on refusing immigrants harms the US economy, as there is a higher probability that they will become self-employed and "provide necessary labour."
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Session's immigration judges withdrew the right to grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political stance," said Sessions in his announcement of the Law of 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
While the death rate doubles, the attempts to find survivors in Palu desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her little fever-shattered boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with dead bodies.
We need clean water."
The residents now returned to their ruined homes to sort out the bloodthirsty possessions and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also affected by the earthquake of 7,5, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors for severe relapses.
He got tears in his eyes when he told me how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I got masted against a ruined wall, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to the wedding in town.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper brought a fireside ad in an American daily that hit the drum for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, the American ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Dailys's paid entry into Des Moines Register – Iowas' best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in the 6th November Congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the U.S. election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in an escalating trade war where they have imposed duties on each other's imports in several rounds.
China’s retaliatory duty in the trade war was to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, believes Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China's former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural food products to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "takes up the use of the unpleasant methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," said Branstad.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find only a few disagreements, and you will not get a true picture of the Chinese people's differing views on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a counter reaction in the upcoming mid-term elections, especially from women.
The matter has put the emotions in the boil, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This cannot be done about it," said Grant Reher, professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said that he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours would relieve angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators shouted: "November comes!", when the Republicans controlling the judicial committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new height", said the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters – 18-29-year-olds – who rarely vote, despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford's public accusations about the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that the Republicans would have to go back on nomination.
"It has become a worse mess for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote or final result of the committee, nor about Kavanaugh being held responsible; it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have dealt with her," points Guy Cecil, who is chairman of Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on who they should believe in according to the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter has a little more on their side.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony, or probably, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh either probably or certainly lied under his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After a call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations made by Ford and at least another one, says Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Legal Committee last week that when she was 17 years old, Kavanaugh completely attacked her.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated her gender parts for a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology League is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology, so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's managing director, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to gather resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change it all completely so that all their business models suddenly become superfluous."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a reference to Medium last Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet that is built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the Internet's next period," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Gejlig recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is celebrated
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I is celebrated in his hometown 100 years after.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order of September 29, 1918, under the attack of Bellenglice and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievable symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918 led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy gun fire and artillery."
He later ran up to the front line and led his people with the "greatest manslaughter" before he alone attacked an artillery and harmless three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the star-picked Bellator 206 and then you're denied to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald got ready to meet, the viewers in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimposed after they had stayed awake early in the morning for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m. why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's executive director, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include English viewers in planning in the future.
"Whenever we think about the retransmission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But the time is six Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change took place, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly together.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was the law.
I can promise you, it won't happen next time.
We only had five fights instead of six that we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt less valuable than everyone else in his childhood because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't go up for him until he got into the larger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he was talking about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host of the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken free for a few months due to illness.
Daley was a guest in the Laver's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his childhood because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From now on, the feelings of feeling worthy of mind and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronzewinner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said that he had been "surrendered" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it's hard to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspectives had changed".
"If you had asked me last year, it would all be a matter of winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first occurred to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – to dive in front of a home audience at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs run on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Usharp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it doesn't become a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets the record by joining the 12th time in the competition, which is settled every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's four-balls and foursomes.
Instead of being at the U.S. Center of Events as usual, the five - double grand winner had to act as a cheerleader and practice his game in hopes of correcting the whips.
Even at the height of the career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes stray shots.
And if the course wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet at the ninth battle on Sunday the ever-precious winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 singles, start strong, Mickelson's battle can be decisive.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on my back, put his arm around me, and said that he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I guess I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I imagined that he would play more, but that's how it went and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo beats the record for most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely been able to measure with his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven indecisive ones, even though Furyk said that his presence contributes with something infinitable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the holdroom," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great lead can disappear quickly
European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of Ryder Cups single-handedness can quickly become annoying.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a head start at five points over the Americans, but was just getting caught before the finish with a win of 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team winning both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have to be full-blown tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus lies.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side – the best golfers in the world."
Delighted by the performance of his players on a difficult track, Bjørn added: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow's a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that count, and that is something else.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters like golfing.
That's what the players need to understand – bring out the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he also has to make the best of himself."
And so it looks like opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fryk himself has experienced conversations in the last day, first on the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said, when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the middle struggles.
We'll put our teams together and put the players on the line in the order we feel for. We'll try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the backlash and facing Rory McIlroy in the top fight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group players in this order because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bear about his choice of single players.
Germany’s New Warship Pushed Again
The latest frigate of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year more because of technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Palatinate", is postponed to the first six months of 2019 according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, have to replace the aging fergates from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a minor need for maintenance: It should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to cause Germany to appear as an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125-frey created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the surrender, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusable in battle situations.
Software error was of particular importance since the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that is only half that crew from the older Bremen-fregates.
It also turned out that the ship was far too heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced the fleet's ability to make future updates.
The 7000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Palatinate" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project that includes training the crew is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached dizzying €3.1 billion (3.6 billion), with an initial price of € 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Government's Defence Committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of ready-to-lay ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Sneaks to the Secret Life of the Bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is carried out by scientists from Scotland’s National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-haired bats and water bats at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Data from NTS personnel and volunteers are also collected using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show what kind of action is taking.
To produce a detailed landscape view of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar Nature Conservation Adviser hopes that the results reveal which areas of the habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation, such as the establishment of meadows, and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger. The same can include flu traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced eco-localisation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect shipowners and sometimes make rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bats.
David Thompson, responsible for the area, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeve we have a very good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is much you don't know about bats, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasises the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, thus risking the destruction of an entire local population.
The bat is protected, and it is illegal to kill, bother or disturb them or their shipowners.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bat, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations are developing."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he has paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
Some hours after the allegations had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of the Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they have called "an inexcusable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere" according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class equal to the accusation that is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly held in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayora allegedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal, according to the report submitted to the city court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" caught by "one percent".
The file claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court, because she felt "fear of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old now says that she will overturn the agreement as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event was due to take place, and this summer changed to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'anxious' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March," said the executive director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they're going to close their mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is to deal with risks to the supply chain in the event of a withdrawal without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's production at the Derbyshire plant, and then production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "combined so that they are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statements by Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce factory competitiveness, which in the end will cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more worried: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says The White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for a week more", as determined around the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein, the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, looks at the shoulder during his investigation of Russian electoral interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of devoting the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, a meeting was held on Thursday with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate court hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual abuse, should testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings wasn't due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree with them playing up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepted more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We have looked at the figures."
Press sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health contacts EU staff in the Scottish health services after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continue, and it seems that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know this must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU come with valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay very much.
Christion Abercrombie Gets Acute Surgery After Head injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a major damage on Saturdays 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports it from Tennessee's Mike Organ.
First coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and took him into further investigation.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there is no "any detail about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State tries to find out when he committed the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is in progress with his first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he left the game, which gives him 18 tackles collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamps when they buy a property in Britain.
This move must dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp when buying properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The drag will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper homes and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and companies who do not pay tax in the UK. The income from it must be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is added to the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multiple-home purchases and purchases for rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold inside the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "speech cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices up by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas in cheap housing to solve Britain's "dammitable housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching series of housing reforms, including the control of renting prices and the withdrawal of the landlord's ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be said that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as for hardworking British people.
For far too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach."
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point becoming Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He changed to Stadium of Light this summer after looking back at St. Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn into me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I were successful in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he had no reservations about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I'm measuring success from the point of view of whether "I can get this club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years inside the career that trains after a period of assistant training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coaching staff.
Then he helped Alloa to come back after being moved down in the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the bow down to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real severance path," he remembers about the time in Alloa.
"I honestly thought that the training was right for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds weird because I did fine, served wisely and had some success.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There's still that kind of stress and pressure that's training, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to practice, and now I'm doing it. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5.30 p.m., showing study
The heat wave this summer has increased the profit for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while sales in restaurants went down by 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long World Cup has meant that July follows June's pattern, where the pubs experienced sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are now harder hit.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages were clearly the best and experienced progress similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
The sales of beverages increased by 6.6 % across pub and bar chains for the month, while food decreased by 3.3 %."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the out-of-home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that the restaurants are still struggling, even though a decrease in sales of 4.8% years after year will hurt really at rising costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give a hard-pressed breath."
The overall increase in sales totaled for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7 % in July, showing the decline in newly started fires.

Each fifth child has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Each fifth child – down to 11 years of age – has secret accounts on social media, as they hide from their parents and teachers, shows research.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren in 4-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be put on the table
20% of the students said they have a "head account" that they can show their parents
Each fifth child down to 11 years of age creates accounts on the social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th class and reveals strong growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the services of Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being put up.
20% of the students said that they have a "head account", which they can show their parents, while they also have private.
A mother who fell over his 13-year-old daughter's secret account, so a teenager who called on others to "enforce me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can't find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of the athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics at the Annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletics enthusiast, and President Ian Bette described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world of Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the athlete's voice, and I hope that I can contribute and help shape a direction for sport in Scotland."

The doctors said time would show whether I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly well, I've learned to go back and do today's agile exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers with cows, gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent chest pump”, the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement that will show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a costume filled with hay, for a song in which it reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't yvere, it's my tits."
It says, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "striches" by the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and fed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in an ama-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "Not an Insensitive Advertising."
One woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievable fun."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women reveal that they have danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in an ama-bh, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even walk out while they pumps.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognizable way we showed the freedom that the new pump can provide."
This is not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, even though the number of border guards has not changed. This is partly due to a more severe rhetoric and the scratching laws of Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their ability to stay in the country by standing up and taking a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure criminal records.
"Close to 80 % of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households, they reside illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we keep chasing those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to deal more quickly with children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within a month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of personally meeting up and talking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unfit for residence are quickly deported.
The longer children become in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape, says assistants and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced at major plants such as Tornillo, where size makes it harder to monitor if a child is suffering.
They added that relocation to a tentland town without mental preparation or the possibility of saying goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many already struggle with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism "is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and several million have fled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to 'fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian territories' for both terrorist groups and 'illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, and then he accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing unwarranted fear", which led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these missions," he said.
"They're politicizing what was supposed to be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid will not be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province, where three million lives.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a spring group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for a election.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the work of the panel must be limited to "examining the legislation of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on that logic, Trump will probably be re-elected by 2020, unless the case and the scandals end his presidential period in advance, which many liberal viewers are hoping for.
In what is undoubtedly going to be "the most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
Currently, there is no sign of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, the ratings in the best send time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC Drama Designated Survivor on a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a cabal in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But contrary to all other television programmes, the stories that come from Washington can determine the matter between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged wonder.
And yet this is about more than being enlightened citizens when you see six hours of panel debate where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ratchet jacket for $15,000 ("dressed with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating crew and daily surprises (scannings with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're fired.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Great summers find their way to the close middle of the election to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money. As a result of an equalization of two "Congressional Districts", two congressmen fight for the same seat.
This recently reorganised suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned, after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in the Republican favor.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for financial resources between the committees of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice of high vigilance in March's special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on Republicans' hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but redefined itself
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw Trump's management team out.
Foreign Minister officials decided to call senior US diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Foreign Minister's spokeswoman in an announcement earlier in the month.
But it was only El Salvador who was punished, and they got about $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on admission permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they would have the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the consideration of penalties to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal of the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three American exiles secretly took back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke based on a condition of anonymity.

The next obstacle could well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is reported that Mueller will also address his investigation into whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come on new hands, Trump would probably be held accountable as he prepares to meet the electorate again, and in time, of course, a jury of his companions.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable – and so is his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the battle will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put in a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the long - term bloodbath thereafter.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inevitable march of democracy is increasing or decreasing.
In the United States there are now several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been hot since this newspaper could announce that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times's production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if the F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly implemented – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we vote in favour of a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied my embassy’s homeland.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me away 60 years later to light Sabbath lights on the table with the rooster.
How can I be anything but optimistic about that in my luggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Thursday against SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, with a victory against the Austrians, they will have good opportunities to move forward from the Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented the midwayer Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2--game against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could bring something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all in all it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably best in the first half, but we got out in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last fight, but with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide study reported that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they were talking to their kids about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices may be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have an economy for it.
Get organized the legal documents: Take the legal battles in the riot.
Get a proxy so you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic mandate.
In that case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the option.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down to writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's looking after the dog?

Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip into town.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting that took place at about 2:30 p.m. as "quite by chance."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police call witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of the question, relief workers have not been able to receive information from the Donggala, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake struck.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Soviet province and is situated at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regent that stretches over 300 km of coastline on the northwest part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the Central Soviet economy, especially in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but mainly takes place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster centre, Palau and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically affected by the so-called intrusion of the Pacific Ocean and regularly by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and until April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7,5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s reign in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004’s deadly earthquakes and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the notification of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is in custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "unquestionably not guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which can lead to a penalty on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under review at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, preventing the notification of a violent crime in the home and possession of weapons in affected condition of the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a blow to her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son's violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake is setting.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach party in Palu, when tsunami broke down to the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get the terrorist suspect in NYC sentenced to a rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was finally sentenced to a crime in the State in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the road were hauled down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the declaration of intent for death sentences in the southern district of New York.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both of these claims.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov with 22 points, including eight charges of murder in gangster business, typically used by public prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "concealing planning and preparations," said the prosecutors, and described Saipov's execution as "unbelievable, evil and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habiblaevic Saipov caused injury, damage to the body and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states in the Memorandum of Understanding.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district finally brought an action for the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was recently imposed on a state case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the legal documents, Saipov came from Uzbekistan and showed no sign of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well with his actions.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to get the ISIS flag hung up in his hospital room, told the cops.
He has denied guilty in the 22 points of the D.A.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "self-inflicted" against the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have "be out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in creating a collection in the deeply divided party is underlined by the participation of conservative remainers in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attack from both Brexites, Remainers and the European Union.
Her allies insist that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out now," he said.
The Secretary of Wellingborough added, "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone's.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied that the public's position should have changed since the vote in 2016: "that the British people should have changed their mind and would like to remain in the European Union is absolutely wrong."
The Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers Plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected in.
Now drop Chequers and start listening.'
As a point of reference to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the intruder that politicians should be able to "label the pressure" if they fail the decision of the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we will not let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feels the pressure.
"We mobilize the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we don't stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK."
Meanwhile, the remainers marched through Birmingham before a totimer's recording in the middle of town.
Distributed activists waved with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security problems with the conservative party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and the technology for Canada, for border controls, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up to the Presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren's "considers strongly to stand up to the presidential election" after the mid-November elections.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future at a city council meeting on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, must try to re-election against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
One has wondered if she would challenge Trump by 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the town hall since Trump took over the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to stand up to the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest in case of gunfire on LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the footage.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and killed by the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, in possession of a weapon, and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody of the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter-high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played on average 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prize: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Cup, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead position Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in pit as the first, and left Hamilton to fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went into action later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when after some wheel contact the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner runway after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
After that he led in a large part of the race, as he in an attempt at a quick end failed to change tires to take the fourth place of Kimi Raikkonen.
He had to go to the 44th round, but could not increase the tempo of the last eight rounds, so the Raikkon secured the fourth place.
"It's a tough day because Valteri did it fantastic all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team did an incredible piece of work to ensure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sex abuse.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford in front of the Legal Committee of the American Senate, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "unkind and disgusting and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that happened the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, hold on a second.
Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in a imitation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comet, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They spare no means in their efforts to withdraw power.
You can see the evilness, the repugnantness they don't care about who they have to drum in order to gain power and control," said the president, Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants vs Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League match against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly came in front with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made up their homes before Dwyer brought Giants in front again.
Francois Bouchard made up for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as victors in the previous three battles.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute of 3:35 from an assistant from Kendall McFaulll with David Rutherford as an assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During a busy first period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five matches, are home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a flight with several hundred passengers was safely brought down on the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake in Friday's Sulawesi island hit and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful rebuffs still devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthony Gäsan Agung's colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his seat in the floating control tower in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway, was probably airborne.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later in the hospital.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said according to the Australian ABC News that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach several thousand and the country's disaster preparedness announces limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many dead bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to get to them," said spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, who is holding a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance with more bodies comes.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work 24 hours a day to carry out all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people were driving to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers were hospitalized until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the American Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go to life to get to the exits on the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and yelled and he had a minor head injury.
The American Navy said that sailors working to renovate a quay nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to transport people on land before the plane sank to about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office concluded its evidence on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analysts at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, made testimony for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teledata to combine the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his earlier claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed that he was visiting Sanford with his friend Michael Sanford, the police.
Sanford sat in the witness room on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to tell the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that day.
The High Breed: What is political hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York Children's Girl Claims Couples After Firing With "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating firing after having received a text message by an error from the mother who complained that she was "still a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "presence."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her horror at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEJ, NOT END NOW A SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, who from Africa-American, had been bad at her work and that she expected instead a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice claims that the couple should be remunerated for the firing and compensation for $350 a day for the six months in which she should have lived with the family, even though this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't do such a thing," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Come on.
Plasco compared the case with "presence" and that his wife had born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really going after someone like that?
It's not very friendly done," added the investment adviser.
Although the trial is still under way, the People's Court of Justice has already written off the couple on social media and disgraced their conduct and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty funny to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a little clothesbum, would have been optimistic even if his story was rejected and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitters-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of her success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like bragging," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, even though it is not really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Something called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart running was slowly losing its effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for this to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and my tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Stimulating women are trying to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief that I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"His smile was known to everyone.
People said his smile brightened the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he felt really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Do not go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to anyone."
Sharon Davis' long-standing girlfriend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sorry or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is still unclear, while the FBI is initiating investigations.
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a time-limited study with limited scope – we could perhaps get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday and added, "he feared that the comet "had fallen from the hind" in the middle of the locked partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, do not succeed, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have elected to the country's highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called Senators to help them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has completed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unknown whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers falls under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong suck referred to data from the Ministry of Transport of South Korea and said that there were 1,127 decapitators last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed figures.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In time, the vast majority of high-ranking people from North Korea are being offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean Government states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border facing North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China sees the despair as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so that they are often forced homes.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is still at war technically – has improved significantly over the last few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met to discuss the stranded negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at a global level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no belief in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will disarm ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is unfit for the Supreme Court
Chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated Supreme Court judges, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, one would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected the accusations that he had committed sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke about his family and his years in high school, he almost shouted and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated attitude towards character" arranged by the left wing, angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the Presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went outside when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh before a Kingdom court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he does not speak true to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly also in the court in which he sits now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as Judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in connection with Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It is a fair outcome, several months and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I received great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the one she was talking to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an excess of men, where I was often crying for anger, where I was taken at the neck of an elderly woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see that you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll appreciate that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was at that time a member of the Colorado Congress, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could just as well stand up as a presidential candidate herself.
"It wasn't a very well-thought-out decision," she said grinning to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn't participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach out to voters instead of electors, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"One could imagine that I had a nervous breakdown," reminds Schroeder of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what will you write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
This is how the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage for Beijing.
The opening anointing in the trade war between the United States and China was loud, and even though the battle has been far from over, division between countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The greatest escalation of this week of new customs duties affecting goods of a value of USD 200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the USA from China.
Beijing has paid back every time, most recently by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to provide just as preliminary.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it would be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A fast decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, researcher with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, believes Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state of affairs.
All the conditions are now in place for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that struck their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since 2011 when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian Government was pleased to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped to support the rebellion.
Europe guarantees Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16.5 - 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it difficult in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on par 3 on 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received the 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
The American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest-ranked European player, the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world ranking list, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm really glad to get the trophy back.
This is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said one emotionalist Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fax to his compatriot John Ram, who brought down the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of having beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a spooky statistic for one of the best golfers ever, who has won 14 great titles, only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the guys, because they fought for the case.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe countermeasures.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, and I'll work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we'll move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
