Members of the Welsh Assembly worried they're going to look like stupid.
There is an exhibition among some meeting members about the suggestion that their title should change from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it rhyms with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternative ones.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "recognizable" about the name change, but has noticed that it is a short speech leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter is pronounced you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "Of course, the final decision on any description of what is called the members of the Assembly will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that had been widely supported to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As far as the AM's title was concerned, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMP's, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's are apparently proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who must present a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way the meeting operates, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendums on changing country’s name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has for some time already demanded that the name of its neighbour in the north represent a claim on his territory and repeatedly objected to his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem are struggling
'Historys spoken,' said the old people to whom I spoke, there was a bar and a church on each corner, 'says Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize these days in other ways," he said.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is worried that the money from stock sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with condominiums of the type that will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will bring even closer to the day that these churches completely close, because most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis--Mepolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation who worshiped nearby took over the building's title.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Eerw. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What has been playing at Saint Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, made up of laymen - wrote in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "try to pass the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese’s side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, says officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then rowing with a group closer to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch; but then he realized 'that he called,' I was bitten!
I'm bit!'
His whole key leg was torn open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
'I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!''' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Kinderhospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known what shark species are responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media guidance session that a shark was noticed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting with department store-type beauty corridors manned by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods receding, the larger beauty courses in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if it is a success next year taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury's says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more place with trademark-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique-grimming series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something more and more younger buyers insist on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop concessions will test in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back the Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years ago, which according to their grocery sales strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended on an argument about how to divide the profit from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special-educated colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names is designed to meet every need and the tempting environment and convenient locations means that we are now an alluring beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'wrong' after Holly Willoughby withdrew to £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'wrongly' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones furiously by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrong" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1,5 million - mean that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothes-and-income-trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would, according to Inaugural Willoughby's planned £11 million fortune have doubled.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's biggest priority at far away.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her has completely ignored all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday that was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes the most money flow in, can rush millions out of the bag because of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to dress and household clothes, and the possibility that his introduction might encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples spend vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He ridiculed criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he had made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma-"newsreader voice".
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a great step after the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But nuclear disarmament negotiations were burning.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities more than three months after the June leadership convention in Singapore.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention talk.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea," he said."
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim yielded positive results — ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing back the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach to describing relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing right there," Trump said pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Roetolf and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed island, killed hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they didn't ask for international help, which made it a bit difficult," said I. Summing.
Although Save the Children is compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Regrettably, given the earth’s tremor that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu has probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning of strength.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is most challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's refined infrastructure a core of his election campaign and hesitantly spent money on roads and railways.
But Joko’s administration is faced with fund failures as he faces next year’s reelection.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of sloppy sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim might have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands escaped as Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported for Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before jumping far to the target pole.
The attempt sailed high across the frame as it hovered to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga dropped and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and typed once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea was by half time 1-0 ahead after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had registered a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head played back to Mateo Kovacic in that back-up playroom before he was tolerating near the middle field and in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward head he then led Hazard into the window.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal.
Liverpool goes on Wednesday at 3 p.m. to fight Napoli at the Champions League group stage at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes to Videoton on Thursday to stand 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Deaths rise to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, early Sunday the country’s disaster agency said.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings that struck the earthquake on Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, and caused waves of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was sown with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, suspected of murder after woman's death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with knifesticks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the circumference of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashboard film material, to contact us as they may have information that could be indispensable to us.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who are believed to know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued, since the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Citizens are now said to take hours before they are reinstated.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said 'it's so awful.
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to turn @MerPolCC at DM, 101 or turn Crime Stoppers anonymous at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's status of Cromwell is the newest commemorative hit with 'rewrite of history'-twiss
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "society" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statutes that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manjiphic portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe is memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a perfectly accurate portrayal is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is stated is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Killvark Ripper Chinese Boer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who was only identified by his of, "Yuan", was found with a torn-off artery with blood covered dead near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring piggyback.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pond pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bled and torn," said the cousin, who was called "Wu", quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police had collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities reportedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound pig had tied a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife had scared the animal down.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playing.
They're dicks, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest United States.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.u., a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. to the east, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a Trog begins to form across the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical moisture north-west into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rain of up to 10 inches on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture in response to the approaching trough over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause site rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Slight floods may be with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - gaped deserted rivers to touch and thunderstorms to bring severe local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall figures of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause small waste flow and smooth lanes.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical showers will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains start to spread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperatures across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central US is on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lethargic summer temperatures will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will start warm October, with widely spread 80's from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above average temperatures for the Eastern US for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh interrogation
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks for the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political peak continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's up-to-the-minute turn: an agreement established by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was betaing her in drunkenness and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts Kavanaugh’s appointment strongly supported, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s hearing, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning CNN and CBS where protestors shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a Legal Committee.
He stood with closed eyes for a few minutes while CNN was alive picturing how he was being mispronounced.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all later covered living hours when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do it with the understanding that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Democrat minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump filed an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and the subversion of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second degree murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-infected WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
On Friday, East Baton Rouge Parish's judicial bodywork issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University Police and territory citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva thanked territorial law application for his "evidence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-ses predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 return jumps per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "placing" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you keep worrying about," said Wayde.
Volcano Spikes as at Mexico City
As spewing out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity has picked up in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash releases over 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple drones and tremors.
Images on social media have shown how thin low - gas motor windshields cover in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which was sitting 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalonian separatists for commemoration of independence
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence demonstrators collided with riot police, and thousands joined in oppositions to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for disdain.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police, they threw eggs and powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets usually teeming with tourists.
A gigging also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their bats to control the fighting.
For several hours pro-independence groups have sung on one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' shout of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries contracted in the processions, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Chosen ones voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those who boycotted largely the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote from continuing at the polling stations throughout the region.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I have seen my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now stab us," he said.
Despite a vital but scarce victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their best known leaders either in self-appointed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who had recorded the demonstration on his phone in support of the police, says the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pre-trial arrest since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to dissuade the decline in democratic values and the oppression we saw from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates were damaged and the building itself was built.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a time after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone ensures victory
Advanced Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as director of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose was proof of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without losing weight and next week faced the forerunners Heart, who are ahead of them eight points.
Rangers are first host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unsurpassed run in the division to six games, with principal coach Holt who has still not suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities against bot visitors
Holt's team must have run ahead long before they signed on for a purpose, with their clumsiness that got Rangers into all sorts of troubles.
SR had broken through, but had worn before the goal corner, then AL could play only wide after he had approached and CH’s head had met across the target gate.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with moments of death.
And thus came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingstone created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turnoff from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow had typed wide to avoid still open game from Livingston.
Crosses repeatedly reached Livingstone’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two punishments — after Halkett’s challenge of replacing Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were dismissed.
‘Fenomenal’ of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward path.
Their game style and team have been almost unchanged since their return to first place, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic in his manjiphic defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as they did at times under Gerrard, they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of an alarm for Rangers, who found them in middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September), leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outburst on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from meeting before the mosque, but many supporters came next to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of their Kurds – have also made their voices thick, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The warring demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is hailed as hero by some German Turks and is evicted by others as autocrats.
Deptford Road accident: Bicycle driver dies in collision with engine
A cyclist died in a collision in London where a car was involved.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap on Childrens Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work on identifying the man and alerting his neighbors.
Road closures and bus turns were advised instead, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards in riot injury
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security man's prison, the prison office said.
Uproar broke out about 09:30 BST Sunday and continues at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" was called in to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison minister said: "Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chieftain of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which staff were attacked with pooling balls.
Hurricane Rosa Dreeg Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflue (Drogtegebiete Trek Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and carries fast - flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued fast - flooded wakes for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa Tuesday is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweit that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with insulated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inch, with isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
Rosa’s rain is likely to be a blessing for those outside of the fast - flood risk since the region is being plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drogentemonitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reportedweather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricane - strong Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, so her power decreases.
So Monday or evening, she is expected to reach the country at tropical storm power in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainvaltuals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," saidweather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north across Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - threatening floods and torrents of debris in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 4:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials called on anyone who might have had any cell phone image material of what had happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'feeling in common, the rage' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "had suffered under the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and fiercely and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he said to the band of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "stand up and hinder."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to occur no later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian tremor, tsunami, with still rising figures
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach when fires of up to six feet (18 feet) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-scale earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and didn't run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday aftershocks shook the coastal city.
A range of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant quake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that had dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely obstructed with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people who live there, said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they had not told that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it can be heard that a man on the upper floor of a building shouts despairing warnings about the approaching tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and sleigh buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power disruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but vacationers still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was going to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision’s personnel from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers were hiding in deckhouse shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they passed by on their way to scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even while aid groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some people complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented with much experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas may not begin until the disaster area has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a disaster on provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we could open it up for international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken from a sewer pipe.
Sunday, rescue workers saved a woman for two days under rubble was pressed with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paratrooper team, arranged two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paratroopers, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated among the paratrooper community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray rule, instead of two blue rules.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26 750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Lifee
Thieves stole $26 750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Life, according to a news release from the Newport Police.
The car's manager was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw various suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for some time been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio-tender Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye – only the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Among other things, Sean Combs had been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has also finished with or without a connector and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was on the run until the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students promised never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were poaching throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract youth to gangs.
US should double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount spent on research in this field, investor and AI practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even though the U.S. has shorted a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, last year China announced their plan: to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of reaching the next major AI performance in the U.S., said Lee vandeesweek in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980's at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that knocked on the highest-rated American Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last months came under fire.
Macedonians must vote in election or change country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbour’s name represents a demand in the field and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments made an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign had raised doubts as to whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendums to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that by 1 p.m. there were no reports of inconveniences.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring out their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and approached chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the large majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he had delivered his vote.
He said a "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another recording, performed by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy for his purpose in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine target header received a gesture at the center of the field.
He chased between three Brighton defensemen before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before crossing several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed a gesture to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the hok to send back the ball for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are fortunate that he has at that moment recorded a purpose."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball next to the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest corner.
The Sky Blues predictor kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back.
City takel Hoffenheim in Kampioneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the playoffs, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to start the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had won at least a pro-car break with a 5-2 win over the National Friday evening, but still want to capture their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year in the face.
Why won't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favored to have Scherzer throw into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-exercise on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 exhales in 220 2/3 turn this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court electorate Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid - term elections.
"All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "A man sees this awful, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the sneezing.
They don't care who hurt them, about whom they should walk to get power and control, that is what they want, power and power, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand up and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "bad and mean and crafty and false."
He referred in the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received a hard bean from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It’s Intolerant to Those Who Say What They Think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string Workers' Party LPs to whom it was said that we were not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers’ Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyer, more kind" politics is long forgotten, if it ever began.
It became increasingly evident that different views were not tolerated within the Workers’ Party and that each opinion was judged on the basis of whether it was acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political outlooks, began expecting me to make a U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether about national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there is a tyrate of slander on social media who ask me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have great respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who each day face a flood of sexist or racist insults, but never startled away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so outspoken, and that I will then be "obvious."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Workers' Party as a student 32 years ago, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who voted for the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that's headed for a Brexit that's going to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political benefit will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have torn the final outcome slightly wrong, but there is no doubt that Ayr has earned to triumph in this wonderful-exciting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, which carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We have been tested so far in our games and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor of Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made that Ayr was in front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintentioned three.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty head, just before he, just before resttime intended a solo three to make it rest period 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, imagined by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long stop for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the gap with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then found a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintentioned three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson found a yellow card because he had taken over for Climo without the ball, and from the penitentiary MacPherson put the ball to death after the upcoming Ayr-lost.
Climo meant it, as he also almost did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had found David Armstrong's head and then Gregor Henry sent away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to take on a new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game star is going to move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedy friend Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming ninth season would be the program’s last, and K runs seems to be preparing for life in Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Krund wants to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': land surrounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a masonry-covered fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are plagued with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country - surrounded Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh — the need to catch up with the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia awaited a verdict by the international court of law on October 1, after 5 years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faced a controversial struggle for reelection next year – also faced many who depended on Monday’s verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that few would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes only six months after the last move shows that the case "was not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down for the past four years.
"The question of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric had tapped any remaining Chilean favoritism, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be tremendously difficult to engage in harmful conversations.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of differences with reciprocal advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Affairs Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a conference in Singapore between the leaders of the competing countries.
His remarks follow US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is evidently on the brink of re-establishing nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and US capillaries to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without first taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second discussion.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country considers as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large head coverings on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn away the sun, you don’t have to search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of law enforcement oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the treadboard that enchanted the style at Paris Fashionweek.
Extremely impractical hats crossed this summer’s Instagram, and these designers paraded their dazzling creations on the treadboard.
The excellator by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other major additions included water oranges decorated with jewels, a sorcerer's hat and even a pineapple – but it's not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had dressed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation seemed like scuba gear, including a snorkel and goggle, while another looked like a molten ice horn.
And if you continue the great fashion statement, it is your happy day.
Stylekeepers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultuse label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social, sent another great creation over the walkboard – a straw-beach bag almost as big as the swimsuit-clothed model it wore.
The roasted orange raffiasak, finished with raffiasuits and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Well-known stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer — since the designer has made such a huge impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized extras.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a rites of academic excellence, and they continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which have only been strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schools and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that global languages continue as a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved a higher grade A.
The data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students had attained a higher grade A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages if necessary skills are undoubtedly needed by children and young adults in the future.
Now, as professionals, languages have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools' curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons employees provide why they have difficulty filling posts are attributed to 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically put a person above the competition.
According to a YouGov recording of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why investing in today’s language education is so important.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach that is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be recognized at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still enormously important to the country's future, and therefore must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It's an ugly bee.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that in Sunday's upcoming opening contest against the Denver Nuggets, James would play in San Diego.
But just how many minutes he is going to play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has whispered that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I didn't need to get ready at this point in my career for season games," he said.
Trump's West Virginia assembly time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will start tonight with a wave of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled contractions in the next week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held back for his choice of filling the subjects in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming interim election because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time is Trump's contraction in West Virginia tonight, and how does one look online afterwards?
Trump’s contraction in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can look below through living streaming to Trump's contraction in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus stated that these five assemblies were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters, while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Manage the Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name Reuters.
Tonight's contraction, arranged for the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month for Trump to visit West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help the West Virginian Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
"It's not a good sign to Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost to the polling box," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Riderbeker 2018: The U.S. team shows courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when entering Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider cup needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is an all-inspired sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we wear it as a little momentum, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points before and another twelve that are being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the baseball to the clean field and led by his example.
Those shrift celebrations got harder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win four completely equal at the same time as he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You must really take out everything and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all those players have left now.
18 pieces to print off their stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Ryderbeker.
Europe’s unmarried but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on track on Saturday afternoon, but they also kept one on track on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That rune, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this lavish crowd, confirms that they are the players who must be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can capture a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National pocket.
Preferably both at once or at different speeds.
It is too early, however, to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One controls track numbers and two doubles on the front nine led the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they couldn't even get near.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close by because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can turn into a blink of an eye.
So far, Europe has always played better as a team and has taken a significant lead on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has had the courage for the struggle some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe is running 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they have come out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a sighing Tiger Woods to take their count to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team who beat unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so that they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. increased resistance in the four - game games and won two matches but did not shrink them.
Jim Fuík’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend are called "Moliwood", are just the second pair in the history of the Ryderbeker who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a dad Woods and American newman Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5/4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he had now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did well during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 low for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--which is first and third on the world rankings.
On a pleasant day with a windy southwest of Paris, however, Europe did not always get their way.
Jordan Spieth who won a big tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-games after losing the first two wins.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a backwardness of four points when they enter the single game, even if Fuík's team just had to play equally to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After two days of being second best, however, they do not seem to be able to make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll definitely disarm one-sidedly without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions aggravated their mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea "has taken significant goodwill measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we see no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fabricated" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons that North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual action, his words seemed significant in that it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The percussion that can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are aggravating our mistrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader had called attention earlier in the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party were in this matter of destroying nuclear weapons South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea’s rockets would be aimed at the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "fire arrowman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "fully," praised Kim abundantly for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council Pjongig should reward for the steps they have taken.
But, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must be diligent and unstoppable until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has intensified sanctions against North Korea unanimously in an effort to have funding dried up for Pjongingen's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said that he would visit Pjongigang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later that he had made " ganglike demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also to take a core complex if the United States "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all his pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of study by working against coffee-driven 'night sessions'.
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep is--that surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, presented this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academically and athletically, as well as how they improve their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students had been taken seriously during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one department there is a picture of a dormitory room, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another department participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes is,' added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'studies all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in an starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of his classes.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and may cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga Conquers Gerrard’s Men
Rangers experienced another scarf of daycare when Dolly Menga's goal head got Steven Gerrard's uncoupled team a low of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February’s 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team had only given Gerrard its second defeat in 18 games as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga beat seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 who last week took a point of Hearts and he would have been in his hippies with the way his well-trained team smothered their opponents at each turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball ownership, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score after just two minutes when Menga’s first placement sent through Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle field player took his big shot.
A deep frizz by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only misshit at the rear end.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a criminal target at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a soft target head of Oviedo Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener may have been in the direction of play at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they have earned it, even if it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again didn't handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple roundup.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly of his strip drove to the block.
However, Livingstone continued to force the visitors to play just the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett, who had palmed long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow could enter far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE ARE TELLING ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you sit on these earphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's about cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robbers
vaccine learns immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, alteration of them in a laboratory
They can see a protein which is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who taught the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can see a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "driving the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a type of leukemia.
After his action on SNL, Kanye West began a pro-Trump mock speech, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was discharged in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an outstretched action in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would make himself available in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he performed a Make America Great-pet, he set out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the footage of West’s groaning was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him to get behind the platform about what he was wearing on his head.
"They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat up.'
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went forward, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to have the world move forward?
Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice a discharge from the audience and members of the SNL-roll distribution seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio became still."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rosary Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of TPUSA Conservation Group, Candace Turner, who vehemently said: "To one of the bravest spirits: DANKIE THAT YOU ARE RELIEF TO THE CARE."
But chatter programgass Karen Hunter has scolded West simply "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") whom I believe to accept and proclaim an ideology that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatter on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Fellow rhythmist, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and of course pale music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his heavyweight role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the macho hero’s stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he was 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his associate from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about doing some work on this issue.
'I personally feel fairly strongly about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we men learned as they grow up regarding the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like having this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also admitted that he would not take part in any of the Game of Thrones succession and successions when the series next summer comes to an end, for he says he is 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie maker and his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in the Emmy - crowned fantasy sex.
The couple married on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change of past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70 - 90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters sailed out Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislator's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party claimed that the accusations were made by "ultra-legal" experts and Web sites.
"Surely, lies and still detestable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, put by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the placements was related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is totally false and an absolute lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information, and security were put at risk because of this deceptive and false claim--was by no means responsible for leaking out this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly elicited online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial bears witness to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of seeming too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light Waters in the interim election from the pillows, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he whipped.
In her statement, Waters said that her office " notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Against review - fluou Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It's now traditional to look for Brexit in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English action comedy mockery franchises - which then started with Johnny English in 2003 and was further struggling with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will Tongue-in-the-kinds evenatire on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new launch event?
In any case, the unlucky Johnny English with his outbursts and rubber face has renewed his license to waste everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the mocked secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, had a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shoot from that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, leaving chaos behind him, who Atkinson had played at one time in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of IJ.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armory and briefly cut the bolts against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed but the humor feels rather dull and strangely superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now self-confidence comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English’s adversities are not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty--a deplorable little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a puffed-up and besieged character, who already has a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson does her utmost with this quasi-Teres May character but there is only a few in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy was put at risk, she should call someone out of his retirement.
And that means the baffling Johnny English himself, now on duty as a teacher at some fancy institution, but that gives lessons on how to be a secret agent from the record, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-like spy school.
Called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submariner, an allamamastic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
Thus the Batman and Robin are of all intents and purposes to waste everything in Her Majesty’s secret service entirely on duty again and come to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes under the perilous enchantment of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waitresses they set fire to a French restaurant, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English let loose pure anarchy when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's home.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as cute and lavish as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his justice?
Work denied that it planned a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution should be passed on to workers by giving off their extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that at the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers, it will 'fit'.
Changing to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy revision is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day work week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not endorsed by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesman of the Workers' Party said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to elaborate on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' at service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment since a workers' government can make deductions based on alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directors of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector businesses to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote over his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that had happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, indeed, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new change."
What is the World Civil Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Civil Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was the 12 - year - old Worldburger who was left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism"--people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Worldburger says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after having received over 4,700 Swiss from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions being taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his site that asks "what makes you think our extreme poverty can end?"
World burger answered: "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who perform in New York this year's event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use fleets for "blockage" to stop exports of Russian energy - Minister of Interior
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for investigating new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to take it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the waterways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't end up on the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the attendees of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit hunting that considered themselves the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran, and he noted that this was the same practice.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said as he referred to Russia as a "single-talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration officials, including America's President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Moscow's "prisoned."
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which would double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked opposition from Germany, which reconfirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the U.S. to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to stand as president in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president of the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November I will seriously consider standing before president."
Warren aired her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very critical of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a two-way Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should stand by 2020.
Eight-and-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator did not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe recording.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she had to stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea of being potentially supportive and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names considered to be possible by 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont’s Senator Bernie Sanders.
Pray said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump's convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son passes through, which he has been going through since he returned, I sympathize with other families who sense the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which we soldiers return," she said to an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault on a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district have submitted a friend-of-the-court order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions case lodged by the American Civil Liberal Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She said her mate 'and his violent gang members,' she mistreated, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced a large number of applicants for US asylum as nations facing in-depth problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appèlle) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence.
District Columbia's attorney general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "despite decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court-law.
Procurators further argued in the legal order that the policies that immigrants refuse access damage the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems — even all serious problems — that confront people around the world every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death rates double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly baffling.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her feverish baby boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, bring an ambulance's body.
Clean water is scarce."
Citizens have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for pervasive possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - scale quake, were overwhelmed.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who got a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's army hospital where patients are being treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the walls' ruins, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, adding that he and his family in the city were for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accused China of bullying with propaganda advertising
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the U.S. Embassy for China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid stake in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of mixing in the US Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that denied China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what US officials told Reuters, a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in an escalating trade war that has resulted in their price rounds on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory rates early in the trade war aimed at beating exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now making bullying worse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, a person will find very limited dissenting voices and will not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions the Chinese people have on China's troubling economic trajectory, giving that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers had shrunk from the offer to publish his article", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women’s voters for interim elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top Republicans stand at the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned analysts that they would see counter-reaction during the upcoming inter-elections, especially of women.
Emotions about this go up tremendously, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
He said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s call for an FBI investigation on the nibble would be enough to appease fierce voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, demonstrators "November is on their way!" thronged as they argued in the Senate entrance hall while the Republicans who chose the Justice Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newsstand.
"People said it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among wave-voice female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that sets out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-nominated, analysts said that if Republicans continue to confirm, they could follow a counter reaction.
"It was a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice or Kavanaugh being placed on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they dealt with her," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps to prefer Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But Americans seem a little divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a little more that the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely jogging during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s appeal, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, under oath before the Senate's Legal Committee, testified that Kavanaugh had attacked her at 17 years of age while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-nominated his genitals had revealed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980's.
The inventor of the worldwide web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the worldwide web, launches a starting business that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that is building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personally online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of activities, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and applicable skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing a total change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a placement on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Global Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World-wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am tremendously optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victorian Cuisine Contemplation
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victorian Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kool Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack at Bellenglice and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned achievement.
According to the London Gazette, lt. col. won on September 29, 1918, his battalion led across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through much dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he stormed a man-only gun and knocked out three of the ward.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I can never do, but something that is depressing."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people will give."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Pepa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the full - packed Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the fight, viewers in the UK were left silent when the cover changed to Pepa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fighting until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the children's cartoon as "one or the other sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content at 6 p.m. was unsuitable and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the re-send, I think we can probably work something out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six — as we normally make — and we have tried to offer more to our followers and have just passed over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has 'minority' feelings about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he gave his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that to have become a parent, he had less to care about winning at the Olympics.
The regular offerer of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months because of disease.
When he appeared as a reprieve on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day those feelings are less felt than, and feel otherwise, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something", he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and has used his appearance at this year's State Alliance in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he gave his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – " caught him inconceivable."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar-winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar high and low points.
The couple had become parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said she had changed "whole perspective."
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had been asked if they had tickets for London in 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Pa'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of for my life – to dive before my homecoming at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first songwriters — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in building up the Olympic Games and still giving him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and withdraw from Saturday's Ryderbeker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-seaters at the game.
Instead of being the focal point of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will divide his day in between to be a raspberry and work at the top of his game in the hope of correcting that shale.
Even at the height of his career he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the slim Le Golf National career where the long bush always punishes the erring blows.
And as if the track on its own is not challenging enough, Mickelson comes on Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Furich expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a knock on his back and put his arm around me and said he'll be right tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Heroes, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think that he would play two games.
I had more to offer, but that’s how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday for the player who has played most Ryderbeker matches.
It can mark the end of a Ryderbeker career that has never really corresponded to the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 beads, 20 defeats, and seven half, although Fury said that his presence contributed invaluable aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, likes to shave the fool, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the teamroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great progress can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage before the last day's single game in the Riderbeker can easily turn into an awkward experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail crabs with 1411⁄2-131⁄2.
"One keeps reminding yourself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scrap," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after he had watched the class of 2018 won 5-3 Friday and yesterday 10-6 before was at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going to full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice at how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never advance this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to pass on to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind and he must also get the best out of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Fureich would want his players to do better individually than they did as game mates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Fureich himself had already been on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wishing stake at Brookline before he had finished as a loser when Europe had achieved the "wonderful work of Medinah".
"I remember every mysterious word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke up his players on the way to that last day.
"We have tomorrow 12 important games, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We have set up our team by it, and have divided the men whom we have felt, you know, for us tomorrow will bring something magical."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and enter the main battle against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said about his single-game options.
Germany’s New Warship Set Off Again
The German army's latest frigate would have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, because of faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Kurant who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the fleet in 2014, but the troubling post delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order of air and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that by the time they enter service, the advanced warships — which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas — will already be called The Time.
Last year the disastrous F125 frigate made records when the German fleet officially refused to hire the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "sweetware and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Palatinate" are thought to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – has also become an issue.
It has apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have bitten the new frigates are particularly important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are getting up."
The official clerk said that the issue worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown langoor and Daubenton bats at Invereve Gardens in West Ross.
Special contractors will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert clan channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the bat calls and determine which species to do.
A Habitat card and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as grazing and how to best manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the place of sleep and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to point out bugs and obstacles to their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who perform regular surveying and sleeping - place inspections and sometimes carry out rescues.
The organization has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threeave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to search for bats for maintenance in property because it is possible that unknowing destruction of a single maternity home can mean the death of up to 400 females and young children and can eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them, or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations fare."
Ronaldo completes rape attacks while attorneys prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has canceled rape attacks against him as "false news" and said that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His attorneys are ready to sue German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus foreman was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, made the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "inadmissible report of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents lodged at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" an "good old" abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "fearing for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants now to reverse the arrangement because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will forever repent' if they lost their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Executive Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would have to stop temporary production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a no-contract-Brexit, items can cost.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears about leaving the EU without any agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said that they would lock their mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on an "just in time" basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there can be disruption on the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, said the company, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "acquired precisely to avoid those border checks."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the plant’s competitive position and eventually cost items.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for 24 years at Burnaston and the Unite Union's co-founder on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein can be postponed "with another week" while the fighting over nominated for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible cross-compliance with the right by the president.
Whether Trump is going to dismiss the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby threaten Mueller’s independence, has been firing Washington’s gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the account.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate court trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump continued a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said, "A date for that is not yet determined, it can be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press information session since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a ambiguity for TV journalists who are "effect hunting", although she said, "I won't argue with their impact hunting."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU personnel who worked in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the wish that they would remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed themselves to covering the cost of processed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified their preparations for a possible no-contract scenario.
I know it is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I prize each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he had contracted a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest time.
"He came to the margin and kind of just fell down there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there was "no more detail about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee still tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He took his death five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 barrels of death.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesourie expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa will announce May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to counter homelessness.
The extra charge — which is out of the present seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to rent — can be up to as many as three percent.
The Thesourie expects that this move can bring in up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London estates are bought by non-UK citizens who push up the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spoke villages" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding their property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to renounce kbotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "home disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no error settlements".
He also wants to give counsels larger powers to build new houses.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and want to build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as it is for foreign - based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland-operator Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to at some point become the manager of Scotland.
The Scots, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life into the North East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points among the uppers.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he had led St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I often watched as a child with my father to Scotland at Hampden and it is something that draws me back.
The occasion, however, can only come if I am successful with club sending."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
'At present, success will be measured for me by ''can I bring this club back to the Premier-liga?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross' career in management is still only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Hearts' senior staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and convert St Mirren from on the brink of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said as he reflected on how he took over Alloa's leadership.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, for I have done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come weekly.
I keep going through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can listen to the full interview on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Presented sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than the previous month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drankie-led drinking places and bars did far better and increased more than restaurants had dropped.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
All over managed bars and drinking places, sales rose by 6.6 percent for the month, with food being down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors in selling in the out-of-the-house market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year would be particularly difficult above and except constant expense.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-conducted operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened up, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowing down in trade - label exhibitions.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – has revealed a survey of secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
Participation of 20,000 high school students has revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news raised fears of putting sexual content in place
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – creates social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photography site Instagram.
The news raised fears of sexual content being placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also have private bills.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "ramp" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private bills.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot locate them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to vote for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after he had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, learned how to walk, and practice skillfully today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump ads that compare moms to cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company split opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the leading of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-cheese music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to moms that milk out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows at the size of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen it, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
The choir part reads: "Pomp it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, many who say it was underplaying the "grays" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
After we have to become pregnant and give them birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of their birth," wrote one.

Another remarked: "Absolutely traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming" for her.
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had breast - feeding.
To milk out made me feel just like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another remarked: "It's a nice advertisement aimed at moms who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cheet"
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is still, however, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a feeding bar that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out as they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother remarked: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a great and exhilarating introduction.
By moving a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in an entertaining way we found the wonderful sense of freedom to connect with that which the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has brought the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the treadmill for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at bail.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by taking action to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to file their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immmigration and customs maintenance, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to bail out unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Only 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more difficult to look at because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moulem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more who have been uprooted, is "almost over".
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said that the conditions were all right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for their "disregarding ironic fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascate these returnees," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just has to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement had a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live, defended.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear spear times" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN Secretary Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "examining the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals soon end his presidency.
In which without doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is at the top cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fair Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "For he makes me laugh," said I. Scovell to me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich plane jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris", The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, around, anatomy.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Shares he does that make it feel like a reality program, is that he feed you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily bangles in the plot (such as looking for argument with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to praise).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was watching MSNBC inside as he recorded CNN.
He could not tear himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outflow flows to the most exciting middle-term selection races in the House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th saw an influx of money, due to a shift of congressional districts that had now led two officials into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district leaves Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – measures powers.
Lamb opposes another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th launched with a campaign financing contest between the major parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Field Convention Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nail-crap win in a wide-spected special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. thought of punishing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then turning back
Diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already admitted Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the state departments have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "unlong decisions to no longer acknowledge Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in American aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up a similar convention last year considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence was now destined to address the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for administration, said the diplomats.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new strong messages or demands from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on the basis of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - beaming of the dish, which now has much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is believed to also focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia was in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress would change in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just when he was preparing to go before the voters again, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of axes, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to take up a coup against Hitler, if the West had just opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakian Slovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such turning points, and democracy’s relentless course is speeded up or slowed down.
Americans are now staring into the face of several such turning points.
What will we do as Mr. Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, absolves?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed taking the president secretly and speculating whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh's newly applied FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in the middle of the election for a convention that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we watch those tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who at one time lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to go in on the Sabbath candles on that table that carries the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic for Rapid Vienna Battle
Rangers play thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive drawout in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month they will place themselves in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season up to the 2-competition against Villarreal, but he believed Rangers could use this outcome as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, for Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is likely a just outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they've had a good result in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a good feeling-factor at the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children, ‘ You can’t prepare your family to care if you don’t express your wishes in advance. ’
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care fund decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles off the match.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, proxy for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unfit.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"These aren't just the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with a windshock
A man was shot several times with a windpockets when he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 BST, as an "equal act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officials could not obtain any information from Donggala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, over 16,000 people were brought to safety.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Donggala is a regent stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A Tsunami also struck west Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths off the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 circumference had hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-scale quake hit near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - scale quake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level quake hit the Pidie Jaya rectory in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly quake and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't this time lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that fell down,
2018: Great tremors strike Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with over 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took a female knowledge phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-examination facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocently, certainly" when there was asked what he pleaded, reported the network.
Palin faces three class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints were made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and owned a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior with PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds of died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-scale earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot hire car to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges bear possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury Saipov had charged with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crimes, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "delightful planning and preoccupation," said prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habiblaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," noted the intentional announcement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York judicially prosecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced for a plot to perform spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were decorated with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an native of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the persecution.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events to all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team used to ask persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP states that NIGL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Euroskeptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs proposed that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Concertative back banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that the UK by the time "would be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to unite her deep-divided officers was dictated by pro-Roman Toris by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track in the face of attacks by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Allys insisted that she press through in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels despite the downfall – and force Euroskeptics and Labor to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Loop Means Loop-Agreement in Solihull that he wanted to cut out Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he were in control, we would have been out by now,’ he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to cut out Chequers.'
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected proposals that public opinion have changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to rejoice is completely false.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkys was also on March and told reporters: ‘ I’m simply saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Farge told me that if the convention politicians wanted to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum, they would have to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold.
'It is now about a matter of trust between us--the people--and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it'.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s army of this country that has given our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they held a convention for two hours in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners as to the introduction of the group this weekend.
Workman Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application as the conference opened.
'That is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the unruly border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
‘This is a complete intelligence.
There's not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard at’ to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard at it to stand for president" as the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for reelection in November against GOP, states Rep Geoff Diehl who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that his Trump may be challenging by 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constitutives using the city hall format since Trump was in charge.
An accomplice asked her if she was planning to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and it includes a woman at the very top."
Arrested in Sniper Death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU bass player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 B.C.E. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally dead as a result," told Chief Murphy J. Paul of the media per 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, possessed of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 advances last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumping balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton makes world title after team commands gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive all the way back into traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes had found a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action which the Ferrari driver saw reluctantly risk-free left the inside at risk of delay to a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the runoff grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large portion of the race, as he held to his tires to finish quickly and to pass Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have come into the pits on the 44th rounds but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri performed fantastically all weekend and was a true sir.
The team did outstanding work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a dirty bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked at a convention at Senator Dianne Feinstein on her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "joint and rude and liars."
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it...No, we didn't leak it," he added, in a prelude to the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she had asked."
But the president did not regard her denial well and commented during Saturday's convention: "I tell you what. It was a dirty bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-nominated accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurts them, whom they have to surround to get power and control," said Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-point lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team up before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee equal before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen's purpose secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost matches and then won Friday night Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaulll aid, with David Rutherford who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.

Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an airplane that carried hundreds of people has taken off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake Friday struck the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in demolition in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gfäferan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to ascend safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he dayd that it tumbled together.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disasterdignity agency, which says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to increase since many dead bodies are still under the raids while many are still unattainable," said Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that had reached up to six feet [6 m], struck Palu who would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military service: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia had been struck by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after seashore plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was passing the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had entered very low.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through medium - deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the elephants panicked and shouted and that he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures working near the improvement of a wharf also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to get people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analysts set timeline for woman - burned evening
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from different cell phones that showed that Tellis was together the night of her death, in contradiction with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's truck, Sanford said he "jok, for my move was in Nashville."
Not a coincidence is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she was dead.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted his phone's messages, calls, and contact information.
"He sure did her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin its closing ceremony Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Not a black person?!
NEW nanny sues a couple for being fired to "racist" text
A New York children's lady laments a couple for discriminating dismissal after she has received a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was "no more a black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and liken the matter to "pressing."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, raised her dismay when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE NOW A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After she found out her mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired me Maurice and said that they were outgoing children's chagrin who was African American, did bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was originally appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turned back on the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s engagement and fear that after they insulted her, they would not be able to trust her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," told man Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "depressing" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to follow such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the legal case continued, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple onto social media and cut them off for their conduct and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It is very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bittersweet".
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an appellate man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success of that kind.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit for Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowing down and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't complain or scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been hurt by this time for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she had been appreciating.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got on the run an overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women mail maps to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising sheep with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he was dead, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I keep worrying that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence. You have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It snatched a hole through the family.
They tear us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still unquestionably as the FBI investigates.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked--a timeless investigation that had no bribe--could we bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under broken partial accumulation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The interim elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces his report?
There will be a poll in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea runner numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-sugar quoted data from the South’s unifiction cabinet and said that there were 1,127 raids last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers was key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The large majority of runners from the north are finally presented to South Korea's citizens.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the robbers to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically at war with each other, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that centered around the destructive negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries", says he is unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was temperamentally incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they'd say 'histerian'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and stabbed while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "noble and coordinated assassination of character", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony had proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unfit for those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at D.C. Ummegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable Sorg or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous diatrib, months and years' rage that boils, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I am angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permitted as a partial exit for brim because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman at my neck--a cold manager for whom I was a little afraid--that dragged me into a treportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they've had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an extramarital relationship on a boat named Monkey Business and he had to leave the racing, I was very frustrated by Schroeder, realizing that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snowy Little and the Seven Dwergies."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finds collectors, so she vowed that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her talk and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotion--thank you for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism--that she had stabbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press had responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate bail.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the U.S. China Trade War may be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China was deafening and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may in the long term be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, had fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new rates affecting $200 billion (£150 trillion) of items and effectively charged half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Every time, Beijing retaliated in good reprisals and recently dropped prices from five to ten percent on $60 trillion of American goods.
Shina has promised to equalize the US shot-by-shooting and the world’s largest economy will not soon move.
Getting Washington back means surrendering to requests, but publicly fulfilling the US requests would be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure on US trade war over the long-term Shina can positively support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic twelfth air can begin in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and appeals to help rebuild the land destroyed by war for more than seven years.
The Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions improve in the country.
"Today the situation at ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been fleeing the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat-lined land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had guaranteed the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and won Span U.S. with a final score of 16.5 at 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, let her have T-hou in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has sounded in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was exhaled by the lowest - ranking player on the European team Thorbjorn Oles van Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, has 2 and 1 case to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the torch over to his compatriot John Ram who won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 racetrack Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 great titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Spanish U.S.A. struggled all weekend to find the clean field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on his team's behalf: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we put a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hats off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat slanted.
We have been surpassed."
