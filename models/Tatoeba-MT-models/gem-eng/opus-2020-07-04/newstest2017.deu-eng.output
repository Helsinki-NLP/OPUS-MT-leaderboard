28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "At last he went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the forensics department in San Francisco announced.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia informed the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had spent six months as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was first living in hostels, but that, "the things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a great heart.
His way to connect with his family was to always cook us something to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this unscathed diamond that lighted brightly every day," he said.
Any person who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's contact phone under numbers 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview now inextricably clear.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or getting stuck from outside label, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to be perfect and successful."
"Truly said, these things are more of a trick to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is regarded as "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
In fact, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming a TV set with loose dutt and Mexican food, says the magazine.
They ask about the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game", Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a few colleagues sought a change with a beach ride.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-olds.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their celebration, they chased home to the lining troughs in the fast gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And with that the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was once again close to horses.
He was allowed to lead with his family over the arrangement of the ALRV, he didn't even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
For the first time, Langer was in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala.
The friendly athlete does not lack awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour-Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already saddled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sport Pyramid.
In Aachen he met Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social engagement."
Langer has been promoting young people for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The excellents include Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Push and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöle and the posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious society moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. Presidential candidates disagree with tax and energy policy as well as with a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lie at the root of a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He would be quite different himself, Trump claims.
He's going to go back massively, and he's making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and that it needs money.
That is why the taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they have to be invested.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by, for example, the Republican State-critical tea party wings.
So Trump could still have some in-house discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and raise coal production in the US again.
Oil promotion should also be possible in previously protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement would like to terminate.
Clinton, on the other hand, specifically wants to expand renewable energies with its investment program and asks: "A country will be the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in the case of infrastructure, but also in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both the US do not want to isolate from international trade - but just better protect American jobs.
They're supposed to be better paid, so it's Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine wage.
He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.
What Trump wants to do about this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must be raised, then he says he should not be changed.
But the great debate over the coming months is likely to be more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics believe that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby that is not more than a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stared at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the kid.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a social welfare service provider in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-flighted women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not as visitors either.
The exception is a guard outside the door.
"It is not exaggerating to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened by torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
For women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have made experience with sexual violence, coercion, honor killing, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what drives her away.
On the run, this goes on.
"The fact that a tug of water, for example, demands sexual action is not a rarity," Bahr says.
And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, is mistaken, Bahr tells.
Here, too, single women in refugee accommodation would often be considered inferior and, at worst, abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate it.
"Some of the children may not have been created voluntarily."
Many women were so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great".
Since they often did not know how to help, it takes more accommodation only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some reply with No.
There is no such thing in government accommodations in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example.
Even in Schwaben alone, fledgling women are not separately accommodated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Francs there are floors or private houses in some shared accommodation only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately."
"If there is a sense of privacy, or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can continue to occur."
In particular, washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be read at the town hall, which is located on the house in Munich.
"Since talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strikes assistant doctors: Demands for new work struggles
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new labour measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has asked its entire council to approve more work struggles from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns regarding the Treaty.
Assistants and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "restraintly calm" to problems, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and has called for formal renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work struggles beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors striking six times this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slimy and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restraining circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "loving friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day a newspaper described Erdogan’s behaviour as if something bad had never happened.
My enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But one of Putin's sustainable coolers showed that the head of state of Russia had not forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the firing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was inundated.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.
The crime was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Reconstructing vetrowing will be difficult if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He disputed this vehemently.
But in St. Petersburg it was official message that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could record a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly on hand.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he has been removed from his office at a failed state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be made easier when the flights are taken back up.
They are a late-seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it sees its reaction to the attempted seizure of power as a weak answer.
In addition, the continuing horror of the snug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is keen to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for demanding support for the elected government after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which has itself a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this magnificent palace on the seas enabled Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described to me an analyst, to portray "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that are moving away from the West and feel badly treated and are now interfering.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress it.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better for the two heads of state to speak again with each other at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Bank's Management Board, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected with the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has distanced itself when it had to be almost collapsed and rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with our customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers inside (we have asked)?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th prize at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays Champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit.
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British prize at Newmarket.
He placed a milestone on his local racetrack with his second win of the night, which is trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes up the cheer when he gets the victory on predication
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner, had 4.493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modernism and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 wins if he were not just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the label of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of major tournament winners, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and was banned.
Three years ago, he was in trouble when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not finished for a long time - Dettori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a Kremlin's opinion, Putin had "appointed Ivanov's release from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidal Administration without giving any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later the protocol manager and head of the government staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State in relation to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces persuading?
This step has made Moscow mystery arches.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time, working as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the country's most powerful men.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff would resign on his own request.
But despite the smile for the camera, few of them are convinced here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - has encountered great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidium for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up his post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday for announcing his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details such as Gibson's character from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played at the Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been present since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put in my whole heart's blood for the past twelve years," said Gibson in a announcement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be about sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, released on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 screech ropes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to leave the country on the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queen Ferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic proportion in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
In total, almost 79% of all bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today gets a betonus for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a rise of about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Good luck still to be alive"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty in swimming safely while their boat moved on with its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around near her and pictured the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones's rescue station manager.
"Unfortunately, the strong winds have already swept the boat beyond its reach until we water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all boarded the coast rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have lost happiness and still to be alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was loosened by the person who was steering the boat when the boat was being parked.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - man stands up to his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked and severely injured his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When he got into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-olds wanted to reassure their brother.
But she could not move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the husband's ex-husband.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens mean that investors will be much more involved in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose cheap apartments in the next few years almost 1300?
The SPD proposes a "conventional approach to housing" for the next Council meeting.
But fight is programmed.
First of all, who is to build cheap apartments?
So far, there has been a lack of regulation.
SPD Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments may also arise in the stock.
However, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU would like to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants even tough conditions for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market is beginning to tighten up.
If the action concept is implemented, it will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the professionals.
But the program is still not complete: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compare the loss of other around 1300 favourable apartments whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesman Nicole Palm, now expired bonds should be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into price keeping.
This is possible in the west city.
At one point, the problem could be solved.
Because in the West City, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments can be brought back to price fixing for cheap apartments.
Just: That's what the owners don't want, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social housing units in the west city is again drastically increased, one is removed from the goal of so-called permeation.
There should be no concentration of socially weak people in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
They have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a pursuit of health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teens and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on screen was initially on TV, then on video games and lastly limited to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities outdoors do not exclude each other.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
How many phenomena of pop culture dropped interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons who are tracked by a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (with a screenshot on the phone) or "caught".
A generation who played the game when she was even younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person takes back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed people who are training 30 minutes each day ran from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from sofa" and "be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages are boring about health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to mention here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun to them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are also maurial game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
It's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will be left with time.
Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the ladies' tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamically on the jumping horse.
It's easy on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, also an Olympian.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament climbed for a multi-game title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and final five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Alyya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles is on the hoverbar during the single multi-camp finals of women in the art tournaments at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-game title and in total the fifth, as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.
This success makes it the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympian Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between them and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the Spring family with a handful of gold, Texas, would have been considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugged each other after winning gold and silver in the single competition finals of women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles brought the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Some of her ground exercises - which contain her typical Tumble Pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became powerful.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any more competition, a victory series that will last as long as it wants Biles.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was wrong.
Sweeping beams and ground towers - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurk.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the hover bar - and put another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman gently hugged her as she expected her finality - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Bile's shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As far as Biles is concerned, the fast-moving 19-year-old tweet of the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killers shot in the car while listening to music
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who had been killed in one of the most lethal attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police announced that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven persons were killed in nine attacks in hispanic residential areas within four months and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed it was the work of the serial killer.
Detectives found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It gets better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microcephaly has the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't like that.
What's not right at all -- of course one has agreed to it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose to institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people still do'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with a walking aid.
Edmund could not sit or crawl until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can walk with support and cycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented for "Please sing me something."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it is not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto is reminiscent of the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis in a long time because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. More rains are expected all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help to the communities concerned is already on the move.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparationness, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in south Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it apparent that in this area an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood alarm system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Committee near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as it will flow slowly over the rivers passing through Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00 am.
Rescue teams were still plucking people out of the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose heavily overnight.
He said that he was warned by another stepson who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water poured in and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife, Hansford, said that during the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a rise in the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that Emergency Aiders had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they had been accommodated by Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "extended quickly" as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities were delaying evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported rain from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the soil has been heavily watered by the rainfalls.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a deputy in Tangipahoa listed 200 houses flooded.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches that were now flooded.
The head of the community Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by floodwaters.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was established to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to floods and sandbags were provided for residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no one has been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Smoothed by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week, already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered multiple gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious of his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the transmitter that he is expected to recover.
He should have started his first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men could be among the perpetrators.
Detectives told CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a crossfire between several shooters.
Smurf rifle shells that were traced back to various storm rifles overlooked the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, were hills.
There seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very active," police man Anthony Ginaldi told the police in Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm talking about among the women's Olympics in the tournament, and that's for more than one reason.
First, I have been with every summer Olympic since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has consolidated the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female female tournaments has been an African American.
Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2 last year.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympics Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was cheering.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual competition event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is how tournament classes do not look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all made the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But reality seems to be such that tournaments are an expensive sport and tournaments are primarily held in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents for the training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coaches and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued at any time.
The majority of these tournaments lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the Turners receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to enable the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to perform a quieter and easier-to-access gymnastics.
I founded my 20-year gymnasium.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Tours develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by bringing the Olympic team gold and thanking her, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to begin their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the staff of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in one election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to force the contract to enter into force and said that the NHS was in a "no man's land" and any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night work and weekend work to improve care for young people.
Last night, Dr Ellen McCourt, the Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians announced in a communication: "Assistants still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it is heating the current workforce crisis and that it will fail to deal with all doctors justly."
With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress has to be made and time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through discussions have led the government to take part in reluctance and sometimes to a deafening silence.
That was the promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work measures.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a delay of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialist doctors were involved to provide cover for doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggle measures do not reach any of the few, but are already strained by overburdened teams and service providers, and only cause anxiety, distress and interruption to the patients, caregivers and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to the concerns of the Ministry of Health and other ministries about the prejudice and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health as regards compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after it has been recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.
The inhibitory medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The regulatory authority NICE of NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The regulatory authority NICE of NHS has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fat-containing material in the artery walls that form surfaces.
When the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clot the blood flow into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft instructions published today by NICE recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of a person’s life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions do not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Political correctness culture makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlet's Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the knowingly ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities as revealed today by a devastating government report.
Former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and town halls to ignore evidence of abuse of election due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anticorruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up barriers outside electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID with them in order to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, only a voter has to name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on the fingers of a person when they give their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to counter electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet Wahlkandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court decided that the occupying mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic phobias.
Rahman is said to have " led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He was particularly alarming at the fraudulent election of letters - when older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including leading demonstrators to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence has been provided that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose, in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshic backgrounds.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter-picking documents to stop "learned".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as it has delivered its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person shall be carried out to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limitation on applications for automatic lettering.
Prohibition of political activists to process complete correspondence and envelopes of correspondence.
The police have the power to set up locks on electoral stations.
A legislative amendment which facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksvertretungsgesetz 1983).
Photographer ban in polling stations.
Requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "unbelievable" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal charges were filed.
"Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices declared Lutfur Rahman to be unsuitable," he said.
Due to a number of reasons, he was known guilty of being sufficiently guilty - in accordance with the high standards in criminal proceedings.
He also criticises the impeccable "departure controls" of the election registration departments of town halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as Parliament's mother, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist double gangster and other famous double gangsters of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have been taken over by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duke of Cambridge this week.
But the 24-year-old Olympic artist is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold who has his own famous double gangsters - at least not if you are allowed to give faith to the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison, left, is compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's doppelganger on the track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter, after pictures he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got mad in the social media and admitted that he has already been told since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great resemblance myself, except for facial hair," said Brady of the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm sure I'll take it as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more on this year: the striking resemblance between British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gang higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another continuous comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, which has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallion swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-brown skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Footballstar Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in space: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which shows her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m free-style swimsaw upset viewers of the CBC live transmission of the Olympic games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize, after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "like Mief went off" and during the race "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swing.
MacDonald, who had been taken aboard the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Spectators in all of Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead like a pig"?????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle sponge stack for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost its connection, baby."
The critique against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many people were talking to him.
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angered.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance being broadcast."
It was an unfortunate wording, we are sorry it happened."
In the end, CBC apologized for more than 90 times to the people who responded to the comment about Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and released a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made available for broadcasting.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers for their broadcast and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate wording. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized to the show and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimsuit in the CBC Olympics, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark indignant about woman who tried shameless underwear in the middle of the shop
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out, and laid it back into the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before she put them back in the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the exhibition, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty as Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underpants that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, attracted herself and went out.
"She didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might have bought the underpants she had tried."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home who was wearing another person and who was not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I said, employees have tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had them and went out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9 in our Folkstone branch."
All products in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the Maga League in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
If you approach from the back, you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "get out of the line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the heel and twist while the attacker cuddles with pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him with the loop into his face and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of its grip before they move backwards and point the gun to it.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it is Mizrachi.
But remember, it's safest in a robbery to hand over your money, unless you're a Grand Master Krav Maga.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveller subjected his immune system and strangler reflex to a serious test - by lurching some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scraped his move on a Euro-skin, a railman at Piccadilly Circus, a sinking button of a tow toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to let in.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of leaking the sink of a tow toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repellent, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.
Luckily, nothing left behind what he wanked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task definitely placed its immune system under a test
In the film he said: "Already as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was definitely satisfied with his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample strip showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to leak after her luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I smelled in a toilet, close to."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna look at anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company supports Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President of snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We went through crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilets shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to bring Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we filmed some of these dirty delicacies."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria surveyed were associated with the well-being of stomachs and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left her social apartment after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clasping holes, wooden pieces were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was embroidered on the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repairable.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, since this property is probably not considered as such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease contract, got an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be torn off, old garbage was found
In the area where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing delogistized her and her partner this week violently from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
Delogation was hailed by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anybody."
We lived next to them 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the municipal house were garbage and old toys thrown down
He added:"It is a shame that the tenant neglected to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and that of her family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrified for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and gave us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the house's bedrooms after delogizing on the ground
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear up garbage mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had confessed to possession of a Class B drug in the interests of trade.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house walls were embellished with graffiti.
The police say she'll delogist tenants who don't comply with the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police announced that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-proclaims, as well as to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military jet flooded the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft from the air forces made an incredible crash flight
Air Forces claimed that there was a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in tangible proximity over sunbathing on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers sprang up when they understoodably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines, without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flew
The Portuguese air forces today reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visibility of the jet, the nearby surface fires flew a little deeper than usual, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time compromised.
Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people were killed on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces stated today that the pilot had to fly so deep, due to the conditions of heavy fog and fire smoke, which restricted his view.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to win the title in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel around the Spanish Supercup against FC Seville, and the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must give up Neymar with the inferior Cup finalist and Europe-League-champion among others, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
In training, the German suffers a narrowing of the knee, which at least explains the one question at Barca in the first place in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for the status of number one in Barcelona for two years.
In this regard, Coach Luis Enrique did not make a clear decision so far, leaving Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts at the Spanish master about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
At 3:2 in the trial run against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced yet.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona has been a record winner with eleven successes in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympian.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and champion Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final.
With this, the world rankings first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final game as expected and formed the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the highest Olympic trip was the former SWS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Mom and Zhang were left alone on the plate, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the Tribunes and let their shooters loose on their own in the fair competition.
"I've been playing the matches up here for my country."
"I play for me in the finale," Zhang said.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he determined the speed at the plate and left Zhang there only a total of 13 points.
As a result of Ma's superiority, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were plenty of stunning ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter finals, the White Rouss had contracted a rib injury against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, after which he was in medical treatment, had to "satisfied" with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympia Four in similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump clears up the huge problems of the election campaign.
The leadership of the US Republicans is plagued by massive concerns, including in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the previous Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment, in which the usually large-scale and self-confident multimillionaire expressed concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump in front of evangelical Christians, who asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He took back his well-known media records of his candidacy.
Wackling of Republican high castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his rivals from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were at the same time.
Other institutions do, however, foresee Trump’s absence, which is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview of the stationer CNBC Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton again: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And push behind: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday".
He's doing nothing but "telling the truth."
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that is all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is said to have threatened to scrap funds in support of its election campaign, should it not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for Congress are more likely to be placed under their control.
Olympia: Third scam at doping test
The IOC wants to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
After the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Kenya's athlete threatens Unemach.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee informed that a Disciplinary Commission should be set up immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had issued a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported by the Doping controllers to Kenya's team leader.
The IAAF World Association has asked the IOC for information on the case to try its own investigations, an IAAF speaker announced.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation", said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and has spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, passed the sample and signed it," said Kenya's chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 metres in 2015 in Beijing WM-Vierter.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan athletics delegation leader Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed sportsmen of his country's upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time following numerous doping procedures.
In announcing the IOC's more than 2000 doping target controls prior to the Rio games, it was said uncommonly before that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular will be taken into view.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-Doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by the ARD, accusations have been made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently asked for a similar study in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was demonstrated that this sport was widely and systematically baptised.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Lornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classicalism and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he warms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love for Tony with sadness, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at the time the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London Schoolgirl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's Bollwerk in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - preventing people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London entered a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain in the event of a election victory at Garland as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Judge to the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, being Lakas and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the president's office.
Treats wants nacktkalendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a Pirelli-inspired calendar in the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine was distinguished from Oldschool-Playboys as "Playboy for Men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does too.
"We must return to the depiction of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release for the release of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass flight
"Whoever does not adjust and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nigh Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a hundred thousand", believes the president of the association Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, medium term with a few hundred thousand seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and democratic opposition," says President Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already committed criminal acts to Kurdish castles months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
After the spoiled coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added.
Many people in Europe will want to start over if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that absorbs its own refugees produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The chief of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or displaced in the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of the Federation demanded that the Federal Government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionals.
The branding as a Gülen trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-nigh Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks put the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany already before the coup.
As of June 30, this was 11.386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all people who were eligible for asylum (39.625).
In this survey there are not those who fled before war, poverty, or lack of perspective.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the Landtag elections will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't sucker than it has been so far: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on vacation.
Most holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country day.
There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, blow balloons up, distribute flyers, and ultimately count out voices are just trying to drive them up.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let election campaign pass just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Exciting is how strong Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one looks off his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it did his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel blames Merkel for the flowering of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to fight at the right place at the wrong time.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large exposures; Merkel Bundestagswaltzkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But there is no harm in listening to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely refrains from the usual electoral struggles in marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with parasols and balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you are breaking the ground that it has to make a lot of effort to find another wire for the people.
It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vastness of the country hardly available.
The advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his rivals, however, is also self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village parties, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last behind Partner CDU (25) with 22 percent and only just ahead of the AfD (19).
At the 2011 elections, the SPD had won with 35.6 percent prior to the CDU (22).
The Green Party, with seven percent in the polls, is expected to jump into the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday note and largely place their election campaign on the Internet.
"Online-Wahlkampf", it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is turning straight through the mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Your impression: "Walk holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-Renovation: Restaurants suffer from obstruction
At the speed with which the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to meckern.
There is praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only around 8 p.m.
"They've made everything pretty stupid," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet power station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved south at the beginning of the week to the mid-term until the end of October.
It also praises the presence of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief rides.
Since the construction site has changed on Monday to the south and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has thus been restored, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
Citizens can now move both sides of the B 27 from many things.
The distance traffic through the place seems to go down.
"There were, in part, significant complaints", said the Deputy Chief Executive, Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The inhabitants of Bachsetzegstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weijerrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneezing roads were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.
As a result, some trucks were found to be in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant violations," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There's been a flash of two to three per minute.
The fastest was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at B 27 it is only a small comfort that the road is now open to customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like to look in the cards.
But that the B 27-renovation has led to revenue breaks, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the renovation has few consequences.
Also at the Maier car house Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highly slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running skills are missing".
The most affected are the local along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, once Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have "hit" it.
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro's turnover.
The loss of turnover is due to "over 50 percent".
The road refurbishment has "returned" its operations for about two years.
Half his employees had to let him go.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, on a request from Göhner, President Jörg Schmidt answered whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts where something more generous was handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, and it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less frequent because of the complicated transportation.
If you can't drive home, it's nice somewhere else.
That his regular clients return after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner maintains the impact of B 27 building work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being ensnared.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now presenting a large security package.
But what does a shielding status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the connoisseur.
All of his proposals were "politically reasonable to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new security package.
You don't exaggerate anyone.
Other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties.
I'm also taking part in that.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was based on results and on a "targetable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are all the more likely to do so.
Some things are already known, announced, planned: that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities also does not come as a surprise.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to penalise sympathy for terrorist groups, and double-bourgeois jihadists to break down the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU-Man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
They have it in part: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more opportunities for the arrest of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically picked up in the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and social media accounts opened for security checks.
In case of disguises for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally sensitive.
Some also seem unanswered and leave questions open.
And on a number of points - for example, in the treatment of the guilty - the question arises: what does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people were deeply concerned about were not allowed to stand out in election times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in the field of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
Only a frenzied dispute about the federal police's equipment, then about a security-political idea collection of some of the Union's interior ministers, in which the head of the department also calls for a ban on Burka and a renunciation of double citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling for reconciled sounds.
He didn't hold anything off a double pass.
We have completed the discussion in Germany.
Re-open them, don't make sense.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "predictable" for the coalition partner, it must first be shown.
There's a lot in there that could cause controversy.
However, even the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel sends a cautious message of willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further".
Volkswagen is still coming through.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets.
In the recall action, there is swirl around a term.
Volkswagen starts with deliveries of behavers in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest car builder has been able to show a further increase in its many brands and some well-running markets, despite the diesel trades in the past year.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus burdened the total sales, as the company listed in Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars in July than in the previous month with 449100 cars worldwide.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly back to two days less in Europe.
Furthermore, in some core markets, there has been a "changed economic environment" of purchasing restraint.
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempt at coups in Turkey, the British vote has also called for the withdrawal of the EU, a spokesperson explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas business first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main affected house brand of the Lower Saxony comes anyway gliding through the Diesel Canal: After the first seven months, only 0.9 percent drop-out to 3.37 million vehicles.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to show a further increase in sales.
1.3 percent more cars delivered by Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests using a software.
VW alone calls about 2.5 million cars to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.
There is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the retrofitting of vehicles.
After the upgrade, the car builder issue a "guarantee equal" certificate to the customer, but do not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason was legal fineness.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee for retrofitted diesel models.
This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
It was confirmed from the Ministry of Transport that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigative commission and KBA."
"Deviations of this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the upgrade and all vehicle type-approval-related values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not as it was in corporate circles.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility of customers coming to a workshop, for example, six months after the upgrade, for example, with a motor damage, and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid that, in the event of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is an uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
In the future, the Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to be penalised - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily money accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would have to "not be afraid to pay for their savings-gross penalty".
Deposits Banks Money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4% penalty rate.
This fee will be charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards to private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding for some time 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down 4000 euros for every million."
He is now continuing to pay the costs in accordance with the polluter-pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I don't want the fifth one!" said the bank manager.
Most customers understood and switched to other forms of investment.
Few emigrated to other banks.
The cooperative association Bayern stated: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone is "unsustainable economically".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or credit transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its Skatbank's 2014 portfolio, had made headlines with penalties for deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, chief manager of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay comprehensively for deposits, for this the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong".
A banker said that at Lake Tegern "there's a client who's a little more sophisticated with his wealth."
"This can be a problem for a small bank if it keeps money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
There are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the region.
The cooperative association Bayern "no other banks are currently known to charge a dividend for deposits of private customers," said spokesperson Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go negatively towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the emigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love records.
Before you rush to comment part to overlook him under the pseudonym NotAllEinseMänseMänslerenAlders with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widely spoken resurrection of records is not due to a boom in Millennials that wants to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are all likely to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you vote for the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on television, the camera would follow me as I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wildly before I stand still, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing weight to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent vendors were established - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialties.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of men: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is a day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), strip off the walls of his living room.
The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and ploughed.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hippe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to see to buy their old records again.
In general, people have left their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the adherents of the plate revival of a particular age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Ponica to recognize that record business offers a soothing community of like-minded.
According to Wez, some of the older customers began the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from items that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I do as a collector, and I think it's like that with many people.
It is a simple way to engage spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" one employee floats from a stack of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month haven't heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% owns a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very concerned, as I leaf through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages), has noticed a "trophe aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More prolific, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a colourful audience as I go in.
There are pairs around 70, tourists taking photos, teen boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity with the customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in the shop looking at the variety of plates for sale.
It's more like a window bump than a big purchase.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records isn't a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a beloved sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to pattern the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "platten art".
But given that each attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the deep sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not consider, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street's record business and leaves through records while avoiding the stark gaze of an inconvenient, 30-year-old false moderator who does not rise above the shoulders of men of middle age.
The Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied sharks, says that the record was in a female, from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court refuses offer via demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to tear down 72 provisional shops in which persons inside the warehouse sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also explained that provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operated the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the low tear was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was "for these children a disaster of which the last eight years are old."
On Friday, the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrant estimated that the number of people living in jungle valleys had risen to over 9,000 - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia’s disappointment: Martin remains militant
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep looking at the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday's time trial," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace the reasons for the debacle.
Martin wanted to compete for the title at the time-run World Cup in Qatar in October.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the last few years."
"To do this also counts my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54,5 km on the Olympian Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund and misses semifinals
The victory of Laura Sieggemund ended in the quarter finale of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed out by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Sieggemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to carry out her collar only once and worked powerless compared to the previous laps.
On Thursday, Medallenhoffnung Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met with the Briton Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had taken a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter finals of summer games had been released in 1992.
Never before was a German duo in an Olympic single half final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the takeover Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam started his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and present enemies as well as equipment.
The active player Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event should help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already paying attention.
The employees of the start-up, which has been based in Seattle, Washington, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamedi reported.
Therefore, nothing should change for the customers due to the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch had been purchased by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is a member of the Google-Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Forcement Trailer
Germany's shaver has to adjust to the next generation speedometers: in various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices will be tested, which are intended to transmit speed probes particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used at major accident points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway construction sites or to renovate bridges with temporary speed limits in order to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or too elaborate.
The Forcement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days at continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans after time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily cleaned, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and, by the way, also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning system from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to information from Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: Jongst has reordered France 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7th rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
Great Britain's impressive performance at the 7th Rugby final came to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji on Thursday night when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, retreading, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on her in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind him.
Eight years ago, she lost to Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens.
This is where they lost only one.
This slap will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderful and made the attacks of GBs burst out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were walking in moving buses. World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau was overheard in the corner.
With an additional four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai launched another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A great tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it stopped Fiji only.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the re-appeal and there was still over a minute of play time... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou pushed through further weak tackles of the GB team and rushed up to the line to make a goal.
The transformation brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning about it.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the mid-term and closed the Fijian gap...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Seesulates, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Vilame set the i-tub box with another test in the last seconds.
The whistle blew, the Fijis hugged, and the GB slammed in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a short semi-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackle by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the winnings - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer for rowing victory
There won't be any emotional gold as in these games, and that's what it's gonna be.
From the first rowing blow to the last, 220 hard sharks entering history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who were sitting on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the coach Robin Williams was everywhere when they rode the second Olympic gold in a row without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport who set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference, and there was no one more capable than the coach who didn't know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was a risky guy.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that's what she did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
The rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking with it a little more than usual and thus tried to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the chief of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. It might be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we're no one, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't going to do something great.
We didn't want any fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time off for a year before making decisions about his future.
Glover must appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic singer.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association "Vitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "preparable".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution from Bayerische Rundfunk.
Soon afterward, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "premeditated" in Bavaria.
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zünzelverband Employees, of which 28 years as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, annually supports about 150,000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed waterguard in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zünzelverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no stopping and there have been repeated innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service for more than 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the Water Forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel's waterguard, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a loyal button.
We were an unbeatable team together.
As high points from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a 3rd January.
Here will have to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages can be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn has been maintained only once because one filled the high tank of Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the drinking water destination association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who joined Rupert Göller's successor.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicalism has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was known to her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the now eight - year - old Tiago has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that is two years away when I sang at the Scala Milanese, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots at lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner on Friday at 10.45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called and said to have shot his partner," said a police officer.
The perpetrator is on the run, and after him is publicly imprisoned.
Meanwhile, nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brownish-burned and has a smoothness.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a smoothness.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110.
The police speak of a "relationship state".
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information about the Tathergang or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that a human being had been killed.
"It's a killing act."
"We don't say more at the moment," said one police officer in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special deployment command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of dollars.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from eco-power promotion are off the table.
It remains during the liberation from the renewable energy storage of existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, states Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad that after two years of tough negotiations we were finally able to achieve this."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to use gas from the blast furnace for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a consensus of principle with the EU Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEC revenue of 20 percent come up.
But these too are not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission on the production of electricity.
This largely sets the status quo of the previous scheme.
The successful efforts of Gabriel in the steel industry are particularly important.
"With regard to our campaign 'steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as China's world's largest producer country threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weak domestic demand.
European producers are imposing price dumping on Chinese steel companies.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, customs duties imposed on imports on imports have had effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have become brighter.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have rather stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.
They produced roughly six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased in the second month in succession.
Since the beginning of the year, production has fallen by two percent year-on-year.
In the coming months, the Association expects an improved order situation with an increasing outburst.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching school she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can make and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To stop and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be strenuous in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly ask for your lungs, you won't get away so quickly in your everyday life.
Even when it comes to obtaining the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby.
In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations the common singing had a much higher importance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs brings many memories to older people, often connected with positive feelings of her youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people who are suffering from heartache begin to think of long past events.
When singing, the head is also required to have a special performance, Lenz explains.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond myself - strengthen this experience.
So there's plenty of good reasons to start singing.
If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes there?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesial choir can turn directly to the church or to the head of the church.
Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in Internet research.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats more sensitive than cats react to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen also didn't let the males go cold - but they were always the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies at the Miauen of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens, who imagine themselves in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found out.
Although cat also reacts to the calls of kittens - however always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the Miauen of smaller and heavily excited young animals for the males are either unobservable or irrelevant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published in the BMC Evolutionary Biology magazine this Friday.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kits screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
Nine adult cats and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.
They were played out for the first time by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were additionally raised.
Despite the small sample, the researchers believe their results to be meaningful.
"All the females, even those who had not yet had their own offspring, responded differentiatedly to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned to the speaker faster when this shout of the very excited kitten played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said biologist.
In the past, scientists have examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grasps with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Süküri.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football game will take place in Turkey.
Prior to the duel of the archrivals between Besichtas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly indicated: "Business as usual".
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the insurrection attempt in July, the government insisted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which one makes responsible for the coup attempt.
There is also no stopping before football.
The prosecutors issued a warrant against the former Starkicker Hakan Süküri.
Thus, the now American Sukür is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukür is supposed to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup trial by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks.
The nocturnal "democracy wakes" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan finished on Wednesday.
Sports - like the whole country - are divided into followers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially the fans of the Besidas Workers Club are traditionally not among the President's friends.
But what the Turks agree with in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There are even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or vistas.
In the case of Pokal victor "Gala" it will especially arrive again at Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneer proved his sporting value in the past season: with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 win match.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him up: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciled finish.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the "Löwen" also broke out early in the Europa League.
==References====External links==
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besichtas the game year ran better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season champions as Süper-Lig-Torschützen.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez loaned by the AC Florence contract and the Gomez loan had only announced after the coup, not to return to the country because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the professional magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
But the storm would have to be ready to give up about a third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been closed twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred athletics probes can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme doping still determines the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had filed for the game shortly before the start of the game after a doping lock, was mercilessly plucked and bulged at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a bizarre scene: with a smile on her face, she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When they found out they weren't going to get gold, the audience broke out in a jubilant tower.
But there are many more athletes who, despite Doping’s past, start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He had already been locked up twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic Champion and Ex-World Champion have run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit off a six-month lock in 2010 after she was shown to take Oxycodon painkiller.
After surgery, she had severe dental pain, and the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion, was tested positively for the prohibited stimulant medium of methylhexanamine from 2010 to 2016.
Perkovic denied the scientific intake and was shut down for six months.
The four biggest dice this year go to the account of the great gold favourites.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympian and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months were blocked.
A remedy for penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt insisted.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly an athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he found testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia Silver 2004 for steroid baptisms and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games because of a judgment of the International Sport Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, it is ranked two in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record driver and gold favourite was not tested positively until May, but may still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of the intake of a prohibited food supplement was found, the barrier of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and ran out on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
They have suffered cut wounds and have been treated in the hospital, but they have been able to leave this again.
She planned her way home for the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday evenings in an exploding quarter.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two more explosives went up again, according to the authorities another man was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
At the detonation near Patong beach popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured according to police statements.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives were blown into the air in a flower beet in front of the coast police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
It's called a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists.
"We assume this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it was about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said one speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities had received secret services for upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police pointed out to their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace used by King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
Following the explosions of bombs, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on its homepage, recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applied to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
Following discussions between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, no necessary travel in these provinces is recommended.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applied to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence over the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to cause chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, benefits itself to have restored the kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to deal with the insurrection of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Just about a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu novel - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.
The right "Identitarian movement" has become a visitor to the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the constitutional guardians in the Federal Republic have also placed the group under observation.
"We see the 'Identitarian Movement' as evidence of efforts against the free democratic fundamental order," said President Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are decimated in an extremist manner.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is opposed to "multiculti delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of one's own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "Identitarians".
It must have been said that his authority had voted closely with the State Offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of state protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often using poppy music.
Islamists and right-wing extremists did that.
That's not an expensive advertisement for your own business.
Propaganda is supposed to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Finally, there had been reports from several federal states about "identitarian" contacts with AfD politicians.
Maaten said he doesn't have any knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
Depending on whether the party, in this case the AfD, changes its target direction by certain people who are extremist, and so becomes extremist.
So it is crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is unrecognizable.
In view of the marked increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have noted in recent years that there can be right-terroritorial structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, on refugee homes or on attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide control of right-wing terrorism is unrecognizable.
The existing groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Concerned about the fact that many attacks were on the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the perpetrators of attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals, or followers of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or left, who have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet Hit
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight ethiopia swimmers were so slow that he could not be seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Hatte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old with a 48-second lag, finished his career and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming club.
This is distributed to make swimming in under-represented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte prepares for the big race.
Quickly the first names made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard leaf "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him, based on a "constancy belly".
His time, he first hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the race of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
The swimmer's appearance from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to appear alone in a prelude over 100 metres of freestyle.
Frenetisch was cheered at Moussambani at the time.
The 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial ceiling in DTLA gets a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been bribed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old hermit had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and had forgotten to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned about 8.15 a.m. the next morning, about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is no video surveillance either.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat as tight as that
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there's nothing going to be with the U.S. President's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, he would not mind: "It's going to work either, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV channel CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
He called the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, however, more and more resistance was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is obviously great.
The post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The Group is about to start trading with the transporter.
The post also wants to offer its electric transporters from next year on the free car market.
"We want to get into sales to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been testing for months whether to sell its own StreetScooter, with letters and packages, to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated requests, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group is about to join the mass production of the vehicles.
In its own production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would like to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long term it would be a complete switch to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's roads since 2014.
GfK management takes place after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its head Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of GfK's market research company suggested that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann is all the more uncertain the longer the successes promised by him remain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After resuscitation of disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of corporate governance, the world number five of the industry is facing a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, has already resigned from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Management Board already took over the former CEO Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company announced.
He is officially supposed to assume the role of a "Chairman" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" to long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to mention a corporate speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that shareholders were last to be disappointed by the continued successes of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will at some point become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, that would be what the quantum would do," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss even in the second quarter of 2016 following setbacks in the previous quarters.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721.2 million euros.
Profits in the second quarter have particularly affected the company's declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of EUR 139 million required in the Consumer Experience division provided the Group with a loss of EUR 148.2 million under the strike.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated another consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - bus slips in crumb corners in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident in a coach with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Arich County) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to waive her information as a result of a counter-trafficking truck that was partly on the opposite track.
The bus came to the right from the road and slipped into a ditch, as a spokesman of the police department Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus themselves," she said.
The fire brigade freed the inmates.
Six ambulances and one emergency car came to the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The unharmed travelers were taken from a regular bus back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of wastewater are EUR 3,44 per cubic metre from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl sewage plant instead of EUR 2,10 up to now; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp EUR 3,36 (up to 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf EUR 3,64 (up to 2,18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, waste water charges will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the County Council of Kulmbach, it was found that cover for these sewage plants occurred.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner on the basis of legal bases.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and business and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the purse.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater treatment plants of the market community was necessary.
During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period would also be compensated.
Schmidt explained that all three sewage plants had relatively small facilities with a very low waste water accident, between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, spending on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the waste water supply in all three plants was slightly declining.
Furthermore, during the previous calculation period, all three plants had a significant impact not least on their age of renovation and repair costs.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf wastewater system.
In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the nearly 20-year-old conveyors had to be overtaken from scratch and, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage treatment plant had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation facility installed in order to comply with the water legislation requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses came from the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small waste water attack in the three plants the costs for the operation and maintenance "fully pass through".
Schmidt added that during the last 20 years, the market community had been spared considerable cost of maintenance at the wastewater treatment plants.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the plants mentioned above will continue to remain precarious, especially since these plants could not be extended to the water supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water treatment association because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
Annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders on absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy light stone.
The filters are unblemished, characteristic distorting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misconceptions come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past, where they were accused of promoting or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sloth eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face".
They wondered if these repeated controversys pointed to a major problem that the company had a diversity.
The news and the insurrection were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was considered a tribute to Anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced rassissmus remembered the filter of injuring clichés.
Others strongly rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and mildly said unpleasant."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the opposite of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-visible, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the devalued extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural strand.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, others asked to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview, she said that she believed that racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They either don't have a variety of representations of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company publishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company has recently hired a human resource manager, focusing on under-represented groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said to her that she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that it is not OK."
Military management falsify ISIS secret service information, establishes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, reported a Congress investigation committee in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican Armed Forces, Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News-service information, typically rejected by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of the American efforts to combat terrorism than it would have permitted on-the-spot conditions and were consistently more positive than the analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the US efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the Congress were much more positive than they were", the report stated.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the news service reports to lower the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being played to them that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports into the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of reporting services assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the High-Level Democrats in the Committee, a member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "deferred the publication of news service reports", damaged morals among analysts and "given unduly little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of an intervention by the White House at the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, who was admitted after Centcom's complaints.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press officer, stated in an opinion that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congress reports while the inspector general's investigations were still under way.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year's allegations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the intelligence information about the Islamic State reminds of the twigs of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had only provided a small crew force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker reported that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic state’s refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group’s financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his over-positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is ahead
One day after she had shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that won the Americans with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in mind.
But she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally up in their group with the Britons on the first place, which, after their 2-0 victory against Japan, remain unbeatable.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will each win the first and second place.
The first-placed will get out of the way the strong Dutch women who lead the other group a little longer.
Whatever the outcome of the Saturday game, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the last of the London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey bat in her hands for the first time at three years (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympic Games in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things around to the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work allowance in London that we now have.
We were able to pull the rudder all the way around.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backhand hit from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team appeared surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and ran the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shuttle was the first of the entire tournaments for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's running.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inextricably felt, a raging season run between competition and striving.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff that is passed by the crossbow to the swimmer to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation at the coffee shop in the queue without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a women's swirl with dimples, could well have been among these famous names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even champion.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not widely recognized: air gun shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have breast swimming and may rule it for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so narrowly perceived over the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and has had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain exterior charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonic trembling of its never-ending outburst - but also the Grazie des Turnen und Diving, the two sports that unites it essentially.
The word "Tramplin" comes from the Spanish el trampoline, which means as much as "spray board."
Arousing winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have a series of falling movements (driving, heaths and saltos) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopeers need to move on in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
Not only are they hunting the target line or the initial wall, but also another hone goal in television: the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel when I watch these games as a bit tiring.
The trampoline offers a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is up.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, seemingly unsightly like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the acquisition and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tournaments suggested recently according to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community to be ringing for air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that during the clash with the police, dozens of protesters were killed in shooting.
Is Ethiopia just breaking up?
Over the past ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and have spread to more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people rushed onto the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses reported policemen shooting and killing on tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos about the protests that are probably from last year or early in the course of this year show how security people beat young people with poles while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the government to suppress it - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven to the vast desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All the youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time the tensions along the border are rising to Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of boiling are now exploding under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate by means of social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in the case of protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they gathered in protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have been prospering in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's what's changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly disappointed in observing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr. Meles' position.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently abused by the government and then stolen.
During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.
And she's taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray's business and hate against the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge walk."
Donald Trump declared his claim Obama had been founded ISIS was "Sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, stating that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton had not been serious about the founders of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligiblely with the American public.
It also brings his associates, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After he had made the suggestion at a campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump walked back on Thursday’s claim and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation absolutely serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is slamming down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he strongly criticized himself when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained "Of course I meant that sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries of politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "explain" according to what the reaction is like." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who is observing the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of decoupling the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone, as his polls have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a major lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-and-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or of misinterpreting his humor.
But while he is more focused on attention in the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal rivals into the uncompromising situation to him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that Obama ISIS was an almost unknown little organization, he called them backbones, completely wrong and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, the government allowed ISIS to expand by allowing it to bring the situation in the Middle East under aggressive control.
Prior to the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and ordered them to ride around and be biased against each of his words.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't do it!".
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once over the price pushed away from the market, café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where only bar could be paid, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue storefront have been suppressed.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced verbs in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals considered it to be the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is exempt and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it's a new invention.
A reviving verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is also still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, contributed a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sauteed onions.
There are natural travel shots.
The café does not serve beer anymore, there are fresh juices for this.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly attended the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was on the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she again drinks coffee, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything badge with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't hold a grudge about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verbs with the cold-fried coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he intends to exhibit it soon, so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-fried coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand into a neighbouring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the premises and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a taster, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman tells from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side.
Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing house on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, unscrupulous snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.
"The rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese, and beans bread.
They have been prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that extends the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinste.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's teams cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the paths the country was taking to stop being the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense theme for the Americans," said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and cashrolls became basic food, the cashroll as a "wonderful way to recycle food remains," said Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetite ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for many years, has become a seldom served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out because a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical for many household recipes.
As never before or ever since, households - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - were driving the country's eating habits this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historic treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millionaire man of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was a great stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, housing a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most hopelessly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates at Eisenberg's had been cleared, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum feast, the President Roosevelt at noon.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got a reference three times.
Like a can-do bullie, he said to his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to Bild-Zeitung, saved life to almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives in order to pull people from bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him an 11-hour rescue from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horrors of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "This is the real jihad for me."
"When I die saving lives, I think God sees a martyr inside me."
Shortly before falling victim to Omar himself, Omar had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
Born in 1624, he swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get their offspring at 150 years old.
The Greenlandhai swims along the north Atlantic, and in an hour it averages about 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates on set 2.6 km/h - and is at this highest speed half as fast as a seal.
However, this life style, characterized by slowness, seems to be a recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock commented on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
For a long time, the evolution biologist thought that Greenland sharks were being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live in the ice cream above the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers don't know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measure their tempo of time when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks nevertheless make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal; another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol them on the ground of the ice cream and seek cadavers that pierce down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks who caught fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest was 502 centimetres.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the lens of the eye is formed even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will later not be renewed.
The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons tests carried larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests with a length of 220 centimeters, so it was likely that in its 2012 investigation it celebrated its 50th birthday.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which are caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenlandhai showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland sharks only get young when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of length were able to age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks are obviously able to multiply for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates today.
The fact that such methals live primarily in icy waters is not a coincidence.
Even the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, whose bacon was placed on the neck with a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often grow particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
In the recent session, the Municipal Council has focused its attention on matters relating to construction.
With ease, the board took up the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential buildings can finally begin".
After the land, parking and development questions could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - Extension section 1) is no longer in the way of interested persons.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and rusty seniors alike.
As it was called, constructionists can immediately report to the town hall, through the award of the parcels the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session.
In order also to be able to meet requests for the relocation of other commercial enterprises, in conjunction with job creation, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas only in spring of this year.
Thus, in the field of Unterzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is expanded by two parcels towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Thus, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies transferred from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether ATMs may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far passed the approval in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area, and other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
In Paris, although the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation (OECD) has its head office, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the scoreboard is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisor," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg was home to a large fund industry, it cut off less infrastructure, as did Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city also has easy-to-use commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtländer says.
At Seine, rents for first-class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than in Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer the city stands at seventh place, Luxembourg at 19th place, Dublin at 33rd place and Paris at 37th place.
Although quality of life is a matter of preference, "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IW concludes.
However, despite Brexit's vote, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
The strength ratios also speak for this: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimburse the legal costs incurred by her in the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a damages payment of $200 million for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were related to the Blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehaviour by Mercks, including mine and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to charge the costs incurred during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to resemble Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck claimed mutual complaints and property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-supported troops say that they have regained full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
The U.S.-backed troops have regained full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left it, said a group spokesman on Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are now coming through the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters that have been buried within the city.
They freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed Reuters of the man of the DK's military council.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are just doing clean-up work," he said Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return on Friday, which resulted in an income of USD 10.75 million for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons spent USD 1 million on charitable purposes, mainly on the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in Redehonorar; the former Foreign Minister reported an income of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, has published with his wife Anne Holton his tax returns over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a harsh contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false arguments and retreats in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have stated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," said Clinton's campaigner Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed.
Trump's critic, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, has already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding wealth, his donations for charities, his business events and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already taken a look at the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump asks to publish his tax return.
On Thursday she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisors on Friday who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is here to meet Trump to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he was also subject to IRS control and Trump had "fear" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that it only earned USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuds.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion along with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent four-stage method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears have been used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the toolkit, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they will be able to keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell's Managing Director in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bang and sprays fine dust to Chilipuder into the air.
A touch is usually already right out to chase the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower, who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects by commercial drivers take on a kiss hand - but the retail sector in the city centre is considered to be clearly capable of expanding.
The City Council, however, unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony.
"In general, we welcome new professionals, but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine bank this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director demolishes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election for "Arabic" appeal was removed - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre-elections, as it "needed" Arab guests according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah" left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's national election list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, for Israel to be eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "consistent decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and shocked by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has been done in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the administrator.
The incident triggered quite a lot of response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed to Kempinski Hotel that it would "give up" the alleged invitations of Arab guests.
It was said in another article that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations of itself and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction", Israel did not add to the quick-choice list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country's preselection has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spray on walls against the provisional president Michel Temer.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended president Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote for her resignation.
Russia & Iran trade suddenly rises to 71% - RT business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, the ambassador announced that the interest in business on the part of Russian companies has grown strongly in the country.
Russian companies enter into existing links with Iran, while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn was achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued around 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, are broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the Ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses looking for: Drinking market in Waldbröl
A robbery took place on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL on Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Subject to a gun, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces demanded the release of cash from the drink market employee and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver VW floor.
How much money was paid, the police don't tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the park deck of the Rewe market and poorly visible.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and fled from the gravel park opposite the park entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (at 19:45) related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Play and Fun at Summertime
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Nagold Children's Protection Federation with their caregivers at their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet home Hardtwäldle, the happy group was in the first week of school.
Several full day trips were on the program.
First of all, we went to Bretten with the visit to the Streichelzoos.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celt Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and planks.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautified, beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the gate of mercy
The ministrants from the soul care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg for four days.
Four steps were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Roma wall trip of all ministers in an expected two years, St. Anna's Chief Administrator Round decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Compassion, a special pilgrimage was offered with the gate of mercy opened for this purpose at Freiburger Münster.
16 Minis from Bitterbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Saints were on their way.
In the evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the cross of pilgrims and gave them to the pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a minster of Our Lady and the pilgrimage was started by the Münster.
The individual daily tours were surrounded in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writing texts.
But also on the way, the minis used to perform field crosses, chapels or churches often rested to sing a song from their own compiled pilgrim songbook.
For the nights each parish houses of the local parish were available.
At the stage goals Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, he went to Gütenbach about Furtwangen.
On the following days, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most difficult route, but had to first descend about 500 metres of heat and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathroom.
After the morning impuls on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely relieved and happy, the Minis met at Freiburger Münster on the later afternoon and passed through the door of mercy.
With a little impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis of cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the pilgrimage destination.
After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the Hochaltar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon, they returned by train to Horb.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong shared experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite Gold rings for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner ran for fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took over the anchor roll that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy's pound made the legend proud when he rushed home to take home a victory from New Zealand's favorite.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after, despite Hoys' resignation, they only got a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hindrance.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man where they stayed when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was close back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made up a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked forward to his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed to the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set up an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph at the site of Kennys and Hoys Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell onto the track.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
In such an overwhelming victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like it's all over the GB of Flags on the Tribune like London."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that awaits us successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same for Hoy.
Kenny will participate next in the Sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels kind of lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the destination in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the beaver, where Wiggins will be in the focus with certainty.
He had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday, when officials called to him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end in the morning, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie competed in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail bike team to dominate the mid-term of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been undermined.
Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying accusations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary call of GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the meltdown of Portland due to the termination of the energy contract in question
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and will terminate all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, it could have domino effects, as the meltage consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting pot in Portland is losing money and is risking a closure.
This step follows the year-long speculations about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity from the melting industry," the company announced.
AGL continued to argue that the contracts were so-called "security transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from the CJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual closing of $ 187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts that did not affect "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting process or to ensure the power supply to the melting process".
The US company said that it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it is still guilty of declaring why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland Smelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Janner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simple keeping up with the Kardashian likes?), written reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended with a classic turnaround: they all planned a surprise party.
This depicts the cliché-enforced action almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we forgot you??" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcast spot at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have beaten her as far as the Vogue cover was concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With an extent similar to a tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the Forest 615 pages advertising).
The revelation of his cover stars is expected so longingly that during the last two years pictures of the magazine have been sending through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, there have been clearly more "presences, models" than "models, which are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to them).
They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With its reality TV story Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague, Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the disheartening seems to pass by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your founding of Estee Lauder.
They and all their sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she can be seen in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Municipal rights centres annually reject 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by municipal law centres, while the sector focuses on the impact of further cutbacks on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delogation and the like - have been rejected on their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
The municipality's legal services, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources.
The Director of the Community Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Rights Centres revealed that thousands of people have been rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without repealing the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with untransparent and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Public Prosecutor-General and the Federal Justice Minister, as well as the Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately remove these short cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their customer communities as well as that the Government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump was charged with election campaign after employees allegedly pulled a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had turned a gun on a staff member in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a complaint filed in the national court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and hit the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the lawsuit.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gunmen and gun friends - should take measures if his rival Hillary Clinton was to be elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be agitated to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the breach of the duty of care and from Philip for injury to the body and permanent medical damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign worker.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey in front of national currencies: Losing SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses are recorded for the government parties SPD and CDU.
These were representative surveys conducted by the Insa Institute of Mental Research for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could be ruling almost further, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue to make the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was just in front of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (before 18.4%), the AfD would be represented for the first time in the country's day with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens hesitated by 6 percent (before 8.7 percent) back into the Swedish Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.
According to the Berlin Parliamentary elections, the SPD of the survey was only 23 percent (2011 elections: 28.3 percent).
CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They were still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Deputies for the first time by 14 percent.
At 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry as opposed to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market.
The successors now dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty smart.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The Nokia 9000 Communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover a few months earlier as "Büro im Westenbagnformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for the standards at the time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browsers, albeit painfully slow.
A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
Nobody knew in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything's been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns’ mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being always online, that's for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone a whole industry has since emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator to use everything easily via touch screen.
Apple’s victory move started, and the iPhone is still the most important product of the Group.
Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the legacy.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
Today, every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away the smartphone, too," said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it was back in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the Heathrow enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth and a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was elected the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented runs of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we extend this Olympic spirit and Heathrow to safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" related to ad blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to bypass ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocking on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post informing that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising ads to make it difficult to detect display blocking the recognition of which part of the advertising page is difficult.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-fight between the advertising-blocking Open Source community and the surrounding world has already been going on since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has joined in the struggle is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers worldwide; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices every day, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company has opted for ads blockers on Desktop PCs as mobile ads blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs represents a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook appears to invest in such a step as worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advantage tool" to give people more control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For the users this is not a positive experience, therefore we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker announced in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt means that instead we have focused on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
In case of suspected suicide, woman crossed the Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was passed over on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay herself on the road in the dark "in an act of despair" and was met by several cars, the police in Waadt said.
It is obvious that at the age of 49, a Swiss woman who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they as well as every witness of the incident asked to report.
An investigation procedure was opened which is a "logic" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers is shown.
Was a collision avoided?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - where one person was walking in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer of the negligent killing was released after she had attacked and killed a man who was one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has become unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfect extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly turned.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those on Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although once probably inhabited, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned off the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was released, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus that we know of today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned to the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations, leading too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer, I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give it more depth, it needed it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the Avalanches 2013-14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league during his debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Nordic oil workers take up talks again, put out strike
The labour struggles for the compensation of North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the parties to the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were performed sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current dispute," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks that will start next year to address the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, the first one in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates to its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The Company's rate reduction follows a 10-percent drop for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure as a result of the lower rowing trip, an economic situation which was strengthened by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of about $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates and in what context the rotation periods with the rise of the planet are.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotational rates, these rippling stars emit large amounts of starwinds.
As these winds travel through the stars' magnetic fields, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a visible star spot -- like sunspots --.
The latest catalogue of rotational rates points out that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the ballet of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
As the cluster of stars is so close to the Pleiades, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.
"The Pleiades' cluster of stars offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still much ahead of us about which we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the Pleiades rotational rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star leaves
The tears ran at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the league three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players display similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the baseball hall.
Because as successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to ESPN, to have taken away prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was blocked for 211 games due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to have been the main suspect to have received for years through an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida.
After a legal dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014, because I've been through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said süffisantly.
His farewell days also do not run out of silence.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't have a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," ate Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, the fans of the Yankee War Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Reached: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would almost have won a medal.
Prior to the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases became known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-mountain runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested positively in Brazil and have been excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions, these messages come at the present time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the finals of 100 metres of butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the events over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-proofing and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands of Chen full cooperation in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court CAS and will accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive sample at Danekova was heard, and the 33-year-old went to the offensive.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-proof has already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately expressed criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't make the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation may not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the "Adrian Zielinski" case was also known, the London Olympian in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both challenge the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
The Danekova case is a particularly serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport before the start of the athletes.
The IAAF World Association had banned the launch of the entire Russian team, except for systematic doping, and Kenya's runner-up also produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the former crimes in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinks purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 metres of freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a discussion with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping badgers," he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the Trimetazidin in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but only a three-month lockdown had to be held.
Data store: So perfide blackmail hackers their ransom
Developers of blackmail malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed became at least once in the past twelve months, sometimes several victims of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 per cent of the companies were already the target of a Ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators specialize in their blackmailer software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be extorted is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching an alarmingly fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks has been horrifyingly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the victim's computer, it looks for recently modified files such as word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production ceases.
Accordingly, the damage will be higher if a ransomware is damaged.
22 percent of German companies affected reported loss of sales through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case people were at risk of death.
In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients may be at acute risk due to the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of the cessation of operations.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by bitcoin, set up or decrypt free-accessed support sites for example files.
And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the Ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about within a week."
It is more likely, however, that these are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Contained in delivery is a customization tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then ordered spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT managers in the malwarebytes survey are confident to be able to defend Ransomware using file backup and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful rape, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is much higher than before depending on the type of data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
Safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control at the hacker conference Defcon.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole production street in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the little HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overcharged, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work closely in any place.
The materials of the interior are well processed and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top falls off something.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage.
Not only is there a suitcase room of 453 l at raised and 1026 l at folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat of the back bench can be folded up like Kinosel and thus provide storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height at 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little more quietly.
The average daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not reveal any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
Safety systems include the City-Not Brake Assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track maintenance assistant.
The collision warner sometimes annoys, because he assesses many obstacles as "related objects" when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to the traffic sign identification and, if necessary, threshs the speed.
But there is full connectivity only for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit understandable to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
If you don't want to invest so much, the petrol company will receive from EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability can only be considered in the event of dangers typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any compensation.
Illness: When paid by the organizer
After their trip, sick holidaymakers will only get back money if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family on the second day of their Turkish leave was severely affected by diarrhea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the journey had been flawed - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
Although the sewage treatment plant was actually defective.
However, the organizer only learned of it shortly before departure from the plaintiff.
He had to assume until then that the seawater was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, the verdict.
In particular, no impurities were found in the samples of water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among one another - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to decide and resolutely react to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not treat the terrorists with this triumph.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced another staff reinforcement of the security forces, i.e. "in the middle of four-digit order over several years".
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance should be improved, the law of arms should be revised in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently discussed obligation of silence for doctors should be preserved according to de Maizière's words.
However, in a dialogue with the medical community, he wants to find solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said, with a view to mental apprehensions.
In order to prevent the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social support is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of hidden investigators.
SPD Head Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke out clearly against actionism.
"This was a slap for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full wear is considered to be a constitutional problem.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chefin Simone Peter threw before the minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with all new anti-terror packages.
Left-party director Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet speech and a tightening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the highway transporter
It is regularly on the bypass - here a picture of November.
But this should change: the right track should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are stuck in traffic on the surrounding road every night when they drive across the highway (A 43).
The country's road construction operations extend the right track by 700 meters on Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Street.
The big advantage: the traffic splits up early, thus improving the overall run-off on the much-traveled section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district represented Münster-West.
The road junction on the feeder irritates the drivers mainly between 17 and 7 pm.
On working day, the return to the bridge extends over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only steered in one lane via the motorway bridge.
The second trail had to be rebuilt well in the final quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to take up the heavy duty traffic twice in particular.
How long this narrow pass and the associated working day stowage will last, the responsible country business cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official rest period until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right track, the country's business has deliberately chosen the less-traffic time in the school holidays because it is likely to be disabled.
The traffic will be passed by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural trip: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the staging of the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most young people in the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among other things, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless, according to the press release of Jungen Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languagel, and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural journey" continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star snaps: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a strike through the bill to the Sternschnup-Guckern in Southwest Germany on the night of Friday - but there is hope.
The night was poorly suited for clouds and rains to watch the sky's spectacle, said Hans-Ulrich Keller, chairman of the Welzheim Observatory on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather's supposed to be good, then we'll probably see a lot of stars in the sky.
The observatorys are Persians, with 216,000 kilometers per hour, among the fastest observatorys.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already far before the alarm bell to no longer think of sleep.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, with such problems one is in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent experience sleep frequently or permanently than are not restful.
What are some problems with sleep or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands from a rural point of view, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and sleep-through disorder.
Many people feel as dissatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the Deutsche Hauserzteverband mit praxis im Niedersächsische Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this, organic, psychological or behavioral factors can also be found, but also drugs.
Not rare, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early wake-up is particularly common in depression," Weeß says.
And it may be that different factors are interrelated.
For example, if you have a disc incident, you can lie down, wake up every two to three hours, and you may start grumbling about everyday problems and worries, give Weeß an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you have trouble sleeping to a doctor?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, advises you weed.
The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten down, tired, unsleeped, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
To alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks - for example.
Lowered sleepers are hardly available in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have problems with your sleep, you should first contact your home doctor, advise Weeß.
He may investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For example, for the study in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise on snoring with atemaussetzers, in ill-fated daily fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You really don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After wiring one goes to bed at its normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglass, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws where you can put on for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and uptimes, not too long lying in bed, on the day do not sleep, do not look away to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cut off of the DSV team at Olympias.
In December 2014, he had first won gold at the World Short Railway Championships in Doha, and at the same time set his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself via Facebook to protect himself from his ex-team colleagues who are critically critical.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets a prize of 20,000€ and a jungle king of 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night on Friday.
The transport system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and doping does not look so closely or even operate it.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported as early as nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is the way to keep it with countries.
"If you cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for some time before WM/OS, you may not be allowed to take part," demands the Electoral Hamburger, who is now operating an ice-cream.
Airport: Gangs of Luggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
The suspects had committed several pocket and luggage thefts as gangs.
At approximately 21.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from previous theft.
Since mid-July this year, the two women and two men had committed several crimes and had committed joint, active and particularly professional cases.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had come to Germany to commit crimes.
In doing so, they had a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between there is a rest of the stone pavement: Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this at first glance, but the police are one of the city's "fertile places".
Walking along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.
To the facade of a gray house someone sprayed "heavy!"
In contrast to a Lidl, which is about to be torn off, it is already being built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built until 2017.
However, in the last few weeks, articles on this "stendful part of the city", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferred to be illustrated with burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator Henkel had repeatedly spoken out for a tough action by the police against the project, the area as "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.
On June 22nd, after the ground floor rooms, which had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patrolled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of unknown house owners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the road looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are mainly fond of the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted police protection from wandering left.
The tomb, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between housekeepers and their neighbours, does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional workers' district, which has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and the housing projects from which they were born have long been part of the Kiez.In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under a large police commission in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still partially inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents of GDR times and former housekeepers now share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the case of rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by inlaid disks or freshly painted facades that have been advertised with paintbags.
No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are damage to property, which tend to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, it is deplorable: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, who were certainly not.
Also the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than anywhere else."
Neugebauer has consciously moved to Riga - and remained.
That's why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: by sightless new buildings in former buildings that crowd out the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately real estate apartments that are not interesting to many here - people who are not so well-behaved are more likely to live here," she says.
"I cannot approve of violence and destruction at all."
But what should you do if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry with color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who moves out should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub neighborhood can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.
The social educator supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact point for all actors: refugees, working group Refugee Assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine's client from the working group suggests that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the owner-legging wool milksau, which has a problem in particular.
For example, some - less mocking than rather aiming at the variety of desired tasks - had meant that the administration wanted to write out the job.
An administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in social work, just an own-legged wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it was about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50-percent stand limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine customer, Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers are soon standing in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find accommodation for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of building, renting or refurbishing these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibilities change from the County Council to local government and job centres.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
In fact, the administration does not find private dwellings.
So far, it does not work, it is dependent on private homes, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, community homes need to be abducted, as it is called so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are traineeships, training centres, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive outside effect.
That's "no employment therapy."
But work doesn't just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So this is also where administration and honorary officials jump in.
It is essential that refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it is taking time and that they can make good use of time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develop the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach should not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people who don't do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
That's all a "mommut job."
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalisation after recent events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive". A residual risk could and would not exclude them.
But the helpers would be sensitive.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They're afraid that the assassins will bring them to complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So local and regional officials must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Do Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics shys away.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the spot.
"We have not yet arrived in Urbach, where we can go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already burdened with integrating the previous people wisely.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Invaders wanted with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
On Friday morning, at 8.50 p.m., two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg.
The inhabitants surprised the two, and struck the evils into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black capuzenpullis.
They fled to downtown.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter to catch them.
The discovery went on without success.
Perhaps the unknown fell before the fact of the apartment or in their escape.
