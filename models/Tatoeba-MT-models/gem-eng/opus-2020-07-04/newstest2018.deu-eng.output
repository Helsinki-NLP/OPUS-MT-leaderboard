Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insane institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A mine chapel where is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's annoying when maps aren't up-to-date.
Anyone who had to get excited at times knows this because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer from the State Government's Geoportal Bayern, are anything but current - but very informative.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the district of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed maps, so-called initial position sheets, were included for cities and communities.
These were created according to the Bavarian survey administration between 1810 and 1864 and are the result of the first measurement of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical image of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, they were the neighbors today who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern card.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Gesamtungsverwaltung.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek website like everyone else.
The comparison between the former and the present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as Munich district.
Today, Unterendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: When zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "view", from which the base tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer show farmers - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sun" facility.
A large green area stands north of Unterendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In today's district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or "Auf der Luften" from the hill - but also in large letters "Ire Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with delusions.
There, 1858/59, the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of so-called delusions.
He has also forbidden staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked with the institution for an exhibition.
For 280 patients, space had been initially, and later 500 places were expanded.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district centre in Haar 1905.
There is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatry since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
Western is the football ground of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural advocacy of the origins of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in the case of bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was named "Kaufinger Gasse" in 1856.
A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies hit many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the spatula for the second S-Bahn trunk.
With the slider, the old Munich card can be compared to today's aerial picture - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorers has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to come into force until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourins to pay special attention to travel through the state and to have extreme caution given that a number of questionable racial incidents have recently occurred in the whole state and are noted here," the Group's opinion states.
A recently adopted Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that aim disproportionately for minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri State Attorney's Office showing that black drivers in the state are being stopped 75 percent more often than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring bail money or let relatives know they're travelling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate-crime report program, which would rank the state as to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for residential or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws to oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he operates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also chairman of Fischerbach BLHV, he referred to the Weidezaun project as "elementary".
I cannot profitably manage in such steep areas.
The green land area provides a lot of work, many things have to be processed with the motor sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he had taken over the parent holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not carry out any organic farming.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognised the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader funding".
With costs ranging from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the areas to be reforestationed for a very long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often critical because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in via the pasture fence promotion.
The open area shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be deforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded through Leader, one quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, the farmers remained at EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers you can't do it".
Also for Peter Weiß: "The best food is produced here".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The existence of an LPR support framework is a prerequisite.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be segregated (upper 35 percent slope) and must therefore be at risk of reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The surface area is 35 hectares, the calculated cost is more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing holy anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have limped him if he had.
But he seized their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, was added 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base.
As Miller Acosta scolded: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is actually right, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It's about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus' exasperating words, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the wretched waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "elone waste" could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who tried to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the overnight world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to light the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh hit something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to light the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Championship: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
The UK's Athletics Director, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Championship Framework will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.
Black believes that "something special has to be developed in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallion candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Elidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilith naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join the 400m world championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes in the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Muir medium-distance runner leads this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, running 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season of victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only members of the team, but in some cases will also participate in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"I am obviously very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It only shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb podia.
As far as my speech as captain concerns?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home-world championship.
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics about Facebook: Do not advertise a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He smacked the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led to slaughter like sheep."
It takes me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the Governor - who is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Ms., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment field of the news broadcast "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they'll be denied by some rather than a so-called collective approach and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "presidency".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical editorials and to burn or arrest demonstrators and to silence them.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook site.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable shipping had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers joined his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Appeals criticising his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain exceeded his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinion and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true guidance means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for local comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led next to the Archerfield left until the final round before losing against Paul Eales, is connected with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a zealous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"That feels really special," said the native Southport player.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program in the year after I had won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the promotion at home.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went so far."
With the trio in the field, the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one occupant and £ 10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are caused by passive smoking per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections appear to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much is hidden, which is not reflected in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, represents a major problem for the Bautrupp company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of car drivers in front of red traffic lights and lockouts is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road was blocked and only the regular buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite strenuous.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a cook.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the roasted tube is removed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with dull water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she has not been assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most village men are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to run around in the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was introduced in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by means of a public hand survey before the occupation troops.
An existing movement that stirred up independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Papua West, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desert. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs converted by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan revered a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Degei, pointing to her lively hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a state-of-the-art province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
Freeport alone reduced the value of USD 3.1 billion in gold and copper in 2015.
In addition, Papua has wood resources valued at an estimated USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuan army, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gooses and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papuan tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We'll lose everything" says a report by the archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric beatings are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic trends change as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jayapura.
"It has cost the native Papua - the Mama-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
During his election campaign 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in Volksmund, promised to address the inequalities and violations in Papua.
The former roommate secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point in October only two months after Yokow’s inauguration.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The scared kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers began her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - in the circle running and imitating a bird singing - by Papua Mee Pago-stamm.
Some demonstrators began to sling stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and called the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, lots of shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Yuw was hit three times, so his cousin, who was witness the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings only came to Jakarta the following day 'filtered'.
Three weeks, in Jayapura, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the victims' families and sworn to address the historic maladies in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an out-of-court mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that need to be dealt with," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke with TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything will be regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been committed, including the Paniai incident.
Family members of the Paniai Sacrifices accepted such allegations with cruel infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military is afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Agitated villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness, as the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest cook for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal partners, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Papuan Republic by instigating sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years, under the pretext of "assuring national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as far out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially notation and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, each able to process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic disparities between the local Papuan and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nabire.
The few jobs available in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills needed to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions on reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to remove the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations and said to journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan authorities say that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their voice for Yokowi as a "death" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents from which 337 meters high, 79-storey buildings fled.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is incidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shouting people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of firefighting around 4.00 am Local time (00.00 GMT) wiped out the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the persons concerned.
The incident can relive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rises around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the paneling, the outer panel for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disguise at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best of Five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) went through with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the session in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning points was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long but also highly appreciated five-satellite classics thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change in order to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
They will continue to work to improve their applications.
Not only did the vote take place after many objections had come before the proposal to pass the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings prohibited items into the aircraft, finds out a survey
A survey of flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously banned objects were smuggled past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration control points, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had gone wrong with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to obey the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately locked by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the preferred contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who fly the most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complex and confusing.
People are often unsure about which liquids they may take or how much of it.
It is no surprise, therefore, that the largest quantity of liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk's electro-thousand massage with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has failed to confirm that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales goals, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
In the past few months, Musk had frequently purchased more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euros (US 1000 US dollars and UK 1000 Pounds) "Reservation payment" completely back.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.
His argument: the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but in production.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it is supposed to be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads that have never been tested in practice without any major disruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
If, however, there are major delays, then the non-bindingness of reservations could become the problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPO Head Pruitt withdraws because of delaying the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-induced air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved itself to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action which had been brought against his previous body in a federal appeal court.
It is a deadline that came on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who had been President Donald Trump’s attorney for Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved on to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agency.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator exceeded its authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turn to Ozone Standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and has then been waiting to be charged with activist groups and others, and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who charged the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority we have."
However, the EPO's opinion stated that Pruitt will someday use its "extensive authority and all other legal powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress urged a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the Smog flowing into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year.
Representatives of the public health sector and the environmentalists rejoiced over Pruitt's surprising exchange of courses.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe in," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer to polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday, July 16.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the area have made Tumlingen's friends and sponsors their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique leash."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg documentary book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the document, in addition to the former parish church on the Tumling mountain, there was also a glorious court to which the Church or the Patronate Court belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" was the third, the masterful settlement center of the village.
Old cards from time to time around 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
Patronat's right was derived from the early medieval right of self-church.
A gentleman who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor continued to be the owner of this church and was able to inherit it.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell then rang 1692 for the first time, but had to be released later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed in and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796 French troops were located near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Leftovers of the church threatened to fall in 1809.
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilarius was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's night of 1834 a storm burst into the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cut off.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentnern" as the successor to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday 16 July, as organizer, friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is designed by the combo of Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is starting at 3.30 p.m.
To the sound of the Serenade, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest", the organizers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörsschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade-Organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have windwheel approval checked
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval at the Boisheimer Nette on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all, since at the time in fours only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These zones are intended to prevent the "sparification" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier because of a change in the land use plan, which had not been approved by the District Government of Düsseldorf because of a formal error.
"Because of the lack of a planning requirement, the approval decision is still illegal and therefore also illegal," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim is defending himself".
Current state of affairs: The City Council has decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This does not permit the establishment of wind turbines to be subject to planning legislation at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received at County Viersen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them for the occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not wish to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four 200 metre high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, where the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had already concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households are to be met - that is, about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen as well as to a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday mornings around 10:00 on L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two more people were easily injured.
The Landesstraße remained closed for hours.
According to police records, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich accompanied her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion, L 333 headed for Bogel.
City and retailers plan "home shopping" weekends
Bath Langensalzaers and people from the region will re-discover shopping in the city centre in September.
The commercial association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the shopping mall into the city center.
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat Shoppen" weekend is intended to raise customers' awareness of the offers offered by their own city, apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the downtown shops are supposed to invite you to the "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action is aimed not only at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, commercials were on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend of action, says Christian König.
Urban and Commercial Associations cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
With this, the commercial association and the city enter another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Activ-Day" for the Brunnenfest and the open Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and no parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalising the city centre - up to renting, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was a good thing to overcome the lethargy with a network that was partly wide-ranging, the king said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were participating for the first time on the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "encourage the appreciation of local trade and demonstrate its importance for the common good of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also made clear that each citizen can influence his own direct environment with his buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis two people have been killed and nine others have been injured, some of them hard.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) there was another injured person in critical condition.
A person died when part of a school building crashed during the explosion.
A first missing person was also saved dead later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of unhappiness, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
Few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building during the holiday season.
Trump put pressure on the payoff of the border walls after chained transcripts of telephone calls to Mexico
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump, in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, asked him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly beaten the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidency campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the US and sworn to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would make refugees who emigrated to Australia "laugh", "mies" and "dumb" take over and that the existence of the trade that was conveyed by the Obama government would make him look like a "deep" after proposing a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford-Massaker: Activists bring up racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and climbed onto the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" the man roared.
"Keep him out of the car!"
Shout the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, played on July 22nd, is only a rendition.
But when a loop is thrown around the neck by "roger", almost all in the audience are very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murder.
"It is really impossible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of readjustment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a life-long citizen-law.
For him the rendition serves as a dramatic call to act and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
A court doctor lays a bedcloth on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lychen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, citizens' rights tell us that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, named for a woman, was holding a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight.
Brooks said that the rumour in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was wearing wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to liberate Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they got away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, erased evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it in a more concise way.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual re-establishment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Her portrayal is vivid, touching and is based in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and look away even more difficult, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because we are then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director.
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said that the role never gets easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, who screams at Hester and harasss him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alerted and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--he' then."
"But", one of the other black actors whispered.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy doing this properly, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it harshly and emphatically.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the actors' bodies and exudes Billie Holidays' sorrowful praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks in every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced Georgia's pressing humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spicy.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children cling to their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his co-players and then breaks up crying in her arms, the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At a table a white couple from Atlanta chattered about the postage with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feel of the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "it's only now called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table, eating and remembering the civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The replication is in some way inspiring, for it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is so if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is sentenced to repeat it."
The Wagnerians reconciled in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivol staging in front of a gigantic six-storey setting.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a swirling street corner, along with Wallerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "plaster and elastic" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls or, alternatively, an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power, and greed - which draws through its "ring" production.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - are wonderfully harmonizing as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tear a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and give the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously ugly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later Gunther (Markus Oake) also has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause.
It is stormy to celebrate Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows hands to Merkel-raute.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in layered leisure clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directorate team had been expected with excitement.
If he had to have a valid pepper concert in 2013, five years later there was a big shout in which the single "buh" shouts went down.
Katharina Wagner must have been happy about it.
"One can see that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the dpa performed.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf but also grew an understanding of its view.
I'll take a positive summary.
Max Mencht works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where's everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at the school all day.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I am dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late-call volunteer.
How's that coming?
Lots: I made Abitur.
And then, let's say, a civil engineering study has been successful.
I realized it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight that you can see how it really is on the spot, perhaps at the focal point.
And was it like that?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I'm going to do dual studies, probably do a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and study at Hamm University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a little unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irrigated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works out.
Different from the Bautekinstudie?
Quantity: Well, this isn't about calculating statics.
You always have other people's heads, each of which has a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family, you always have to look into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any anxiety?
Lots: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's the way life is.
Pearson shortens another 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to revive the business
On Friday, the British education group Pearson said that they would reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The job losses announced by Director General John Fallon mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost reduction program a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after it had grown from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack from Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed one NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, and a declaration was made by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
Bombarding is the last violence that has taken place in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "impproved explosive rate carried by persons".
The statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they were carrying out this attack.
On May 31st, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the country's most lethal military attack, since the U.S. forces in 2001, the Taliban has been displaced by power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs on increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police forces in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in government, politics and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghana in recent weeks.
EPO reverses decision to delay the smog rule after appeals
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, which states are obliged to curb Smog-induced emissions, a day after 15 States sued the agency for the action.
The EPO announced late Wednesday that it would push forward the so-called "Ozone provisions 2015", and said that it would show the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue and that we respond to our state partners," said EPO CEO Scott Pruitt in an explanation.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the measurement of ozone requirements in part of the country's emissions to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to stimulate economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO's website says that breathing in air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants a Community space
In the end, the decision was clear: in two votes against, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a community space in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area of municipal ownership to be owned by the church community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be approved by a private investor.
For this, there is a discussion on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal councils propose that such a community space should not be regarded as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senior residence, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the "trickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is offset by funding options.
The building is located in the renovation area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a Community area would be eligible, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal for a decision is designed to signal the investor that he does not want to throw any knots between his legs in this respect, to state that both saddles - which are inspired by the environment - and pult roof - which reduces the height and makes construction more economical.
Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer doesn't just mean that he's added it.
If it helps, he'll go through the board unanimously.
It's not that simple in the community room.
Daniela Ruf points to the many own buildings, with which one does not get so straight ahead, for this one now leans from the community room out of the window, she says, "I'm doing hard with them".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely opposed to the participation of local authorities in the Community area.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to either wealth or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the land does not give a subsidy, but it is the opposite.
Mr Staiger's request to split the draft decision accordingly has three supporters.
Thus, with two votes against in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up in this way: "If we make the decision in this way, we will make a huge step towards closing a gap in our infrastructure".
Kollision by car: The cyclist is thrown on the road
On the road crossing, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught in Garath on Wednesday by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had come on the road to Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the road up the road At Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the reverse traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a van.
FC Bayern Munich must surrender to David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game go against Dortmund.
The FC Bayern travels with staff to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven pros are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
The personnel services at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 o'clock/ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to give up David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has been responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good the last time."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The duel of the two German football heavyweights puts the fans in jeopardy.
The game is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk from star to star in the resin
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created throughout the country.
This is the plan of the club St. Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "starpath" meets the need for information from many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sporting performance.
The members want to set up along the planned route tables and inform about stars and constellations accordingly.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations in five to six places" in the Oberharz.
Question came St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later the star path train is to be extended by train.
"On the Starpath, the viewers learn much about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it lies farther away.
Also, in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to be seen.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the Bergstädtchen St. Andreasberg, the highest-ranking observatory in northern Germany.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the site is one of the six darkest regions in Germany in the middle of the National Park Harz.
Often you can see clearly from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the naked eye.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the funding association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned star dwarf - the planet path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path leads up to Hainberg and the observatory, as well as an "exterior" location in Diemarden (community equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stelaes with the individual planets - including the dwarf planet degraded Pluto at the end point - are precisely positioned at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the sun exactly 75 metres away still measures 70 centimetres.
The entire distance of the planet's path is approximately four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the Stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion who went down the hallway to welcome Lomagenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Hederweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomagenko-Manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I climbed up for broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I'd like to get down on weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans are demanding.
Let's give them that."
Lomanakenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomagenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him," Garcia said, and later expressed themselves openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomagnoko as "a huge fighter", and he might be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomagnoko stopped by the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the three-fighting champion from Riverside is looking very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy working on it," Garcia said.
Lomagnoko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tire racks
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle about 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point.
The car slid to the right into the evil, where he crossed and then remained on the roof in the green stripe.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured during the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane at the accident site could be passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
After the 2:2, Andre Hoffmann hopes for the start of the season against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defense formation will bring points to Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season, with the result too, would not have been the two countergates at the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"There were two countergates too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge, the tricycle chain is also to be further optimized.
And a gate after a free kick doesn't want to catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, it will be the case that no one is going to line up next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will manage better even after the experience in preparing the tricycle chain than with the four chain.
"Now I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players who can build well in the triangular chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"Requirement is required, but that we are even more harmonious and that we do not make so many playback mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak of a failed start after a certain one, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be terminated prematurely because of an unwetter.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, believing that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they have no heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they're currently standing," says Fortuna's internal defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we sweep them away just because we have the right to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance with only one defeat against aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to hit from the beginning," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and obscene."
And that's how Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Test published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the persons tested are over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Authority (Rättsmedikelverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Agency) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be "under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have remained stable over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite constant," he said The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was considered to be more than 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the applicant lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "proposal that the person examined is 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
The assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgeting a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18, this is about 10 percent."
Full in plan
The works on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well advanced.
On Wednesday a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the government bureau Freiburg.
In April, work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arch bridge that is covered in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, she has come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at Lauterbach's entrance has now received on Wednesday morning a 1.50 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a margin fixation, which is also used as a operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge a bridge cap of 2.20 meters is to be used on Friday.
Then the footpath is supposed to go on.
The special thing about this is that these are final parts, a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.
There is also a fiber optic cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed about the project by handcuffs in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher towards Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortangang, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully blocked.
The cost of the three bridge refurbishments is EUR 700 000.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only hard to put under one hat.
The parties represented in the Vulkaneifel District Day (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance, which on this day shows peaceful flag, because the AfD invites the city hall Rondell to the "big election start" poster.
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event on site do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondel - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the town hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forums A world and one of the major organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, especially at the station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he had worked for such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun but got a cancellation there because due to the already built Laurentius kirmes there are not enough parking spaces available.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on the Rondell front, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
That's what it does: At about 8 p.m. on the Rondell front there is a band for entertainment, in the town hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfälzian AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy president Beatrix von Storch to deliver her speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
Some more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests in the courtyard have a longer breath, but also there is shortly after 21 o'clock it is recommended to clean up.
The police can drop off - no special incidents.
Trombone Meets Trumpet
A listener with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli can be heard in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he performs a concert under the motto "Schwarzmeer meets Schwarzwald", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in Blasmus.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European leading orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds with the two as in a new suit, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the program was first premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite into grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?"
The probably best-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the "twilight" collegiate Robert Pattinson, who finally got bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So I've never been confused or hindered.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered from "Bang Showbiz" but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And perhaps some may call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the general public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
On Thursday evening, the Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in jubilation.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia at 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening saying: "The change of the Party of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least-legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unanimous message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of athletics Sebastian Coe praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to get back into sport.
Russia's Athletics Head Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that the banishment of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away in gold and silver medal competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found indications of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it had experienced some rather hot times and that it would do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" about Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which start on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still insufficient and banned trainers are still working freely, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Tragedy for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security conditions.
The Secretary of Defense Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing to the unsolved crash case.
She described the two killed pilots as "Knowledge of her craft".
"We pride ourselves on this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old staff chief from Northern Hesse were killed in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a German army's death watch.
At noon only the members of the church took their leave.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourning guests laid down roses, the relatives stood armed in arm with the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen called the killed soldiers "decorated" and put in action.
The Chief of Staff had built up Tiger's operations in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this crew could not turn down the crash, no one would have been able to do so".
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von der Leyen: The deployment was dangerous.
But he was also of great importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Armed Forces did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal house announced this on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, it was further stated in the announcement.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a heel out that he was not happy with his title.
After the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also made the title "prinzgemalhl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesperson of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be unclear.
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's been working for in the last 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
At the Thames he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later wife’s visit to the people’s sympathies, Prince Henrik had a severe position in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia Tabak and who in this country had the call to be the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for care.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
After the loss of the red-green government majority to a rapid re-election of the Landtag, Minister Stephan Weil (SPD), he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday we voted for Parliament's resolution.
Previously, the surprising resignation of a Green MEP from their Landtag faction in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the Landtag elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
Mr Björn Thumler, Head of the CDU Group, wants to recommend that his group accept them.
With this, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landtag, SPD and Grüne 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether to continue ruling in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil believes, however, that it is essential that the Landtag decides its own resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be tested legally clean," Thumler said.
"All questions will be discussed quietly if they have been properly examined in law."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good".
She referred to herself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the abstinent MEPs to return their mandate.
"We assume, of course, that they return their land-day mandate, which she has received through the green country list, with immediate effect," said Meta Janssen-Kuzz and Stefan Körner.
The Group president of the Greens, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of every two-way party."
They decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no content differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the betrayal of the Low-Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten as a betrayal of the CDU.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of the Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the Landtag to be re-elected quickly.
Twesten's exit costs the majority in Niedersachsen.
The politician "put her personal interests in front of the good of the country in her injured vanity and in her frustration," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Niedersachsen's CDU faction leader, Björn Thumler, is recommending his deputy to take each Twesten to the CDU.
The group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, proposed to Twesten that the results of the 2013 Landtag elections be distorted with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the country day.
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speaking and answering.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de, the Länder will update the latest information on the affected eggs.
Eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at the moment, a health risk is virtually excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the range - because the central role of the informer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the news of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade, as well as manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe to health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg, they shall not be capable of transport.
However, unladen eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the farms are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production plants are not directly responsible.
On the contrary, because of the alleged illegal practices of service providers, they have to expect economic damage.
As always, there are too few controllers in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of human resources or a lack of coherent competence?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent.
That is precisely why a consistent clarification of such events and the handing over to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly indignant.
This means that manufacturers, distributors and consumers have entered a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the unlawful use of fipronil in the holding of food-provided animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation promptly and without delay.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain in Spain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organisation that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules created by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money easier for Neymar to sign and take him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but they have to counter with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even points in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations that had taken huge debts upon themselves in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on the debt of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP commitment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And even though Platini has fallen from the presidency in unhappiness in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to oppose excessive spending.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that for the next five years, the sum of revenue can be declared in the annual financial statements amounting to 44,4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, the PSG met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by keeping up their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsoring was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the organization committee of the World Cup 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar would become World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandise and jersey sales.
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new forest supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is redesigning the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwest Schweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolate Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small red-white packed slags distribute 14 grams per year to the passengers before landing.
Swiss didn't want to make any information about the costs.
Insider industry estimates the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: It is a prestigious job for a forest manufacturer.
How many candidates there are at the new tender will not betray the Swiss.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come into question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Since 2006, the Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class are spoiled with deliciousries by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class wet passengers Shoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short distance, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolate Frey, both in business and in Economy Class.
Athletics - Diskus Olympian Robert Harting Achieves World Cup Final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympian of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup withdrawal and could only look at the discus competition from the tribune.
The Polish defender Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 metres long, also qualified for the final battle with the first attempt.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (when the forethoughts David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
Stifled at the core of the Gag - medium-aged actors playing horny children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to get the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the caste principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Shakes the Cradle").
At one point a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The dear Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy and evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's "Singles" sublime bar, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It's the moments of random madness that this franchise could cheer up like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how she will visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Ringkampf iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-stood Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gigs to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it drags away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited on a smaller length, could deliver his agitprop satellites better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything as a feeder for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger story and with itss.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police were able to fight the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Procuratorate of Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and have already issued arrest warrants against them.
The officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspect Italians.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The project involved Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were involved.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Prosecution Office of Konstanz has been investigating organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange, and Kripo Rottweil's investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
On Wednesday morning, therefore, four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale operation.
The investigation mainly included Italian nationals with a close link to Italian mafia.
Also, an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, during which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the gang's account.
Way regrets big gaps in the foreigners register
"Data from citizens who shouldn't show up there": According to a report, the Ausländer-Register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads partly to serious misdecisions in asylum proceedings.
According to Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Federal Government's refugee management officer has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of foreigners in a media report.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "many serious misdecisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, warned in an analysis presented by the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, 10 million people are registered with foreign nationals, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data will therefore be managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register anymore".
"Faulty data inputs can significantly slow return processes," the report goes on to say.
The statistics on people subject to leave are covered by EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
However, such false allocations led "to a distorted debate on the handling of travellers", it is said in the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy once they have arrived from there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has carried out such procedures "with regard to families with children, with the exception of infants and toddlers, to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU state are the first to reach them.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, this State can return it to the country of entry.
The office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased considerably".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The interlocutor of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Familys with children are threatening humane reception conditions because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system and the risk of child welfare".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach already provided blood donation to other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who received the award on Friday.
First of all Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, in the meeting of the Council of Municipalities, the congregation is worthy of multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is designed for this and we still pay respect to donors who make their blood available to strangers unprofitable," added Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the canned are broken into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK Kreisbereitschaftsleiter.
Obviously, the change to the theater house a few years ago led to higher attendances.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were honored for 50 donations each.
Half as many books are made by Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Prümmer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave ten times per 500 milliliters of their life's juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" as it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The Bank's monetary committee (MPC) policymakers voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month seeking an increase as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that in the coming years, interest increases would be necessary in order to reduce the inflation fuelled by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to make cheaper financial resources available to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Shortly after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real income of households continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she repeated that "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" would be needed to cool down inflation and a "a little greater" than the markets expect.
Markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "staged" and "limited".
The Bank's downward forecast of growth for this year and next year compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
Pounds fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The recent report on inflation showed little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slightly higher salaries, since the tightening first becomes worse before it will improve.
It added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot "prevent income loss", but it added that wages will recover "clearly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full price and economy.
Prior to the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "totally" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for business in a noisy way and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV-prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against financing the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which could reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now provided by the health service for an estimated 10,000 people through a first three-year study.
He declared himself willing to finance the trial after the appeal court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as "significant new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "distinct moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the presence of infectious agents.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In hospitals, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is widely used, absorbed and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress that has continued for more than three decades in tackling one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it helps us to get closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society.
Living a big life: intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earl's Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her pockets.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above one another, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand.
He had to think creatively in order to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above one another - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so if you push up the door, it's very easy to slide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than 500 million dollars.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief executive and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
One court record states that this means that Colin has property worth 316 million dollars and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed conciliations.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but instead Paul proposes to manage some belongings incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs rise in this case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first Jeanslade.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were bitterly embittered by the conditions of their financial separation.
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding, "always hoping for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on a more even footing.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with senior executives on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry about an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of positions that were convincing," said former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees had already managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which is composed of competing parties, keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views on the world.
Politico, who is very concerned with this story, reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is determined to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Attorney Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had in the past expressed false accusations and called them back.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "triggered to implement a system to manage and document the paper cream that Trump receives".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants still strive for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Get mail from Europol for most wanted criminals
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped.
The police all over Europe sent (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after criminals are not known, references from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday about the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, called Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications of publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionaires' series.
Some of the most wealthy houseowners of the West Midlands are once again standing on war feet with some determined travelers who have negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to challenge back a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road of Solihull, called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May, but without having been deterred by a trench excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the council of Solihull, who said that it was "unprofitable to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame in order to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull Police. We take the necessary legal steps so that they move forward as soon as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
With the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Unternehmengesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30 000 nights per year were lost and revenue also from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees entering the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Landratsamt, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not indisputable in the municipal council at that time.
But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of seriously interested people at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Foresthotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has long been a building shelter container in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovation work is done.
The floors were ripped out, blankets partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
Until March there is still much to do.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, there will be new windows built in.
Everything was to become "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a jewel of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Foresthotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand out wide, Scherer continues.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease at the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer.
The city's ideas were very similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
According to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he expects.
The exteriors are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudestadt is a good market".
Russia-Affaire: US-Sundermittler employs Grand Jury
In the Russian affair about US President Donald Trump, special agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The board has taken up the work in recent weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" in appeal to people who are familiar with the matter.
The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first presentations of the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have been accusing the Kremlin of having been specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be on several men who acted as adviser to the Republican in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the carpet.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump had personally moved into the centre and investigated the accusation that the President might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to file a charge.
Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as "indictments".
Mostly they are turned on when they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The board can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to question under oath.
According to the station CNN, preloads have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who were involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election campaign manager Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV that the deployment shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide on the filing of a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the board would be the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
On Thursday evening, in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supported any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president is not being identified.
There is no reason to assume that this has changed somewhat, the statement continued.
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this rumour, accusations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to investigate the case against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.
This triggered speculation about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president's press by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday that the special agent could no longer be released as easily as possible.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a giant iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has dissolved itself from the Schelfeis.
This was announced on Wednesday by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research.
The Colossus now floats north over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers and will probably need two or three years until it is melted.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger for humans does not depend on him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the decomposition of the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collisions of ice pellets in the region for about 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The Colossus that has now been mined was a part of the Larsen-C cell festival.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
As a result, it grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Northern this shale was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breakdowns a few years ago.
A complete Schelfeis had fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are some reasons why the Larsen C Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under stress and can be broken if a piece breaks off at a key point.
Melting shale ice and iceberg does not increase sea level, as it swims on the water and crowds out ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shale leads to the glaciers being able to flow directly into the sea and much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C shell ice is the fourth largest ice sheet in the Antarctic, with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more endangered position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and perhaps collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not trace the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change, in recent decades many ice-skeletons of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.
This long peak of Antarctica extends toward South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed itself around three degrees and is counting on the areas in which the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants home rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU demands that the employers' association withdraw in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the Kreistag 41 new posts in the administration go through.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for district management in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very popular.
Around 620 applications were available for places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.
Doctors and engineers are sought, among other things, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and face the lack of skilled staff in the administration.
The aim of the administration is to "draw up a concept for the recruitment and development of personnel" according to the wishes of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counter future-oriented short-term short-term short-term short-term short-term short-term short-term short-term short-term unemployment.
The overall concept should be based on internal and external orientation, show concrete measures for cross-exitists and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know so much earlier.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is from a right "competition of public employers".
In addition, a high number of employees leave the service as a result of illness or old age.
So the best time to act, so that no more places remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of Group of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently made a foust thick surprise in the circuit day when he publicly questioned the staffing costs cover and amazed the other parties.
Peoples want to see all the possibilities that allow them to leave the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should aim for a house tariff", according to peoples.
The CDU is thus trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff arrangements.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are available only if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone on NGO-Migrants lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had effectively worked with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only assess any accusations that are being made at the moment after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Yougend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew takes tugboat migrants on board, which are delivered directly to them by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the record of the prosecutor whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to be overshadowed by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have a mainly Italian police officer on board, monitoring their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to adhere to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, since they would not bring with them "essential changes or handicaps" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Laureate Organization is doctors without borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescues in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors have been fruitful.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Ascending and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, Berlin's outposts and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
Accommodation in Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There were points of view, partly on towers, from which you could look far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream plains.
Between them there were always longer increases, for the long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoints of outlook, coupled with "flowing" trials and moderate increases, were rising.
On the last two days many meters of altitude were again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in a healing sole in the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sports
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of being sweaty with wind and weather over the stadium lawn?
The fact is, e-sport has long since become a serious industry, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, million fans and huge tournaments with high gigs included.
This has also been recognized by the first federal leagues to become increasingly involved in this area.
In 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg started, followed by FC Schalke 04 and the last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that on this train still several clubs rise up".
The next weekend the FIFA Football World Association will organise the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamers of different clubs will compete.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual footballers.
"The real football team must deal in particular with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will also go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be present online much more in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What's the point?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are fought at competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And in the Asia Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly a need for habit.
Ingo Frobose has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German University of Sport in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But frogs also see problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist positively highlights the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
Players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for the e-sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the EUR 2.4 billion of football leagues, this is little.
However, the e-sport "was no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", writes Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already going on internationally.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a teaching subject, says Frobose.
According to Dutt, the first football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains Mr. Röttgermann, VfB.
Just to fall into nostalgia, and to clarify the old times, today is not enough.
It's about preserving the club's tradition, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You can't say that only football stays the same as it used to be."
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
The scandal of poison - burdened eggs has affected almost all the federal states.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are not found to contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter, convicted of the texts that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years of probation.
Carter was sentenced in June to negligent killing by Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until he called.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-looking eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She has taken no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any regrets."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she was completely sorry for."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy who said that there is "no day in which I do not condone the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will have with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "successed" by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person with whom I have been with since I was born every day is a pain I will always be with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump off a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murders against her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam of FC Bavaria
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern entrusts the Confed Cup winner with a great season - extra motivation does not harm it.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup of course no Philipp Lahm and also no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he made himself the tie assigned to him stop by the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first engagement as a Bayern chapter.
Well, the situation could have been better than 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of Coach Kimmich could say the same.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a leader in the C-Elf team of professionals from youth players, debuters and just out of vacation.
Sugarl is best distributed to those to whom you want to trust a lot, which you want to keep to the mood.
So those who have been chosen to take on the legacy of lamb can use a small extra motivation only well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old whistled over the field as a mini lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the row in the best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrecorded force.
He had a look at the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (didn't work; Renato Sanches to get the devil out of the performance of the Asia trip (also only possible); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not notice negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern trikot.
After all, that worked very well.
Süle ran up in front of Kimmich, Rudy, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build up the game a few times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not the same as we expected".
But he also showed a decent performance in the debut.
Game Shifting, Tempo Changing: "I was taken for this style as well".
As unusual as this Bayern world is still for new arrivals, one saw after the party.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich passed after a few crisp statements in the back of his new co-players.
There he heard of Süle an interesting sentence: "I have already noticed what goes on here.
At Bavaria you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new.
Alabama Motivates ÖFB Women
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern Legionary is actually a club colleague of ÖFB-Capitene Schnaderbeck and has been playing with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
The famous Bayern shower might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Business praises Wissing's Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is apparent after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs of Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V demand and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy: The gap between the 1 motorway between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the list of priorities of the country.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the west bypass Trier, which is in the pressing need of the Federal Transport Roadmap.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives to produce a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports falling down for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the existing master's degree and 2500 Euros if graduates become independent within ten years of master's education.
But the housework list for the country remains a long one.
In the planned road construction, there are facts to be quickly created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who wish to hire Wissing in the country business mobility, only 29 have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf’s CDU fact sheet refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that in 2017 and 2018, the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept of how it intends to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also sobering to see the current expansion of broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the supply of network services in an IHK survey only with a score of 3.4.
They complain about rising Internet connections and interruptions.
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she had already cleared the field for inconsistencies.
Audi aims to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company believed that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and thus referred to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of stifling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's faults, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but are driving back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States several employees were charged with Volkswagen; others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's motor development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the Audi authorities accused of installing a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profits of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join us, a raft runs through Munich on the morning of Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws to the Isar again on Saturday, there will be a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
I don't want to go into the building report.
On the raft you can see a large infotransparent.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love Is ...", the understanding of the Isar should be sharpened as a protective wild river.
Last summer the raft passed through the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a prudent and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nodules and laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters, the nostrils of his figures are his trademark.
The Argentinian also draws 85 and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he managed, among other things, as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris he managed to break through at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round-edge Mordillo figures rumble in drawings with the slate tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches, his dazzling figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand footsucker as a opponent.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he's more focused on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence Threatened by Climate Change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to the drought-remembering conditions and insects transmitted because of the diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very much needed for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, Züfte, Handel, Vaganten or a Landschnechtslager are supposed to be experiencing these days in downtown.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to provide perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the government's payroll or cartel's payroll, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest period from violence, and while the bodies are robbing throughout the country, there are more and more journalists there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is its editor and inspiration to Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders committed each year in drug trafficking and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are insatiable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all suspicious."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He managed only to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.
But on Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug-kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in war with Guzman's sons.
This release may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
As time went by, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious Maria Mors Cabot Prize for her report in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the protection of journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take over the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb one.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
You trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions as to how best to do their work and keep living.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean business, their secret runways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "Fear a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no phones were allowed. The days before, it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees C) in the shade of a tree.
They were assigned by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class fourth of Culiacan.
Half the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who themselves considered the governor to be unreliable.
It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are in de facto control.
Riodoke has looked at three main stories for this week.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé of the government expenditures, which focused on the governor's home town.
And there was a group who was abducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or what happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the Governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all the political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-calibre cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this room, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"Before we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of its slim body condition.
"Now all channels of communication have broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was surrounded by a storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Journalists throughout the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked that it be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "circumcised" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also by orders from politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organized crime.
Last year, the "Articulo 19" media watch group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants journalists.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a headline on the cover entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their homelands or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer as suddenly all their phones began to buzz.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the Riodoce website on mobile phones.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Siren cried nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept the guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his lead.
"How can you just think of it," said Bojorquez, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to report to the street."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to dodge their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a frightening one.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been preserved so well that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his scoundrel skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "unrested past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-kept armored dinosaurs ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived in the middle of the creed period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has puzzled researchers who describe it as "real remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant feeder is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just flash a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that even though it is covered with armor and similar to a walking tank, this plant eater was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white cover to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed better mixing in its surroundings and avoiding its enemies, experts say what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and can now be seen in the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully exposing it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although counter-shadowing is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds by far the animals currently living.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shadowing - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behaviors on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scupped skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalky season.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just tilted a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he’s asleep.”
The creative time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years in Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was immersed in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum it is the best-kept armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips, which ranged from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant feeder was flung through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is at his side, his five fingers are spread up.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambol position on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday night at the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass camouflage.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and forks.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) some 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon with a mass carambola.
According to the police's first data, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) junctions were reached during a thunderstorm of 30 vehicles, including probably trucks.
There was no information on the exact number of injured persons.
It's about easy to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A huge supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich, there was a return of about ten kilometres.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive handicaps on the counter-road - through numerous gifts.
The fire brigade noted the vehicle driver's identification mark, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident took place on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of an accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testing "Komfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing you know is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or one is deep in his work and just has a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the creator and awakens an unsuspecting or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Ticket check.
But the times of the interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the driverless ticket control.
You just confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"When the offer arrives, we widen it out.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket depreciation without the creator.
In order to use them, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which in any case most passengers already do.
It must also be purchased via the train app that DB Navigator purchased, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get into the train, you call his ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic degradation will appear in the test customers.
The train attendants are notified on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken over the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at position Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can sleep on, work on, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should be used by the passengers.
"If you want to travel through our train crew without checking your ticket, you can simply check in at the DB Navigator yourself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often drive train know that besides delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest inconveniences.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the ID card or otherwise a document you need to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and the creator at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet fully accessible.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.
Only one day after arriving in New York City, the St. Louis-born was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled through a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused as no one else on their feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She dropped off her cell phone to return to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman assured his rifle and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the type of murder we used to and we can call it typical."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and wept."
They booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whoes Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and of loss, of strength and of resistance, which consists of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state".
"You remember how I taught you when black people had to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her with me," Ferrell later said.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ecstatic racism, she is no different from the next black female child.
I feel that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-crime.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It has all come."
Later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind, Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless human cases, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death district inmates.
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. We are talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Life-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".
It insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was on the front line, because a life on these intersections is so much at stake as a black, gay woman.
You can sense their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to Ferguson on the street three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
From "dream" to "big idea": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold, the subject hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one of them says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Do not use man" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Great fool!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the other shops also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will be the end of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall almost weekly for many years now.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwives are always very popular.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the building of the gallery.
In other cities there are also.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: " Whether a direct marketer is located in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But it is probably not exactly low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary.
There's plenty of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are priced above.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, special stores are almost gone and what's left of them is probably going to disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't match for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in Bitburg.
Above all, where should the Farm Market Hall go during the construction period?
The old edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery would eventually actually come.
Or does the specter of bit gallery already make it possible to sell all the shops from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - construction projects in Bitburg no longer have any place.
When the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former secret service analyst forbade a 35-year prison sentence after she published classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website as a secret.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Suitable Similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits that someone could look like with this genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual, comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been talking openly since her puberty about identifying as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie, in which Manning sits clearly unsightly on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette dust and gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated museum became uneven letter friends, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, "Suppressed Images", which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would demand release of Manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas only a few days after the book was published was a welcome type of happy meeting.
There is also now a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further deflame the rigid divisions that he was supposed to resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason".
In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture" with her great signature (which "i" in her family name is provided with a heart).
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-footer of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist).
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a freephone in her hand from the U.S. Disciplinar barracks like King-Kong.
"If they colden your speech, they won," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then in the middle of the room she will be welcomed by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres, which collide like hordes of protesters.
It was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford seeking to kill
A national manhunt is in progress for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University who is being sought as a suspect after a man was stabbed with fatal injuries at a luxurious Chicago apartment.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murders because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the Cook County Court.
The documents say Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on leave and was excluded from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A university and someville College spoke in an e-mail statement saying that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US intelligence agencies in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to face the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 as well.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will conclude the WADA Roadmap in the near future" - the Russian Vice-Remier Mutko
Russian vice-remier Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage in meeting the road map criteria, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA Roadmap has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the WADA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organisation.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause Russia concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-Doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-Doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales point RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 under the Doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi's not selling eggs for the time being
This was communicated by the groups of companies.
It is a mere precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue to be expected, it is stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi which have been proven negative for fipronil-containing anti-lusters.
Aldi therefore wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.

Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the polls didn't work.
Answers were often vague, slightly helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, to address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide employee anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Erred said that they would gain a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity after an overview.
Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee flow and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to prosecute complaints from employees.
Now that the Convercent company is using, problems that previously were hidden and addressed by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only interventions.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well. Companies are doing well when employees are working and engaged.
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all, this can arouse disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you are asking for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Will that be your concern?
And whom do you not care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, said Erred.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems due to the speed of decision making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bonding of workers in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you'll lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes on at 23 o'clock, when a lot of UCLA football players are having a conversation on one side of the team's new field of practice on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotobe parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before they return to the Aquarius Football Center the next morning at 6:30 pm.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should begin at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the camp's start almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras' six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.
They are scheduled to do 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the change in the rules of the NCAA, even if they added another point to the many-time routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they've just pushed it through, they're still piling up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp ends, which, in view of the clear view of its fields, will not be an easy task, given a adjacent parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been advertised with footballs that cleared a protective network behind a torpedoes.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we've got.
I'm not worried too much about this.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify the fact-check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party fact controllers and then display their results under the original contribution, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It’s one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to the fact-checkers, which may display results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review was launched.
"In addition to the knowledge of the stories of third party factual auditors, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "linking article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotey has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaarish Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I love looking at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I've overrated my welcome greetings") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiousities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb.
He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "the wonder of years in which Aristokrates said "Oh, throw it on the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps representing who had something: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is depicted, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Favourites' family from Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite swindlers, keep making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to recruit inside."
After the end of his stay in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elemänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotey has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I'm gonna have to finish my fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Covered over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
By covering the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (around Thursday's show).
Until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)", they write on their yesterday-opened website.
"But we use this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable unique unique character."
Finally, it is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and the campaign a middle five-digit amount.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the Officer Corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the Prime Minister's office.
The talks were also attended by the five vice-remiers and the Ministers for Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, chaired by the Head of Government.
That's how the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as a drawer of the coup attempt.
Around 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiating in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow "God's gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the forces.
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Disappearance in the Military-Main Quarter".
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in lifting the towel ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The grand cleanup of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual lords of the country.
Three times, she called for her role as guardian of the secular state order.
After Erdogan's 2002 election, Erdogan pushed back the military power step by step, not least by calling for the European Union's reform agenda.
Former officers say Erdogan is actively advancing an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a not-called officer, who was looking for asylum for the coup for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, after the purges, there is doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to act.
The management structures and operational capabilities were "weakened", says NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the citizens of other countries spend Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to clean track for race track shuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the race-steig shuttle has always been disputed - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the maritime route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to secure the future of the race climb shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work is scheduled to begin on the route this year.
"The decision to continue ordering and refurbishing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route makes the country aware of this connection, especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was around 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future is currently being definitively coordinated, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as an operator already agreed on the technical details.
"This is why the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This is to be a regular event for the race team on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially with tourists.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by sufficient numbers of people to order it again on a regular basis.
The route is also in parts highly buildable.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharpy, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start to take their ascent seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them even more often," said Mr. Sharpy in publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," swams the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
Over the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subdued female traits, the invocations of rape, if you take a step on Frigid (hot here: contradictory) Farrah, worry you the most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their origin and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still stay on the edge of consumer culture provisionally.
But what penetrates the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market permits them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted about having sexually assaulted women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the encased bodies and the embodied eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to real women as realistic as technically possible (if even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, you are a good slave.
Or to express it in the 2017 way of speaking: maid
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense
It has become a binsenweisty of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. election have also split families in small size.
Around Christmas and the festival of harvest, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s choosing relatives.
We're all supposed to strangle to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but I am also aware that this will also pose considerable risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the depressing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the horrible possibility that one day his little girls will not throw us off.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump's Republicans of the right wing "normalize" who suddenly appear to be a concept of reasonableness in comparison to his standards.
Today, I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's ancient version of the madman - the dog on the auto roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both of which, compared to Trump, actually occur as a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are curly and the animals twist to look with fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: The views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, since here two years old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.
The poor woman in the department store was aghastly grinning, while I was tired of having the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with chest pain from prison
Pistorius left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he reported to have suffered from prison authorities in his cell after a case.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to take this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too cautious.
The national law enforcement authority said that they would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth classes from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the graduate students will go to the gym in the future, four to the real school.
Head of the school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, headed by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the Höhnerhof but is then released into freedom.
For this purpose, the mussels performed a musical titled "Der Adler im Höhnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken from it collapsed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and escaped.
After that, the three and four classes showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles, the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (kitchens), but it belongs to it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose was to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
The following was a thank-you to the colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who is always in the middle of lessons, and the parents.
The chicking time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she released her students only very reluctantly, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
Finally, all students had a song of summer time and holidays sounded.
Thereby, great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first classes have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV, announced.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal people was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, while an investigation is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free camp and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars at the diesel summit.
They aim to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Its retrofitting system has been ordered by the Federal Office of Motor Vehicles (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a timely implementation in the coming months, but not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has advised to write down any person concerned.
If an inspection is due in any case, it will be carried out within its scope.
How long will the overall upgrades take?
"Swear," Smetan says.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that car manufacturers have not yet voluntarily acted on the issue of the environment."
How long should the update take?
The upgrade itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is likely that foreign producers would be relocated.
Is there now a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of this.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there have so far been no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
The prize winner Lear, known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that is a burden to me".
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, will retire next year.
The job has already been written out - suitable candidates are, however, rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press conference.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks awaiting his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet completed the profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the best possible time.
Thus, due to the regular termination deadlines, there should be enough time for an evaluation.
Since Haslach acts as a sub-contracting authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding conclusions.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they can no longer fill these out, citizens would have to drive to Offenburg for advice.
But close proximity is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, varied projects will be on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
Only the latter will beat about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"Everything in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
For a city builder there is a large room for play.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, it was possible to react quite flexibly to many things.
"One can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors praisefully.
As the old town stands under monument protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits fit", when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the discerning city builder.
In any case, the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a client, "in the end, everything runs over my table."
With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place".
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a degree as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with a subject area of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of design and planning law.
The city building office is subject to construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land-based industrial affairs, management of urban properties, municipal works station with Bauhof and Stadtgärtnerei as well as Lower Baurechtsbehörde, including monument protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South railway line locked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were damaged so much that the freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, Witnesses had observed a rosarotian scooter and bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would have threatened the traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delaying minutes and the cost of the rail replacement traffic, the railway customers could also pay for the perpetrators.
Overall, the speaker said that a "significant" sum should be assumed.
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon, and rail traffic on the south railways could be managed without obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had been cancelled on Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overheads had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state of about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach cramps and blisters, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in the food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may result.
Experiments found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between a bacterial artery - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the colon microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet more tolerant of tryptophan, less inflammatory intestines, should the same system also work in humans.
The postdoctoral doctor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that had been kept separate, which had not.
It suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal chromosomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells but without them missing in mice.
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a intestinal chromosome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and developed the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers had L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether Tryptophan side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but gene defects related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genie" to Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder Roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the blues' preparation asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed its start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments.
"Three out of four to get, I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've given themselves great trouble."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots fled Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved across the United States in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns out, when Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD boss, Social Democratic Prime Minister always looked to Berlin before elections with a certain concern.
Just no interference from the party center, just no counterwind from the league - that was the most important wish of the electorate.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been observing the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even have been described in the approach with counterwind.
It was depth.
And one by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag elections, his red-green coalition lost its majority in the CDU and FDP opposition.
The Green Alliance Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the abducted Low-Saxon Green Member Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of voter's will.
Each Twesten must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs a SPD election fighter when the new hiobs message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, Deputy Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is present after the Green MEP's breach Elke Twesten to the CDU without a majority of his own government.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD Landesverbunden.
And nobody knows what's next.
The mise began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades of the time.
After the Landtag elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
It then became - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleide had smoothly killed the party.
In the weeks after that, the comrades struggled again.
Then, when they had just developed new courage, the G-20 summit of Hamburg came.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication after that he did pretty much anything wrong, what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust gas business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Low Saxon Prime Minister has been critical for a long time.
Mistakes of survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps that is precisely why, because over the past few weeks, has tried to place ever more emphasis on the Alliance.
The aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to be granted, since they promised a stabilisation of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
For this reason, the party's internal division of the Low Saxon Greens is basically not a fault.
And Schulz isn't.
For the time being, comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Your anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the abstinent parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratic-damaging how Mrs. Twesten places her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten was elected as a direct candidate, not because of her person, but because of the national list of the Low-Saxon Greens in Parliament, according to the Low-Saxon MEP.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, complains of an "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of the electorate four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Low Saxon SPD as the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He demanded to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there has been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funding for local centres III
Anyone who wants to rebuild his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives informed STEG Urban Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in Rehabilitation Area I between 1991 and 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the total funding.
The grant was still 60 percent in Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development as well, and not only to open new construction areas.
On 4 April, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe provided information that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The funding amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a renovation area now come about?
One will, as Schindler continues, investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in restoring whether interest exists in the planned area at all.
Where appropriate, the territorial boundaries could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country programme "Social City", which would then be the framework of the renovations.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be implemented on an object, i.e. per plot.
Finally, the rehabilitation area would be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation of the funds shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September this year, however, the inventory would only be carried out once, as part of which those involved in the refurbishment area will receive a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, the Statute decision is to be made as far as possible, so that the next year can start with the renovations.
Mr Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the abovementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about evaluating and deciding when to renovate and to what extent.
A renovation note will then be entered in the base book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that the participation of stakeholders was a key factor in the project's success.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that can be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land arch", which deals with, among other things, the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment arch", data can be made on the size, division and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "work arch" is only to be completed when operating in the building business rooms.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures would not be eligible.
Schindler stressed that the distribution of the means of conveying works according to the "wind dog" principle - who comes first is milled first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the participants a "tasteful" renovation.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant Anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for an additional charge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military information that was left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and White House executives made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire engine and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, deputy commander for aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained for so long until the lawn was cleared between 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the plane during the time.
The records made available by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the destination.
"A question that we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commandant wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commandant.
The event "Made in America" was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President launched the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But to request their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when, in view of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, the Presidential aircraft carried out taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to drop off the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 drill landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was one of the training needs of the flight crew for the month," said one official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 has no budget records for the Presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are well below this rate.
"Determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources."
According to an RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.
At this time, Sean Spicer, former White House press spokesman, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think like most Americans we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire engine.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News before tricky task
Top riders of the Second Tennis Bundesliga join the table rider Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will take place in Kiel tomorrow at 11 a.m. at the table-endritten Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games still flawless balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
In any case, team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, the imports from the high north are particularly important.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay, overlooking Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It will be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the high north trip is practical.
His debut for Blue White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella does not join the Bundesliga Party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in Liberec, Czech Republic, will be the first to play this season.
Until now, Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still on the ball at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel with the White Russians Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay will fill the box.
How America Can Harm OMV
Very fortunate Donald Trump did not work when he signed the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to pass the law," the congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he ate.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shone against the US advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU.
This is why investors of the local OMV have since been alarmed, who, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2.
The setting is huge.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by order of execution.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which group could defend itself and which could really hurt him.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be moved to the center in the hot series of Netflix
Despite the second season of Narcos, which Pablo Escobars Killer unveils, the series of Netflix is still far from over.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cartel.
Leaded by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune-500 company" only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, who invites US and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city sets 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With firm contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's dayrooms.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We were all very pleased".
Boiled is still outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked dishes.
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 day care centres, in 44 the children receive a warm meal at noon.
In the past year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the need is growing steadily.
"Now not only children who are being cared for for for 45 hours of the week are eating in the Kita at noon," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in 35-hour care when children stay until 14 hours."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service starting on 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are permanently assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the amount of hours.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"This way they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the Kita pipeline."
This is also a matter of healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is therefore useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
In addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown itself to be the most economical for the city in comparison to the cost of self-regulation and foreign distribution, according to the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-employed.
"But these hours do not get so much weight for about 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, president of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will compete in the elections in the provinces. Three women compete for the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition of international fighting to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will hand over the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.

Men trying to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed on the Kolpingstraße with friends around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old, however, declined the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.
The investigation's running.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to confirm its long-term commitment to production in its company in Glasgow with the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie's managers.
GMB Scotland said that the company had kept quiet about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "experienced first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland asked McVities to "announce that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed forward".
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General-Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and workers are strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and wealth, and against the background of Brexit, rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
A speaker from Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga likes to regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in her persecution of Neymar after she has made an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and highly paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president in front of this view?
When Manchester City 2014 showed interest in Blaise Matuidi's signing, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strong warning for every club that wanted to have one of the best players signed by PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand up to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter stationed in Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus arranged for the disguise of the vehicle's property damage of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident at B 215 between Stolzenau and Lee.
The driver of a VW Touran had to avoid a car on his lane and hitchhiked the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccam with his VW at 7:55 am on the B 215 from Stolzenau was coming towards Leese.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane so that he had to turn right.
The touran driver touched the guide plank.
The car caused damage to property.
The driver of the opposite car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident-damaged person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse relieves the Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German press agency, he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very helpful to see the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the events at that time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the report on violence in the Cathedral Patents was "twofold measured".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "deplorable and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "Grad medial manipulation" is striking, according to author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think it normal," says Scaraffia.
Also Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a very normal educational means" to "be done with naughty children, as I was one thing."
It found it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuses, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Full of injustice, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he sees the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by lawyer Ulrich Weber, responsible for the Enlightenment by the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused "with high plausibility" victims of assaults between 1945 and the early 1990s, 67 domspatzen.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, therefore, it can be said that in many cases, Domkapelmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accusers, many victims valued R.'s general humanity and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even link positive memories with it".
In his interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Patzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of violence for those in charge of protection at the Domspatzen Regensburg" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a chollerian and perfectionist, who became the exuberant when a domspatz did not bring any top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440 page report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more, which is why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually in it.
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of co-confidence or co-confidence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excess of violence at preschools also took place outside its sphere of action.
One can at least accuse him of experiencing too late or not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "resolution", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, present a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warmhearted", "popular", "real", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to rages.
Not only did he knock with chairs and throw the keychain on the ground, but he also spread ear-legged and too naughty boys on his hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread among parents, as in teachers, in the years 1960 and 1970s.
Do you know any of these training methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschools, these are, of course, Bagatelles.
One might wonder whether it has nothing more to do with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen upon him.
Many who have never understood him are still working hard at the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is, the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot has been reported on the subject of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral.
Will Georg Ratzinger also be put to the burden in the final report of any relationship or co-confidence with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapelmeister.
Not even the parents were consecrated.
"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," said one affected person alternately for the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a professional colleague of the perpetrators.
How do the Ratzinger Domspatzen-School assess the role of Ratzinger in the cases of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that he is expected ... to have opened up more intrusive or clearer or even more than to their parents, interns, trust teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - inconceivable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and/or their surroundings were pre-affected to him could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free of any co-confidence.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or of having brought him on display.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much of "waltexsesses" to read at the Regensburg Cathedral Patents.
The former Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this reproach?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed up and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence abuses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely the misuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between preschool and the high school of domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let us say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the director of the cathedral.
The entire horrific parchment pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and painted and suffered terribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domskapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, for he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
The theme of preschool was taboo, as most of the witnesses pointed out.
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed so much better treatment and even for many "paradise" states.
What else was at the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although discipline was already in place, there was no sadistic violence.
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, who concluded that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even link positive memories with him".
So, at most, the reproach remains to have looked away.
Despite all efforts, however, the report could only define two periods of time in which he was reported by preschool states.
The first time in 1970/71, when he started to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the circumstances?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it he pointed out that "the penalty for beating continues to be practised in preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as each of us may still know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those concerned might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
You can't say, though, that he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the penalty for beatings at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess's right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable, nor to what was committed in the preschool to resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was common at that time.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally worked out.
But at the same time, I need to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger give in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of beatings also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the doomspatzen played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal at all that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding the imperative discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, from which Regensburg's cathedral patzen, a nationally known so far (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) went on tour.
With cookies and bonbons alone, you don't even make out of stubborn boys a big singer and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-conquerion.
As what kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have truly come to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply believing and heart-loving people who can't be imagined to be just one fly to do something.
I get regular contact with him, visit him regularly, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict with them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral pats are grateful to him today for enriching her life and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respecter, to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And, please, once again, quite clearly: everything that is alleged to him is methods of education that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad we've been over this time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media scapegoat.
There's the evil intent behind it all too obvious.
The report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now it would be up to anyone, a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merit and who, without the exception of Bavaria and perhaps still of Germany, would not know the Regensburger Domspatzen, to finally leave himself in peace.
