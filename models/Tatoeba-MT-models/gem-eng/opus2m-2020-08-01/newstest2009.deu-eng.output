The Prague Stock Exchange falls to the bottom of the deal.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange began to open immediately at the beginning of Tuesday's business on Monday when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time there was the reason for the break-in on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Cases of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case occurred in the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses during the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was able to offset some of the losses later, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, and in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The stock on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 percent after the index.
"The timing for the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect the financial markets worldwide," said the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese Central Bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, further countries would be affected by the break-in.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support the plan.
In Bush's view, the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the entire economy.
The American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index dropped by almost seven percent, a similar break in it had recently been recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any indications that the draft would not get through in the House of Deputies, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress admits: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the US financial system.
The vote will take place at the beginning of next week.
In discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the US financial system, the US legislators reached a breakthrough of 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion kroner).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before publishing and voting on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services told Barney Frank of the agency Reuters.
According to the Senate, different data could probably be put to the vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor in boosting financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how to help markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on how a package should look to stabilise the market," said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday night with American finance minister Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsaleable mortgage assets by financial corporations that plunge financial corporations into severe losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan even further, but I think we are on target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia business
The global financial crisis is also strikingly reflected in stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of Nevada’s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at Congress.
This is to reassure investors before business on the Asian financial markets, which lie in the first time zone, where a Congress decision could affect the business on Monday.
But until now it is not quite clear when both American Congress Chambers will vote on the law, nor is there any doubt as to whether the negotiations could fail in a problem at the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount of aid for the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars are to be made available as soon as possible, as President Bush demanded.
But Congress can block the distribution of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, namely at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush appreciates positive progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained based on obtaining finance for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also pleased with the progress he made.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "appreciate the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, was told that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of discounts and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the programme and establish a committee to supervise the fund.
The Ministry of Finance is responsible for running this.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important to the market and to all Americans," Paulson says.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
According to Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
"That is because you do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government share the losses among themselves," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not decisive.
"It is very important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement that there will be a adoption is at this moment the most important thing," said Marek.
Duel on Messer's cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost any mobile MP3 file can play, no MP3 player can phone.
That's why, of course, it looks like it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons why an independent player should be placed.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owners.
Certainly, you can hardly buy yourself a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once such musical innovations do not appear on LPs, and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is also the case with the music on the move, i.e. with compressed music, expressed in simplified terms - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand crowns, but also a Pink Floyd fan will probably be able to use a heavy headphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don't even create meaning.
No modern device should be used as universally as the telephone.
Besides the primary functions, the phone and the Sims, it can play music and videos, both recording, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and maybe can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV photograph.
But the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile phone, the more often you will have to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for longer than ten-twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That's why you should expect cheap cell phones to not be able to play more than a few hours of music.
If you call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you won't have this problem, even the less good keep out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charging.
There is another problem when you want to replay the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and also not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will be finished without any reduction with the tiny memory cards used in mobile phones.
You don't need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can more
When selecting a specific device, you should examine the life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and, of course, the ease of use.
Is music especially for you and listen to it every day just for a short time in the tram, then enough any mobile phone that plays MP3 files.
Which really can almost any phone.
You don't have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widely used, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument in itself as to why you should put on a musical handy.
Unfortunately, the provider's offer is bad and usually limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of music sales (see it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone carries most of it.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
It is important, however, whether you are wearing headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker that has almost any mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The greatest advantage of the music handicrafts will probably be in the prize for many.
The cheapest costs usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a quite decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically matured phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is, in turn, in easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar when operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of an improperly employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrifying bill for data transmissions.
Which device to use now
Also the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a map, there are enough 2 thousand crowns.
But beware.
For base models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are usually supported.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and want to buy yourself an inexpensive MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent operating buttons for MP3 and the operating comfort comes to the one of a single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide you with MP3 players from the above mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be waiting for long.
The fact that the Czech mobile service providers work at all among the most expensive in Europe, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, it is likely that there will be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile phone providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
How come prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a battle story.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of well over 100 %.
Mobile providers, on the other hand, would like to scoff at the fact that there is an extremely high level of competition in the Czech market.
This is often the responsibility of the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often said that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has very many opportunities (by the way, it would probably hardly find any frequencies).
But there is still one possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market led to a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile operators had to react to.
There were voices similar to those in the Czech Republic before the entry of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market.
However, it has been shown that there is space for such providers and that these can be really successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for long.
In February, we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country's fifth largest provider.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and text messages, which, however, is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors in the UK.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to focus on an uncluttered target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Echte Kerle choose Mobilking - the provider they like and trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar approach could be adopted in the Czech Republic as in Poland.
The press spokesperson of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubted this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment based on most virtual providers.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service provision."
In the Czech Republic, mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
"We speak of an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press spokesperson of the Penta financial group, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile provider has long shown the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiating progress," said the press spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe we'll have better times.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech Republic for a fully-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has a large specificity vis-à-vis other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň from the Telefónica O2 press department in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other suppliers also point to the Czech market's specificity.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's press spokesperson adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project that could be built on."
And she adds: "T-Mobile's network will hardly show up with a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment, we should already have a specific offer to think so in the short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we regard as the best from the point of view of customers.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to look for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The behaviour of mobile operators is easy to understand, another provider was called more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that suppliers can draw on a string when it comes to something is also evidence of the long-standing development of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time that U:fon came to the market, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidence of the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is right now as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player in the market itself and in particular its services would impose high demands."
However, in view of this approach of mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, is not competent to intervene in economic competition in Czech countries, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries.
It has the sole responsibility to protect economic competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, related to this whole problem his very typical attitude.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile service provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile service provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," says Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising by representatives of the providers.
This is more than questionable by an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, ensuring that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking to note that the almost already touching agreement between the three mobile operators that results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gas price at the gas stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way in the matter.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their market behaviour.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecoms regulator," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual provider.
And the mobile phone provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a similar way.
In doing so, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The shifting of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications has not been successful, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS only have to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's all right when no one's looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider, of which there are just several in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
Usually they are companies operating in the multi-level marketing sector.
Own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company is acting against the operator as a classic company customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a breach of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal, which may lead to the termination of cooperation with the corresponding society," answered Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not go hand in hand with the controllers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, it may be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such an approach.
Indeed, the activities of these companies do not result in negligible profits, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for such kinds of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their name, so they cannot have full access to it as normal mobile customers."
However, the ČTÚ would have to be at least strange.
In addition, another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
Before such an approach, mobile providers close their eyes, why do they block themselves against a virtual provider?
It is to be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to satisfy itself with the statement of the providers, they would not know of it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers led to a significant price drop in the various services.
Virtually in all countries where virtual providers have been created, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened at these very moments, which did not try to protect the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
If it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves all over the case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot lose the impression that in these cases ambiguity in the competences is more than favorable.
But let's not throw the flu into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may soon be reinvigorated.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will then finally call no more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National anthem Where is my home country on the occasion of the Czech state's day of celebration.
The hymn was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choir version and in an instrumental version.
The composition took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo versions, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear dictation with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that a harmony can be established," said the conductor.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first performed in 1834 on the stage of the Standetheater in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven State symbols remained after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
The Prague transport companies will also transport on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague's transport companies as a date on which the first passengers will enter a subway, tram or bus instead of a paper ticket with an electronic coupon in their pocket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the open card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it on their chipcard at the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have been available on the Internet since yesterday on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon hours by over four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues.
You buy the coupon on the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points there is also a switch with trained staff at the disposal of travellers, who advises the interested person when buying the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the Martin Opatrný project.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can also be played on self-service vending machines on the Opencard, which are mounted in some subway vestibüls.
What do such vending machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket devaluers, the passengers may have noticed them already in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be eighty by the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls a vending machine instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is simple.
You only have to import the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon is self-playing.
The electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area as of tomorrow.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices that allow them to check the validity of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organisation Ropid. This organization compiles the timetables for Prague's transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the checkout.
The driver thus controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can go to the self-service vending machines where the coupons are played on the card.
Here the information about the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets demanded a referendum from the United States
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans had asked for the annexation of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans must have turned to the U.S. president in 1945.
This is reflected, among other things, in a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is today stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian scientific library.
In the letter, the Germans of Krumau asked the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken on the basis of the Munich Hitler agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units enter, not as oppressors and enemies of the German territory, but as liberators," says a letter signed with the words "People to whom the fate of the Sudees lies at the heart."
Since the follow-up to Czechoslovakia leads the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - to assume that they would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over protection over the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you are addressing a foreign state that is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Allies," read the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is said to be the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the spirit of the Bohemian Germans, it would be sufficient if he instigated in the Bohemian Forest Gau a referendum on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound naïve in modern knowledge of post-war history, he does, in the opinion of some witnesses at the time, draw a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans.
Although the Bohemian Germans had at least to know that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to such an opportunity at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Still others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who came from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the Marine on the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, he believed that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This is also how the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday could be characterized.
The authority of Minister Aleš ʿebíček promises to remove drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The 150 million crown campaign will run on television, on radio, in cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to reduce drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remember to strap on before the start of the ride.
The campaign wants to raise the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a plate.
And the word "pay" is then written in a smile of blood.
This should mean that one can pay a moment of inattentiveness with one's own life.
The spots will "shock" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic images of victims of accidents.
It promises that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and whip applies to the riders.
Sugar bread means that when they drive red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said the traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Martin Kořán hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his view, it is less effective to draw the attention of drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static panel that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the surrounding area, and the drivers will no longer perceive it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, has voted for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria could be achieved in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview, which was printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give up a similar percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, alluding to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the words of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Temples and Sacred and Historical Places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan hills
Olmert advocated a withdrawal from the Golan Heights of Israel, which he felt is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
This, however, would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," Olmert said.
"The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up in order to get back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (shinic) Hezbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (shinic) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal on the bus?
The law doesn't know them, in a long-distance bus the bypass is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Student Agency company near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and travelers may walk and walk in the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, in which a twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman was sitting at every accident next to the driver, on the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment when the Steward carries coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the letter of the vehicle.
If this is not planned on the bus, travellers must sit.
The distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the Ministry, and this did not first agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travellers may go to the toilet while travelling, if they have their seats," he announced his position.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the concept of vehicle attendants, but its rights and obligations do not define it," adds the spokesman of the Hanselka Ministry.
On the other hand, the director of the department of road vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law covers this issue afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product authorisation also has standing places.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, city buses with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing places with the maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the airplane, the expert says
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in Stewards' movement on board a bus.
"In a liquid mode of travel, not many dangers are at risk, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Also here is not sure when turbulence comes, and the stewardess can kick its head."
"However, if a bus is tight, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The security of the stewards must be clarified by internal regulations," he says and also believes that this issue is not fully resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider his profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I will strike him.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers on boarding.
This would also reduce costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin explains the lack of Stewards in his bus. His company, however, only operates a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, but we'll fight back from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end with some fatal accident," he had not said quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a scheduled bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was killed, who had worked for society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without blinking from the stand and had blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura argues that the two seats had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved for remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but will also expect a financial compensation from the debtor.
A law amendment?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring about a legal regulation on which a thirty-member expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to any concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards' activities to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, who has the competence to control the safety of buses in the police and occupational safety authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB board of directors does not lack the staff of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt deka bank, "the central capital market house of the savings bank financial group" could be created, says the letter that became known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive start to further alliances in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it is read if a board of directors wants to demonstrate their ability to act in difficult times.
Because the beaten WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the Federal Financial Services Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian government recently made clear the time needed to find a future solution.
The link between the deka bank, which has always been known by savings banks customers because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has, however, been mentioned for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although at the end of August Deka Bank Chief Franz Waas made the presentation of the half-yearly figures, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a state bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Management Board of the Deka, which is each half-carried by the Landesbanken and the savings banks associations, has commissioned the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks have, of course, just started, so it is said at the financial centre.
The deka bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003 it looked like a moment when the Deka bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
But there was nothing out of this tributary.
The plans had only become public, and the Hessian government opposed the participation of Helaba.
The other two houses did not find one another.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have been thought games about a connection of the deka bank with state banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about a meeting with his home.
Regardless of this, however, it seems to mature the realization that a convergence of the various public-law houses is a necessity.
After the election of the Landtag in Bavaria is over, BayernLB could first move closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba this is not necessarily a good news.
Should the pressure increase to further mergers, the partners will gradually proceed.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which participates in the Helaba with 85 percent, has set a stop at the beginning of the year.
At least stay the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only the one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit each other.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which business model the future ability of Landesbanken should be ensured, was not yet answered by the German savings bank and giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a decomposition of the West LB, which is not, of course, desired there.
This is also the case in the letter of the board of directors there, that there is certainly a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be put under a hat with regard to the combination of individual units with the deka bank will still be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italienerwochenende"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, is a massively built bearder and proves to the about 200 October festival travelers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, will start at 23.45 this evening four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", probably arriving at 6.30 pm.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, in a bus travelling exclusively Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing next to their flag, they have celebrated already at night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and a glasses with broad silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours are this year alone.
At night, day after day on the meadow, at 10:30 p.m.
Staying would only mean unnecessary spice, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome round with Kaiser-Bier, brewed true to the Bavarian Purity bid, the health insurance and the German-language tour guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Soon it will be quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is kept in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where there are also several other buses with Italian marks on the motorway 8 just before Munich take another break.
When Marcos group finally arrives in the car park near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, along with the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors to the beer tent go up, it's called running!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not at the front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow hats will be distributed on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to drink.
"The security officers show that we are doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they'll be gone!"
Third, "Today evening point half eleven to find out again here!"
And it's going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap is tied as a sign to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
You want to be armed for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italienerwochenende".
There are no exact figures; the speech is of 50,000 who make their way across the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are to be from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which provides a national statistics in which the Italians take first place in front of the British (about 60 stakes) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical supplies.
The farm is especially popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only in the past week.
How good it is that the politician used the word "relatively" and also implicated that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis developments.
Because it has now arrived on the weekend.
The Munich Real Estate Funder Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion-dollar credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday, the loans amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate only had to make up for the part that it also needs.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background is losses with the daughter Deppa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has given money, the public financer had refinanced himself extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the distrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves fell by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero over the same period of the previous year, income from subscriptions to receivables and certain securities and from the liquidation of provisions in the credit business by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only higher revenues from refunds of deferred transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Deppa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regime and from the provision of business to corporates had the reduction in earnings of around 16 percent still been moderate.
After his privatisation in 1990, the former State Financer had first speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed to Aareal Bank.
Because the traditional state funding was too low, Deppa had become more involved in infrastructure projects and financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and international diversification.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make write-offs that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it is called rather indeterminate.
The fact is, the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been shortened by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure funder since Deppa's takeover.
It is more dependent on the refinancing of the Interbank market than other institutions, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among the banks is again largely sealed, as the banks had their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding annually for a part - about 50 billion euros - of the Deppa's loan portfolio.
According to the Communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the Group’s financing needs are covered by the loan at the foreseeable time and the company is shielded from the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international money markets.
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungspüstung (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
In fact, it is not inconceivable that funding does not have to be used to the full.
But neither is the opposite.
After the late Sunday evening the hearing after the bank was still before the insolvency, the at least temporary rescue could not calm the minds.
The share price breaks down by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond rates are quite good.
While the senior debt is hardly moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more clearly reflecting.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009.
Hypo-real-estimated mortgage bonds previously appear to be a speculative investment alternative, so their worth has to be considered depending on the stability of the international financial system, after the significant strengthening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis to the house with the adoption of the Deppa.
As long as the central banks, governments and the less well-off commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it may be assumed that the pension will be extinguished in due time.
Or it will happen, what hardly anyone dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports which have been transmitted with the sub-nationalisation, the probability of safety has now become only a legitimate hope.
This should, above all, prepare long-term believers for some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their engagements.
However, short-term investors may use a closing line to make a loss contribution for future tax payments on price gains later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, introduces herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to pee: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had a ball before school.
I live at the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive for 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't walk.
The beginning of lessons at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
From 8:00 a.m. on, the students interfered until around 20 a.m. a brief meeting with the teacher begins, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was on my way to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guest mother, blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the platform and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language over two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all been cuddled, peeped and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly got to my place.
The girl next to me had quite a big grin, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really upset.
Everyone talked and peeped and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all her Bentos unpacked.
My guest mother had also made me a lunch box - this is something different than the tedious German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some sort of meat in tofu mantle.
Most of the time I don't have a pale shimmer, what exactly I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's clear that everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, perhaps, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then crafts particularly artfully - hoping to get to know the boy more closely at the break.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And in order to understand the comics and culture in it better, I started to learn a bit Japanese at some point.
So it was quite clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a feature for tradition, customs and customs.
And that's where you put a lot of value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
A rat or a sheep flees in danger, does that mean that she also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you check if they feel the same way if they behave the way we do?
For several years, the "Edge" magazine has published contributions from famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and cut down on the questions of sensitivity or general consciousness, we enter the impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
If a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it sets itself up dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which leads some scientists to a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the rest of the primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, was probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it can be analyzed as something internal and subjective, neither measured nor, because of the special hardware, based on our own experience, his research poses great problems for us.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially on the example of visualization.
However, in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, they focus on the neural correlates of consciousness rather than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal cortex for the state of visualization.
So what happens to the sensations?
I bring her back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his own activities conscious brain.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the brain localized defense system (or its consequences, like physical reactions) is evidenced by memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely linked to the regions of Cortex, which distinguish primates and especially humans.
Linked to the linguistic nature, there are fine degrees of sensitivity, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others alongside us.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities in the body regions of Cortex and the brain stem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-gain sensations.
In theory, I cannot contradict that, but I do not think it is possible to prove it.
Pankseep argues what appears to rats and humans like fear, probably also feels this way in both cases: How, though, can one check whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A sheep flees at risk of fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot prove an equality of experience.
While the neural comparison helps further: rats and humans have similar brain stems, sheep, on the other hand, do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this to people, how would you prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
At any rate, progress at the neural level is waved here, as long as the same is measured for rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, if not sensations, I don't know if they exist.
You might think this is shortsighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly running against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
Even the number of EM stations may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep our eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Sportminister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced descent only in the past season for manipulation, and finally even the league had to be postponed in the short term.
Indignant Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about Privates - and is now having trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outete her abandoned Dennis Quaid as a adulterer.
He's foaming - and he's beating back.
Late Rosenkrieg at the ex-marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after her divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpretentious fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week Meg Ryan had first expressed himself on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud did not reveal it until after the divorce.
Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" was the reason for the soul striptease - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband clearly failed: "Unforgivable," said the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News, "meg repeats and reconstructs the story of our relationship".
It is also "a pity" that the 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that mean a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the page above: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that is doing well."
Prices for tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become more affordable again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its accounting data from the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, nights in many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend in Paris and Rome was most evident, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
American Express sees the weak dollar rate that has led to a "decreasing travel of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London were also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices keep a record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed up:
On average, passengers in the economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights even cost up to 29.2 percent more.
From April to June, the prices of the economy class tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices even halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the price break was the slowdown in economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the open-skie agreement, which liberalises air transport between the USA and Europe, increases the competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation were the deletion of unprofitable routes by airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – these alone were 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay is still unable to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein enlarge breaking landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into play late and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precise, she went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," said Hermann Rieger in the cabin passage of the Hamburg Arena.
Much was not lost in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most people sat back in their seats.
Rieger was the HSV's physiotherapist for nearly three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than some of the missing actors.
And so his request also found hearing in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and lifted his thumbs in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, chief coach of Hamburg.
Its command will have sounded similar: With gate two!
The implementation has not been completed.
"There wasn't anything nice to look at today," Marcelle Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wanted it more relaxed.
The 1:0 (1:0) have been credited by the Hamburgers to Mladen Petric's headball hit (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
On this Monday, the SV in Hamburg is 121 years old.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to organize this," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular intermediate evidence stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late engagements - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goaltender Petric and the Jansen, who has been recruited by FC Bayern - can be found slowly, but not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote:
On Wall Street, there's fear.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke down the Dow Jones by 700 points.
That was the greatest loss of points within a day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At 8:30 p.m., the world's most important stock market barometer with a good five percent in the minus recorded 10,579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs gave up almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
Within the framework of the rescue plan, funds will be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at one time, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive equity option notes from financial corporations that could be redeemed in the event of price developments in order to reduce the burden on the central bank.
Stock prices in Europe and USA in the downwards
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the US do not resolve investors' doubts.
The share price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate falls and tears down the Dax downwards.
The US Index Dow Jones loses by the state despite the planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deeply reduced the German stock index (Dax).
Despite the rescue action of the Federal Government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's share lost about three quarters of its value, which Commerzbank gave up more than 20 percent.
The Dax was clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
The stock markets around the world got on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar bailout package could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back to business.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809,25 points in the first trading hour.
The US House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially yielded 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18,286,90 points.

The commercial and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused impotence: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity could not be quite correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for nearly 18 years.
You are now threatened by cold weather because of the fuel lines that are soon to be fired.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, the researchers have been surprised for years: the flying bodies do not behave 100% as expected by the old gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him Swing-by-Anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously assumes an attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
After all, according to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter accounts for well over a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their abductors, the tourists to Egypt were to be free again, as the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
Six hostages must have been killed in a shoot-out before the release.
Five Germans were abducted in the south of Egypt.
Loose money negotiations are already due.
Again and again Germans came to the sight of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged away in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabic TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and safe, reported Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition should already be on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to the information provided by an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were ready to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It had "only gone to receive the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported under appeal to a German mediator who delayed the release of the hostages because the kidnappers feared for their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by her stepfather has led to the death of a woman, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after facing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found out that Mrs. Randle was killed at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife got divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found out that Mrs Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time on a voluntary basis, was persecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "delivered her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she has killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession, who ended up like this: "I used to tie them up and connect their eyes."
"I didn't need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely alien fetishist and for their victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unsavory story ends with the victim's suicide.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to Stephanie's father and mother, of her actions on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data shall be charged with:
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act".
The man was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC Defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally by the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecution recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified assessments of Al-Quaida and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could be in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid if Bradford & Bingley's loans are extinguished.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is charged to the 700 financial corporations that accept the deposits each year.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions which have acted prudently ... are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions which were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to raise 81 million pounds for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the upturn of property are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will monitor all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010 interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both non-partner organisations, their members will have to pay higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts for the costs.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations of a consulting firm have been carried out.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they wish to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Prior to the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied bail
A court in Bangladesh refused a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Her defenders said that the court refused bail regarding the charge of 50 million Taka ($729,700) to have been extorted by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first grant her unlimited freedom.
Correspondents say that, although their imprisonment has been granted in order to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear within the framework of their release whether they will be able to remain free when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail claim because it says she does not need to receive a security deposit because she is already on detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers insist that they require a deposit to return from abroad to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
It is expected that Sheikh Hasina will return home after October 17th, said an Awami federal party president on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but was released from prison in June to seek medical treatment abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children have not been vaccinated in the recent anti-Polio initiative in Afghanistan because of the violence associated with the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or impede the thousands of personnel carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses proceedings in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its action against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share of the competing channel ITV.
The Competition Court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to under 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully blocking NTL, now renamed Virgin Media in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB had raised doubts about the independence of ITV, which led the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced its intention to give up its voting rights.
New investigation in the US Public Prosecutor's Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a Special Investigator to deal with the termination of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice criticising the actions of administrative staff.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
The specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now going to clarify whether the officials interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his main recommendations was the appointment of a specialist investigator with the power to force the witnesses to make a statement.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice in December 2006 deposed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that public prosecutors would be dismissed for poor employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others had refused to investigate accusations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
US prosecutors are assigned to investigate and prosecute legal cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the Ministry of Justice Alberto Gonzales, the Attorney General, has been shot for the dismissals and has resigned his office in the final effect.
A number of officials from the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General's report has addressed the role of Gonzales critically by bearing the "main responsibility" for the dismissals, giving up his leadership role and showing "extraordinarily disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former Chief Advisor of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loves epic song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honoured for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell" during the music award ceremony "Q Award".
The singer who next week in London will accept his special golden prize during the award said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" cites the nominations for the award of this year, after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such materials as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in 1979 in the UK and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeats after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to give up concerts due to acute head inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscured street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
However, it is difficult to tell even experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from First Street to the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty street than an active road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-plaster Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short street, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential building and is responsible for the road, has no interest in obtaining it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district administrator in the Municipal Council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street would refurbish pavements and seats designed, among other things, for a café where the company would like to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not want to have it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost street and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Department of Building Protection, said that it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm, owned by Philip Minthorne, was divided between his numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument, which was closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is probably most famous as a backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scraps, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged split of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York", has published a part of the discussion of the city's history of Extra Place, which was published in the "The New Yorker" magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end, which remains dark even during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying past rain showers.
With a few exceptions, the road looked just as recently on an evening.
A rat ran through the back of the road, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was on the ground not far from a fresh bundle of sorted newspapers.
Some passersby said that they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up somewhat.
Fields, added that according to his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debates on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environments
In this issue of "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in Californian studies and director of the Department of Education Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's campaign mentions that "the probability of successful completion of school by African-American and Hispanic students is lower than that of white students" - what is true.
In particular, Obama's education plan recommends a bilingual transition phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in education.
Consider Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from families with low incomes.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success was achieved with methods other than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment. That’s exactly what Obama is supposed to take note of, according to the headmaster Linda Mikels.
This approach places importance on the almost exclusive use of English language in technical education.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would enter the classroom and not be able to recognize him anymore.
"It works," she remarked, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other English students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational positions within its own party (the national associations of educational institutions have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions of Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "English only".
Instead, he said, "You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices are falling as a result of renewed economic fears
The oil price on Monday has fallen sharply due to fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The New York Stock Exchange's oil futures fell by 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday the price has dropped by more than $20.
Over the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken both by financial turbulence on Wall Street and by powerful whirlwinds in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the July prices had reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel to then rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors were worried again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on weekends, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the most recent chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial group Fortis.
After analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank have written to investors in a communication that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the commodity markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The analysts of the Bank have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 have decreased by 20%.
Team record set up by series in the second quarter
Internal defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been in the Jets Tricot more often than anyone else in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a non-profit game into a triumph march.
"I've never seen anything like this before," said Ellis.
After a slutty game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon in which her developing collaboration made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once took off as an outside defender and the other ten seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't worked very hard," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted no matter what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing catch, the defense quarterback took Kurt Warner apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis caught an accident and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another pass and caught him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced by Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinals had won the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20-yard shot into a 34-to-0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever made in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
Both answers, because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without achieving a single one, Mangini said, "Trust me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Affluent Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think he is the best long-distance runner of all time, after he broke his own record on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon and became the first person to make the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus established his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least a world championship title or a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie released the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which in retrospect was perhaps exaggerated that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at target - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya to cross-country tracks, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had had cramps in his vein two weeks ago and therefore could not train a week.
Apparently he was refreshed after a break and did not come back rusty.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything went perfectly well.
I resumed the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end of the day everything was great."
He was criticised for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - that he overly orchestrated his race, that many of the world's best marathon stars generally avoid relying too much on the race leaders, as if it were a railroad race, and that he places world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassie as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the tempomakers had left behind.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to separate himself from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a remarkable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result ever.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She planned her way by having a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners torn out, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Ascal Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the tightness in the lives of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the emanations of the leisure parks in the vicinity of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three cockpits, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that she describes – and which made her a tourist destination by including her in the Florida travel guide produced at the time of depression by the Bundesschriftstellerprojekt – is, in many respects, a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is so independent, virtuous and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he does not know what is missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many continue to feel sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our story is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a parishioner of the oldest church in the city.
It has to be right."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice the country average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are proud as well as on the hat.
And so rightly did the concerns about Eatonville's image actually start with Zora, as here all call Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "They Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a street that leads through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the locations of black history and human drama.
Naughty as Oskar both in real life and in literature, Hurston readers led to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Besides the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds, which always takes care of Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what always fits into hour rooms."
In just a few hundred words Hurston thus brought Eatonville into contact with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty that were full of sexual allusions.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston got busted into the city, she did this mostly without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and dressed with pants, in a city that today imagines something of her venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he rocked in his chair, on a backed terrace overlooking the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was baptized in all probability.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were abandoned.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them along with most of the world.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary longstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in the big style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or their heritage in the least," says Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the church.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred to the community.
"At this time, a lot of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff at the people sitting out," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed there.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel questioned the request of the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision against the school council "politically respecting instead of my race" in the case of Brown.
People today say that although in some respects the abolition of racial separation was positive, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged his teacher in the morning and they hugged his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the nonprofit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who have moved over prejudices, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made his way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookshelves, and again made it part of the American literary canon.
The long-distance project came at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the public eye.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-track long-distance street revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the long-distance road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more train trips, like Rachelle Munson, an attorney who has been going to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back street in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today it is 90% black.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
Most interviews require permission in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston festival grew, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other race and ethnic group in America.
It is the genuine love of this city that can be heard in Mr. Franklin's Neffen's voice, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or in the police who could use some help according to him.
And even the disciples, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here with us in New York, we speak fluent Financial Latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge funds administrators who have the monopoly in New York have the worst horror work day since the 1929 stock market collapse.
The suppliers still push with loud flaps the metal tea trays along side side steps and transport tablets loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still roam between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 t-shirts, hanging on a yoke-like bar on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the food stands on the sidewalk and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a day of the week between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of all the world's downfall speech.
Although I had decided to lay my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or pay money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, tourists ask after the way to Macy's department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most people in front of me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal banker with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
In contrast to me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had removed money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a construction savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in a state, saying that they treat their customers like families.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went into bankruptcy and as the last Friday of New Yorker went home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that has savings facilities worth $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of a further collapse, the office and shop workers brought the bares in front of me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank that is responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial latents in recent weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket took so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and their demeaning CEO Dick Full as if she were blaming a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, is rid of our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I changed, I don't go in a risko anymore."
Muslim tombs damaged during legal trek in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right-wing Pertei Vlaams Important, take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 in order to represent the organisation "Cities against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extreme right party, of having significant profits in the country's parliamentary election.
On the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun Cemetery near Linz in an organized action, according to the police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this to be an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said she was "deeply shaken" about the news of the burial, which took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria, after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the alliance for the future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received almost 30% of the votes, stood for a strict anti-immigrant law in their election campaign, and some of their election claims were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on head cloths and Burkas and even made known his aversion to food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights are the most politically strong bloc in the country, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Excursion barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who was convicted of sexual abuse by children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter set up a six-month barrier after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The Kent police were granted last Thursday to impose a ban on foreign travel after presenting to the judges evidence of glitter's criminal punishment for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford County Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning law firm.
EIn spokesperson of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at the Ashford District Court the permission to prevent travel abroad from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not present personally."
As required by the Sexual Criminal Register, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of five years.
The Kent police said that they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokeswoman from Kent's police unit said, "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our opinion, it is easier to control someone in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the chief concern of Kent police to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimize any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through the passport control and he flew to Hong Kong after some time and again.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Last but not least, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been detained in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the Minister of the Interior Jacqui Smith was calm and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no ruffles, no costumes for appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artist
On the other hand personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatres on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of the photography of flamenco, reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is getting bigger from day to day, explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on stage.
Very normal people on portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to hold the characters of the greatest flamenco master with the photo camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the image, giving the image the modernity and idea, as the farmer Flamenco understands: 'music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not just the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the artist's personality, his character, which seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that is visible in the form of hearing, of being, and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Famous personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to take up this idea two years ago and realize it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' ('SportARTproject').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me a great deal of time to photograph the people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, be it for a short moment or a longer time.
I think in the field of photography the portrait is the most difficult species.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of today's flamenco portraits entitled 'Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called La calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the road la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he's just writing is 'a great attitude'.
He does not yet know where the story takes place and what it is, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved into the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he is engaged is 'a great talent' and 'everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I were wise, I would not have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at some point', so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and gave her voice to most of the people present, is compared to the old edition of `Our Mutual Friend' and can be seen in the theater of Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him who noticed that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to go through everything: how his vocation to literature was created out of 'extraordinary adventure', out of 'joy at reading' and out of 'more experience than before'; how he writes and 'discipline preserves' to complement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his profession and what 'memory images' are the basis for his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,' said Vargas Llosa, who claims that it causes 'effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I asked the writers 'not to leave the ease' and 'take responsibility' for his vocation.
At the festival in Pozoblanco the weather did not play with: bullfighting fell out in part.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, with which the festival was to be concluded in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
With the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to unconstant weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained that the second intended bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfight.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more through galloping than through his bullfighting.
Even worse was El Juli, who passed through the arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with Buh calls.
In Álava, two persons wanted to avoid the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they took refuge.
It looked as if they would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police persecuted her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State reported.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the Region of Álava had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to perform the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid the control.
The police started the persecution until the car stopped at the edge after a few kilometres. At the moment, the drivers got out of the car to flee a country road to a forest area.
The police in the city of Ertza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to precise laboratory analysis and to deflect the bundle from other police departments.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was 'doubled', so that it did not match the distinguishing sign indicated in the vehicle papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for the falsification of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, was able to flee but also to determine the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to a police station for hearing, and he will be presented to the detainee in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
The actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of an unknown drug.
A Witness observed how she tried to get out of her park in Montecito in a rather strange way, reported to the California Transport Police's magazine 'People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through the gas pedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking area, and as she drove backwards, she caught up with her sunglasses a few times.
A little later, the Witness, who at first probably didn't know the actress, saw Locklear on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'anxiety for locklears'.
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in her car standing across the street blocking traffic.
'She seemed unorthodox', so they brought the policemen to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed herself to be cooperative, excessive drinking was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the speaker said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an undetermined substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation at around 19:00.
Two months ago Locklaer was released from the Arizona hospital after being treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Andalusian Federation be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and United Left MEP, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to assume responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the procedure the party must have against the one who has so far been sitting as city councillor in the Seville Municipal Council.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the necessity of 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the breaches of the rules that Silva might have started: 'The VL always insisted that such cases should be given maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that the formation of 'a strict ethical code for all public offices' has.
`Sangre de mayo': Herobook of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmmaking, with around 15 million euros of investment for filming.
In this way, the cinematographer has tried to depict 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired at the works of the famous novelist, said Carci today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of actors.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented this Friday in cinemas and later on on the telemadrid station as a four hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdó's literature, assures that thanks to this film his 'childhood dream' came true. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to film a memorial film for the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2. Especially because history is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million made for shooting by the autonomous community of Madrid, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'disturbed Spain', which chose the false leader for the struggle, because the people had been left behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.'
However, the cinematographer regrets the fact that one could not expect funding like that of `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as at `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenplay with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of film in 'Volver a empezar', contributed by his usual way of working: he appeared on stage to the actors with whom one first had to try before starting to shoot and to those who had not done casting he appeared 'demeaning' and respectful, 'part of the film director's profession is to provide help in theatre and cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which one works.'
Many actors he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar's candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo' nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' nor finally the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
`In the beginning you think you're working for the offspring, later you realize that it's only for the better, and now you're satisfied if you've produced another movie', explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalane (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and, when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters to emancipate women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and stood for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested to me this role, which seemed impossible to me.'
'We're not trying to tell about her life without keeping her Esprit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I have been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The production is based on two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerto aberta'; and with flamenco champion Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The production also includes musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Jjarez, he takes on the role of companion of the artists who were Divas, in whom he repeatedly fell in love.'
This work also tells a certain way of telling about the life of this woman, who has been known in as far places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has normally lived in London.
`I wanted to call them back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a particular era and whose works are no longer appreciated today, and therefore she knows even less', says Bayón.
The performance takes place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which opened in May and, after which it was in different places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented in the course of the international congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The U.S. can imagine itself badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'sensation reporter', and from the then dominant notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic imagination and followed her.
Now, see what it cost him to give the Oscar.
And when he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford crying, `my life and my country were the greatest horrors of his life.'
No one was afraid to make himself ridiculous or to exaggerate.
As the 'father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, in which the self-esteem of the Americans in the hopeless search for reasons to hold back dignity is.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people can be admired, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as well as various losses: from the foundation that has dedicated itself to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage that died of overdose to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it took a great deal of effort for it to impose itself against a deadly food culture.
A wide wave of amazement strikes haushoch over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the entire era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the greatest of us all,' said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today trust to live as Paul Newman lived: having high demands on justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?', he joked often himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
'Of all the great roles that he played, to none was he as proud as of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and those of the Philanthropist,' they say.
The streets in Madrid are defective for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called the perfect street, and in my opinion, she was the worst street with everything there and there.
Of course, it's a lot of nonsense if you take note of the evaluation and I could check it out, that would clearly not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you do it, then they should give you everything (including chip, to avoid the congestion on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of just going there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
So, well, things like these are a trifle compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a waiting line of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be more difficult to get them back.
In addition, in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain it looked like a temptation to organize a popular uprising and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time for this chip I have received, I can already think that the output was misprinted.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect street, this road would never come to mind.
So I think we're going to dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an entity of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move on to the company's campus).The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this receptionist can see how many people in the room are who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also assign those present after the discussions to the groups.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads to her conversation, and that neither is a company employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week they talked very superficially about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial trash, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is only a finding when you consider that Microsoft added some feature and `Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses meaning, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, that was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skilled many point out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the environment of the 'windows'.
What are half of the applications available in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 has to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, less excessive, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without a doubt. I bring a small example of that.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the refreshing beverage machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees of Microsoft, Google, used the net for research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to simultaneously bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless star performances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a pointed beard that had raised heavy weight in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the name creation is associated with sport and stems from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and distinguishes itself by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that have these T-shirts as detail on the neckline.
And notice, the Belgian company is not just focusing on the production of 'tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton pants, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modelled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
'I will be a young mother; I will not worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is lovely, but full of joy of life.
At present, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, that means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango, moved there her residence and also made the presentation of the most important prizes in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this fall/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, as well as visiting the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and taking part in dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish House, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and watch women dressed as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything meets in one place and these areas have many in common.
Ever since I was a kid, I was thrilled with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to roll around my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in classes and at rehearsals to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You just turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, shit.
I feel better than ever when I'm 30 years old.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am a mother because that requires my body and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
I will convey great happiness to my child and raise it with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep in mind the works you took part in and were shot last year.
That is the way it is, and I would like it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theater, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A few days ago, you were on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to attend a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two items of clothing from our collection were auctioned for Mango to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
The people don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things being told about them, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not voting.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do the same.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can fall back because of the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunken state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the General Public Prosecutor's Report. It is a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialise the driver, which is why he receives a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
The Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate in this, except for the Public Prosecutor General's Office, as experience shows.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol were taxed.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents auto start when the driver has done the alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected which is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices prevented up to 65% of the regulatory violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time planned by the program, in addition to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force landed with the prince and princess of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their rays were still forced to use the hand as a parachute to see the royal pair that came out of the plane.
Directly at the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the street whether he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people with you at the airport at this time. You're from here or so.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and the Princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give off the Medal of Honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-weaved hair, without ordinary 'peep-toes', may have been told that a thunderstorm in DF is expected.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in which the official follow-up awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, awaits a reporter from Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there probably was no significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Awards' to promote and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the first Belgian winner, saw her drawings yesterday in the Mango Branch store window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest store is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain because his brother died recently, broke up. He put on the suit from the fashion house and wore some jewelry from ELAH that were breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango's house, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended up with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, because Jacketts they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the shop and had a trousers and shirt on which she herself modelled, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a room for ballet samples, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a rod and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she showed us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always evokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed sheets and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Response to stress
There is not a 1000, but one more way to forget the chaotic life of our everyday lives.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book that says how to relax. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning, but even worse the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm that demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of switching off the working world.
But the number is increasing, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the full list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the tranquility which the book conveys comes into the bookshops of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who believes that it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be alarmed, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially for children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often relationships with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedding noses at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we have mentioned earlier, it can be very high fiber, stress situations or overexposure.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It can be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite the opposite (scream, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and is thus caused.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnoea or stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Try not to upset the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are terrible and too wild.
For the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
It helps the child sleep quietly.
If the talk occurs in the sleep once, try to keep the peace.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Helpful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if a couple of apparitions are scary, it is recommended to be advised or to find out what reason the child is afraid of.
If they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on them to conduct a hearing and to obtain more information.
Thus you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams of and why it says that they are careful to interpret the information and the conclusions it draws from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It's causing a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Houses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäusern is finally on the field again on a success course.
Without great effort, the yellow-blacks played numerous torch opportunities and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance passed just past the corner, Illhäuser should easily dominate the game, and alternately Fonderflick only managed to challenge the defense of Denmark with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with a foothead.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only passed through the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two torquences fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhäuser through Marais, which stood exactly right to assume a ball that had been defended in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-housed goalie should not be able to enjoy his luck long and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which means that his teammates had to play on pay.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not encounter any major problems with an ill-haustic eleven, who only withdrew a little to 'enhance their defense', except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
In view of the determined attitude of fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet on Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in Finistère to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit', and hope that he will come with 'concrete suggestions'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, established by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in view of the extreme increase in the price of diesel, which has reached an average record of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesperson of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their business become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of seafarers.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning they led the protest march in Morbihan and Calvado, which caused traffic of almost ten kilometers in length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish herds did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of the merchant ships.
The fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those responsible for the national fisheries committee who did not support their movement.
'The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not yield at all' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the litre about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes were adopted by the cinematic and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threat of recession, as a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, is considering giving up more than 15% of its assets, in order to repay the 85 billion dollars that were set aside for it.
AIG is willing to direct the sale of a large part of its business, beyond its life insurance at international level and its retirement provisions in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
There was no confirmation of the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might separate from, are its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
As regards these sales, no final decision was taken, FT continues.
As a matter of urgency, AIG must make sales in order to repay the loans of over 85 billion, which it has granted to the Federal Reserve, also at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of courses: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nadag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777,68 points to 10,365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final takeoff figures, the Nasdag index, mainly concerning technology, dropped by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was supposed to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been beaten down at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes in favour and 205 against, the honourable Members refused the funds he had asked for by the Secretary of Finance, Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here a bad picture is circulated, which represents the Congress as unable to accept a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
'This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will be too late.
`If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, Note Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions', warned Brian Bethune, Economic Manager at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, highlighting even more the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that passes away brings the ruin of a financial corporation in the United States'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank operations of Wachovia from its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis hastened suddenly, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing not only an American but a global crisis, added the FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic goods has grown sharply.
Within ten years, revenue from the State Treasury fell from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenues within 30 years of last night ranged from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points on the first television duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another one to find out who won it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show, which was to be followed by a third of the American families, for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite considerable, was not 'brilliant' enough to enable him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, which says Obama has five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that democracy is clearly making the better figure.
For the still undecided voters, that is, those who are now the target, Obama emerged from the polls with 39% as the winner, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy at the forefront, and clearly stressing the 'naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television broadcast.
'Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
`I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president', he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He made a brief and precise statement without being taken out of the version.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, Obama has already', this weekend opposed a democratic election campaign in which Republicans were accused of not having grasped the full extent of the crisis that is on the 'American road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama denounced 20,000 people yesterday who had gathered in streaming rain on the occasion of an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday by the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After once again stressing that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, were his top priority.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates thoughtfully deviate from the questions raised in the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Young people and oppositionists demonstrated Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closing of the polling facilities in Minsk's marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even choose: 'What's the point if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself in the best light to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-delivery of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the raising of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed to be clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting," lamented Juri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition move into Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition therefore owes itself to getting involved in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasises that the electoral turnout figures appear too high and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August of this year.
Nobody was in the polls.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, those who are closest to the government's ideas.
The silence of the night descends again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulated on their success.
Discussion - From Blood That Has Been Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained public confidence, which was badly shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, during the 1980s the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross had contaminated national blood reserves with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and public dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada launched in February 1994 a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances which had led to such tragedy, and at drawing up guidelines to prevent a further catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to report, several provinces set up a committee at that time, whose aim was to develop a new system for the administration of blood canning in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, who is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec began her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood-supplied system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canning and by working in this field during the following years, we have regained public confidence', she says, before she proudly emphasizes that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that 'trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted on the principle of caution.
At this time we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been in charge since its founding in 1998.
`And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease only progresses slowly, as it is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from individuals who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago there was no doubt that this disease was being transmitted through the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we used has quite a meaning.
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: the Nucleic Acid Tests (NST), which enable the donor to directly detect the presence of the virus itself in the donor’s blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests previously used.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, 12 million blood canned foods would have to be distributed before someone was infected with HIV.
As Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood canned products each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted through a blood canned product.
I think you can feel comfortable these days when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore your health,' says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Only last year did the Chikungunya virus appear on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We have to monitor continuously', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supply in addition to a secure supply.
'The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has an impact on the blood supply network, of which only 3% of Quebec's blood donation population is on average.'
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and who meets the fitness criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who make their blood available are not expected to be ill with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
With this 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and to get them to become regular donors.
Life today is so hectic that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in blood donation,' regrets Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood canned but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively in case of serious burns.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains rich blood stem cells that can help treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the insertion of our thousands of umbilical cord blood samples, and we are planning to decrease more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start by making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary further explains, which describes this program of navel cord loss as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it', because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in semi-finals
Montreal's impact, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all goals), against the Seattle Sounders in the second round, has qualified for the semi-finals of the U.S.L.'s first league in the semi-finals, and the Saputo-Stadion quarter-finals, in which the overall door ratio was counted.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a gate for both the one and for the other, the midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday impact, Starfire Complex in Tukila in a suburb Seattle had brought in a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-final, impact will be measured with the whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota with a 4 to 3 win, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-finals with a total door ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn launched the attack on the Panthers from Florida with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only goal of all the shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, warned the Russians.
I need another game to make me feel better.'
`He's been too fixated on it in the first half,' said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest sets to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the opening of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tries to be elected in today's partial election.
'Move the course of our last big border to the north': This is the long-term goal presented by Jean Charest yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Quebec Liberal Party in Levi, following the guidelines.
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular images of hydroelectric plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds like during the election period.
In contrast to the press, the Prime Minister refused to rule out the fact that he would hold the elections this fall, even if he had been told that his schedule was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' alleged by the Prime Minister for Quebec, namely the 'new economic area' which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned recently in the speeches of the Prime Minister, the opening of the north - the northern part of the 49th parallel - has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was 'a jewel with enormous potential', but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
At most a few perspectives on what could be done more: above all on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest's census, the north has 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `Area twice as big as France` is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is in us', he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added, after he had made a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, said to the prime minister of the press.
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments followed.
There is a borderline on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he said.
Moreover, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision from the north', he explained and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be navigable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pekistist MP of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A Ministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Land Treasures) takes an important place, has begun the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity for 'a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan North will be discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal prime minister who was in front of him.
Like the liberals who were in front of us in office, we have thought about transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
By the way, this was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout dam.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew to determine the future', declared Jean Charest.
On the other hand, he referred to another conservative project, namely the `Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the hydroelectric dam Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I intend to be there,' he entrusted to his party members what caused those storms of applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly also in 2009, has in fact the possibility of holding a elections this fall, which is possible to him from the law, not yet excluded.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, especially because of a mission by the Council of the European Communities in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The Weekend General Assembly provided the Liberal Party Head with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'the constitutional objectives', which were accepted without further delay: the PLQ specifically calls for recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto regarding decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to you, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to apply it.
If she had done so, we would have done much more today, Mrs. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the adoption of a North plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this will not only be a great idea,' said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letters - A Destructed Country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in the cabinet of Harper was the one who allowed herself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'pity' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government which, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home its fellow countryman in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things happened that are being accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and allows a child soldier to be killed under inhumane conditions.
The only one who goes down to a court case to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the association of Canadian lawyers in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
This particular government also closes its eyes to the torture: it is little to her that after so many years of torment a young adult will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a frantic circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries before him like a flag, and that sounds so unspeakable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily mistreat, torture and lock up a Canadian citizen, according to the thoughts of a head of government, who is still supported only by the minority (may he be a minority after the 14th of October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellic Speech of Barrick Gold
In her September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an orwell logic, that the world's largest gold-mining society sought to open up a slanderous charge of over six million against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander complaints, but on the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, driving everyone into the ruin that dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process starts, the authors and editors of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactic of these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defenders, in order to force a mutually agreeable regime that will muzzle the opposite side and also deter anyone who dares to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not through the bulwark.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed their books and files and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent testing teams that could have brought light to this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and erases the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement aside.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how, at the same time, he can ask for a 'public' debate and, at the same time, ignore the opinions of this public?
It seems that in the world of the Vice-President, this word covers only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a rather narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, slanderers themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she asks them not to use this term anymore...).
Apart from Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom of academic research and the discovery of truth, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment that we belong to has long known to address debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, unlike what she says, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit these types of unjustified complaints.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The Bush administration and the leading congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion, which is to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months, is still to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main elements are: better monitoring of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new arrangements to limit the number of houses pledged as a result of arrears of payments, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
American Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representatives present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
'We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective', said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
`Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street', the democrat said.
`This is the fundamental point: If we don't, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous,' said the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a further failure on the investors’ mood would have had.
The deadline agreed was market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations only recently, proved to be in favour of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction at the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
The Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain provisions to the agreement, in particular those which should enable the owners to keep their homes, and those which relate to the salaries of the senior employees of the companies saved by the State.
'If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibleness of certain persons, that is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary', he said on American television.
When he was asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The principles that I have read [show] that this is one thing we all need to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at making taxpayers' money
He comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the placement of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprime) before extending to further forms of widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to the freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican Members who failed the first attempt to reach agreement last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies should only be secured by the government and should not be bought, it is believed that the dead end escapes.
To round off the perspective for all in Congress, one has also added an order that, if the government were to make losses with this program within five years, they could then raise new taxes to hold back their invested capital.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring them dividends in the case of winnings and that can resell it once the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of suspending the settlement procedures relating to the dwellings linked to the real estate loans covered by this plan and also setting deadlines for the repayment and settlements paid to the senior employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given green light.
In fact, there were further votes yesterday against this project, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'Clearly Washington doesn't understand us', said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Board's Financial Commission, his constituents.
'Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are asking taxpayers to check out.'
The Democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called 'the Caucasian of Sceptics', is different, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent business professors, including three Nobel Laureates, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and to carefully consider which way to go', he said yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe again found proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying its competitor, who is in great difficulty, since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos explained.
To compensate, we receive an electoral right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.'
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was just about to put another bank in trouble by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the UK bank.
According to Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government has had to govern since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was for a long time his trumpet, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to the world.
But what a long-lasting runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more carefully in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blast of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
One of the famous faces of the American dream should emerge from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the Self-Made-man was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then went to the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon also in cinema.
Even this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver, who became second in 1979 at the 24 hour race of Mans in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, too, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, committed and hypersensitive star to the glamour of the show business will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death put cinema lovers in twilight this weekend, while all his big roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change moves with him.
Then again, the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) pushes back to memory, and the young man who returns his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to Die Katze on the hot sheet roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It is a much shorter-backed memory (1990) that wakes up to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Someone Up There Likes Me (a hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was meant for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman well known in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his resume, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his prestige and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the underplaying when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The Metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles for a long time just flew.
However, he played rarer Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotic, alcoholic, coward or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his sleigh and reluctance.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown aspects of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott through an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of fineness and sadness.
In the flood of honours that took place yesterday about Newman, his close friend Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained: `His present has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood's abduction, is now going there.
We have often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, sauces, pastries or other foods, and this seemed rather tasteless, even though at first we found it funny.
The profits from his sales were still in his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.'
And for us it was an honor to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and widest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Supplement & Co.?
On 8 October negotiations began in the criminal proceedings against János's award and his accomplices.
In particular, the accused is charged with involvement in organised crime, gross negligence and commercial fraud, and other criminal offences, including document fraud.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the funds lurked in the invitations to tender were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often charged with false invoices.
State funds and subsidies from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are to be partly transferred to the funds of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the private funds of individuals.
As the investigation authorities have announced, fictitious invoices have been submitted in respect of the tender funds, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the prosecution, a large part of the bills should have been falsified.
The billing blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seal was made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was taken on that tour north of Lake Platten, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find out about pensions and restaurants.
He asked for bills on consumption in order to be able to issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest later on these submissions.
These bills should have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András ʿri, the latter being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports according to our information.
One of Lados' "Examining Tour"'s goals was a beer room.
As can be seen from two invoices issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is said to have hosted the 90-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the manager of the farm states that such a large group would not have been able to enter the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters had apparently no limits, just as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company, in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not first appear according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas informed hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was a falsified document when documents were presented to him by the Public Prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were wrong on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact that the farm should have accommodated one hundred people after having 11 rooms in total, which are impossible to accommodate.
It was also mentioned on the bill for catering, where the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The eminent counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they visited offers travel abroad only, and so they have indicated Hungary's travels on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
In addition, as has been known in the course of the investigations, they also pointed to the invoices, although travel agency services, which relate to a country outside the EU, are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totally wrong at four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfüllöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company was charged only 15 percent VAT instead of 25 percent, and the employees only issued machine invoices, but the falsified documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounting companies" was that in one case they had declared "good transport" as performance, although this is not offered by the company specialized in investment consulting, the prosecutor announced.
Further formal errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont, could be revealed as forgeries.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors had the right to never issue the invoices.
Another "error" is the forgery of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This society was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore indicated that the invoices did not have been issued himself.
Consciously forged
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the prosecution, the CEO of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional invoices.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, is said to have cooperated with Supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is expected to provide the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület associations with fake invoices worth HUF 5 million, which relate to non-performance.
However, there was also little payment since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, which the persons concerned forgot to mention in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest.
This company is expected to have issued several invoices on the sale of IT components in the period from October to December 2005 in the total value of HUF about 18 million.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have been the buyer of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to which the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been able to issue invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the clubs Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian masons on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which was, according to the defendant, due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he could benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the supplement, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Overall, Kubatov is expected to have issued 15 invoices worth HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The Public Prosecutor's Office assumes that Cubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice sum as well as VAT.
Kubatov is said to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issue of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were submitted to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but benefited from these amounts for non-profit purposes.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictional invoices from the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused persons are now expected to make a confession about the way in which the invoice was falsified, as it was already filed before the prosecutor's office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decided to make a comprehensive confession.
Indeed, his previous information was less detailed and, although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him with regard to the reparation of the bulk of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge is in return ready to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that a strike now plays the "injured" after his attempts to alleviate imprisonment and house arrest had been met on deaf ears.
While other criminals, who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid them, are at liberty, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains to be refused.
The psychology of oversupply - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overestimate the error bid.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to compete in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even higher prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others took part in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brainbone, was measured at the loss of the auction, in which the enemy’s oversupply plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore considered that the price increase was explained by the avoidance of an overreaction to the striatum.
In order to substantiate their thesis, the economists in the research group have carried out additional research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised 15 dollar reward, in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the event of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on the one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
However, as evidence of the hypotheses expressed by neurologists, the members of the "opposite to lose" group were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results can not be derived from previous economic theory.
In fact, they have only been able to justify the behaviour observed at auctions with the pleasure of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaging neurological processes, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should the doctor visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of people infected is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for various viruses that cause infectious liver disease.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and the diseases differ.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated foods or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, cleavage secretion or saliva).
Travellers are advised to receive vaccination against the viruses A and B at least, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear approximately two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and vomiting.
After that, yellow fever occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B-induced, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer without treatment.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, as the pathogen is hesitantly destroying the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular monitoring, is therefore essential.
There are three groups where this disease is more common: those who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
In good time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, which bans the risk of infection and prevents the development of cancer.
September 30 is the World Day of Hepatitis, which is held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious faith acts as a sort of "painful" that should have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been investigated to what extent belief in God affects the pain of man, reported the British newspaper "Telegraph".
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting by the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which scientists also participate philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was connected to the left hand, which the electric shocks gave off.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and, on the other, Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would produce a kind of religious trance, while they chose da Vinci's image, because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while they should either look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt "in security" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "careful", and they felt "peace and quiet".
While viewing the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo's work in mind.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other, highly effective images also among the atheists, one would just have to find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that gives rise to very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing faith should change our personality, and in many cases, too," says Wright.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains of what effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling me about yourself.
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can claim with moisture and justice: it is in people's pockets just as it is about their heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And that still isn't enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of sceptics who are being plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he has them directed: These would just ignore the essence of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to get closer to the company's original goal, according to which they want to "order all information of this world".
Schmidt stated that after ten years of changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs are not yet able to answer because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and later to use it so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and based on the same logic, the so-called "Recommendations" recommending custom-made products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a misuse of data - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which causes fear, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or the reluctance to reject the power that many Internet users have.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an incident, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of this was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, in which Google provided information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, users concerned with personal rights were still able to breathe in May when Google, together with the civil rights organisation EFF, successfully brought against the FBI in court: hence, Google cannot be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request at any point in the Constitution in future.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully achieved the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list, has been withheld back to two months.)
So Google's image remains controversial: Those who refuse to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google's services, the company is scolding with the outrage that is due to conservative companies.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and is enthusiastic about computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes and provides its services for free, so that an open, constantly updated source code and software package seem far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, a relationship that has been brought to the centre in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, that is, the users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individual, the main thing remains to be shown publicly.
An average youth can manage its profile at the same time on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, it can connect with other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are located on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove this: when looking at the party photos of the last night, the friend will soon find out with whom her infidel friend has enjoyed himself, or the employee will be released because in his blog he only makes too honest his anger about the company management air - one thing is certain: the term "private sphere" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives of himself - so in some cases one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google Monopol, can do that - like with Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google's search engine, does not deliberately leave any traces.
Not a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not inventable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile of the user.
However, public opinion waits for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising space threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly quickly introduced services not only cause Microsoft but also other software developers to break their heads.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the Group management rejected a protest of employees completely after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the multitime catering of employees is too expensive. However, this is a mild sign that Google even went to the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all regime-critical hits, or those that violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal rules are that no new service will be applied for in advance, but only when it is available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could change a lot: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project is now assuming that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are concerned about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already gives the next generation of Sci-Fi authors the fabric - for example, "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly close thanks to Google's data.
Two young people are helping the double killer of Ózd to remove traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of being involved in the elimination of traces, the spokesman of the police commissioner Borsod announced on Tuesday.
The young people were steadfast and are currently being charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, these are two girls who defend themselves on a free footing.
Aid is under threat of imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under grave suspicion of having deliberately murdered several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect, however, did not want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor into an area in Ózd, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a gun hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapons of action and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Places Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech krona, offered the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange's stock packages.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
Following reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer made by Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, Head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and he also did not rule out that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with 25 percent stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-increasing international financial crisis, a number of leading European newspapers spoke on Tuesday of "second September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American President, said, for example, "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to put his own party behind him for the draft law, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to talk about a "second September 11th".
Parts of the press in Madrid also located the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can't ignore the threat any more, for example, the Geneva "Day Advertiser".
While some countries could still provide rescue packages to their debilitated financial institutions, banks could save taxpayers’ money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks fail, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to money institutions that are dwindling, the Viennese "The Standard". Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now also have to grab a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is now sweeping like a tsunami over the old continents.
While the "setters" would not immediately have to "widdle" with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to maintain in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired in the creation of new accident prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic system of type BR23C, a mini-car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield," said Kazuhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The compound eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To simulate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a field of vision of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of seconds, and the autobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place instinctively.
"If it wasn't, the Autobot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Autoboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology is the most internal and vulnerable part of the shield - a layer that is currently considered unavoidable within the accidents.
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of bees when avoiding other bees.
And this must end in a fraction of a second.
However, unlike the bees, the deviation can not be made up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use the autobot only the rotational movement, or acceleration and braking.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life span than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react accordingly to them.
It does not have to store it, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous maneuvers, so that it constantly only takes a handful of KB Memory.
There is no need for gigabytes and megabytes of heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production in the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the goal.
A name for the sinister child
Now there is the written version of the 700-billion-dollar rescue package law, which will apply in several stages and aims at purchasing the bad loans of the banks.
In the first pass half of the money is to be spent.
Reuters reported in a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight on the East Coast local time, after several days of debate, the congress members reached an agreement on the 700-billion-dollar heavy rescue package.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the American House of Representatives, and said that the agreement should only be put to the table.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson concluded: the programme will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done. According to Pelosi, this was not about saving Wall Street, but about tearing the business around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, so, Washington time Sunday evening 8:00 (Central European time Monday 2:00 a.m.), but did not trigger an altitude flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft law to stabilise the economy of 2008, and the Senate will be on its way.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be spent on the purchase of lazy securities charged with loans.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion will be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the Congress will vote on the Causa as expected on Monday. This sum will be spent on the purchase of credit-laden, bad securities, and the President will decide on the next USD 100 billion.
The programme is being reviewed by a Commission of its own, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on a further decision by Congress.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by competent persons of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the funds of concern and the companies pay the expected fees.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the bosses of the banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect their redundancies, called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake, to be shortened by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The reduction essentially means that when the ministry buys in an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the retired bank manager is transferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of lazy loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that the management salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions relate only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented Democratic Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee.
The State gains the right to participate in participating banks, so that the risk to taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank gets better.
The draft law provides for the President to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers' money at all, says the Californian Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were promoted by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, domestic sales prices rose by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, and compared to August 2007, by 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, and fell by 3.9 per cent compared to previous year's prices.
Due to price changes in the domestic and export sectors, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices increased only slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
Sales prices of the manufacturing industry also increased only a little - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - mainly for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, for shoes the prices went up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices of plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased the prices of chemicals and productions (1.6 percent).
A price decrease was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices in paper production, publishing and printing remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly as a result of the increase in gas prices introduced on 1 July.
If one looks at the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in the year-on-year, the prices of crude oil processing have increased most (32.4 percent).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2-percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A price drop was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The cost in the other manufacturing industries ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
On the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the investment goods sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while they remained the same in the energy and further processing sector compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the 2007 comparative period (16.8%).
In sectors producing consumer goods, a price increase of 6.8 per cent was observed, with investment goods falling by 1.4 per cent.
The export prices of the industry measured in Forint rose by 1.1 per cent in August compared with the previous month, but in comparison there was a decrease of 3.9 per cent.
The domestic currency was 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, the dollar was 7.1 percent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 rate, it was 7.5 percent stronger compared to the euro, the dollar even 15.9 percent stronger.
No more visas to the USA from 2009 onwards?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force on 12 January, as the foreign minister told the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their view is that "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system in overseas is being introduced in good time."
She also stressed, however, that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but that the tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" to the Republic of Hungary, and also has talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, agreed on Sunday to support the 700 billion dollar rescue package for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government representatives announced on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package after days of marathon advice.
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain's Hoch, who gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At an election campaign in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the law on the 700 billion dollar package.
He stressed that the plan also included those passages of consumer protection that he supported with.
"We must now act responsibly (...) - your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 spectators.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic vision "obsolet".
In an interview given to the transmitter ABC, McCain said: "We will all have a hard time piercing (...) but nothing is definitely no alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also presupposes the setting up of a Control Commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the handling of top managers - something that he insisted on.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so comments "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution annihilates their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian-Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breakup of the epoch is also a problem of Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, took place almost ten years ago: the dubious hegemony of a state party
For already ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty percent mark
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so still in the much quoted Stoiber era.
The modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already forecast this 40 years ago, but at the same time greatly appreciated it at the same time. However, without impact, secularization, educational success, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the fidelity of the CSU electors.
Modernisation always goes hand in hand with an increase in options, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willing.
It is striking that in the last few weeks the classic citizen groups have said the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with a degree as a university degree.
Here, CSU's support dropped to even less than 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in her "Who with whom? Party leaders withholding in coalition questions" titled article on the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the incorporation of the SPÖ into internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to discussions in all directions, while the Greens do not want to decide on a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party leaders hardly looked at their cards.
SPÖ-Chief Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Mellerer course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, however, has responded cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere with the ÖVP's internal concerns.
Whether his party is in opposition, or is going into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ-Chief Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The Devil’s Circle of Poverty and Segregation Must Be Break Through
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities, which is being held this year by the EU Presidency of the Council of France, has begun.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, a member of the European People's Party's Party's Fidesz, drew attention to education segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of law that affects Roma children, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Mr Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, and the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the Press Office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka has pointed out that apart from discrimination in job search, Roma would be excluded from the labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no secondary education, and due to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right which would have a key role to play in asserting other human rights.
Investment in the early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
In the view of the honourable Members, it is important that these links become as broad a circle as possible - Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and turnover taxes they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated education must be discontinued" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the honourable Member said, a joint, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to speed up the process of deregulation in the education sector, which is essential if the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are to be properly complied with.
"We must break through the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advance of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also at national level, within the meaning of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the electoral debacle, no heads are rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of voice is decided at the extraordinary party meeting on the last week of October.
The much-trained duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to soften the angry group and the party base, which one day after the "Baryerian Tsunami" demanded personal consequences in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career highlight - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a single director in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the inter-party restructurings, the potential successor to Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the exploration team, which will conduct exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition with the liberal FDP, or the "Free Voters" right-wing.
An irony of fate is similar to the fact that with the list "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stober appearances the Huber-Beckstein Duo first used to serve the determined politician mercilessly.
The CSU leadership is now concentrating all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role.
On Monday, Huber made some toxic comments towards the CDU - in his opinion, the CSU had earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed a lot to success at national level in 2005, is not put back on track with a joint force action, Merkel cannot become a chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who, out of her disappointment at the fiasco, did not make any noise, believes that the loss of the terrain of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament managed to do so.
Russian observers believe that this is due to the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects that there are illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The ten-million-dollar country legislatur comes without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, before yesterday’s elections, the opposing party under the name “United Democratic Forces” (ODS) has seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who was already renewing his presidential mandate for the fourth time during the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "let" some opposition members in Parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even removed the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly dependent on the economy thanks to the rising prices of natural gas imports from Russia. In order to alleviate the price increases, even loans were received, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country-leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. In the light of the opposition’s expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other senior politicians had been banned because of the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which emphasis was more on the positive movements than on the defects - such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided for temporary relaxation.
However, on Monday, the OECD's rapid report criticised the campaign - which is why opposition officials are unlikely to be in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition was able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were set free, for instance, and Minsk is even prepared to face smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is a federal state on paper, considered the two territories independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkevich to our magazine.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful are afraid to leave only one oppositionary to Parliament."
The opposition does not intend to take any protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have many problems to deal with here - the oppositional newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the older ones" - Milinkevich said, alleging that not even the most-supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" which is admonished to the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of Mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe the deeds, and not the words."The lack of opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are rotating doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
As of today, the measure will come into force against those sluices who first stamp and then go to drink coffee during working hours.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Driving doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," says Brunetta once again.
With the Palazzo Chigi the installation ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of the turnable doors is also of great symbolic value".
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises on this with a smile: "A good cappuccino works wonders at 7 a.m.".
During a meeting of the General Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministazione)
by Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absences of officials have reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 people per year are more present at work".
He added that it was necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as large as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of officials have joined forces to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiled himself with figures about lower delays in work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of the 'active lunatic' grow continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants of the public service have joined forces to explain the illegal standards of the district to the war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, and the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspections can be carried out and further aspects of the Minister's renewals are being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of accidents at work is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2500 accidents at work, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For 2007, the data of Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy is going to attend the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to job prevention, to the protection of injured workers, to support the families of the victims and to raise awareness of public opinion".
"An outrageous "Basta" has risen to this point; understandably in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their size, trigger some vortex in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
A special importance is attached to the numerous initiatives for a more direct raising of awareness in schools by young people who feed on the labour market.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. One must put into force and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths represents an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all of our institutions to work towards firm rules that aim to put an end to the problem".
"The data from the accidents at work seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of accidents at work is too high," said President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents, and you can fight it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate workers who are already starting school".
"An additional effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in need of a phenomenon which is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also pointed out "the progressive deterioration in the protection of victims of accidents at work" and urged "the abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not depend on voluntary or accidental donations that are decided upon by a legislator from time to time".
Mp3 Player under Charge: Hazard of Hearing Damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which in a report published today in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"From the report – it is said in a note – it becomes clear that 5-10% of those who hear music louder than one hour a day with portable music for at least five years risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume, are irrevocably damaging their hearing without knowing it," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – that is, from the European Union – there is a clear risk of rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumer awareness and make this information a common asset.
In the light of these scientific findings, we need to re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology".
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical instruments among young people.
"Scientists - this concludes the EU communication - confirm that there is a proper concern and that the European Commission, together with the other members of the European Union and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise, from portable music devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment which limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could result from excessive noise exposure.
One can limit these damage very much in terms of solutions such as the reduction of volume and the length of noise exposure.
In her report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices only heard five hours a week of music (only than 89 decibels) so that the legal boundaries were already exceeded, the maximum noise level at the workplace applies.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This represents 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June we're getting a balance sheet.
This is the procedure laid down by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
As soon as the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," says Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains with the City and Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a great project for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a time-limited end point.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who questions the Commission's competence, as their opinion on liability is lacking, responds to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, policies deal with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look at a longer period of time so that we can work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city".
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarify the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to mind. It will occupy the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to make a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, who "will not only be confined to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is an explanation
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the economy of the United States through his decisions, and who maintained relations with the existing Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote in an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a great lead.
Even in this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the polling booth will we know who will give his voice to the real American patriot.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we will decide who we will make our crutches for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weak point.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse leaves its mark on journalists too: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control regarding the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express their concern about the general credibility of the information concerning those responsible.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed for these journalists.
In addition, the major problems are caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the paper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at national level.
In the local area, the Executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes.
The main publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping to "bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rift is in American journalism today between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of chief editors at national level are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", Note d. Red.) is always a topical issue in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers like it are popular and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes get only 10,000 euros per month, as well as pension and insurance money.
As far as holiday is concerned, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, in order to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, will often "disease" during the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROMAN JUDGMENT: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Chamber of Penalty of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the anti-dumping investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (against which the public prosecutor had pronounced) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to get to him accusing evidence.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion dollar savings package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday's issue of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis has progressed beyond the Republican Party, which is becoming more and more divided into its old and moderate East Coast Seele, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "the Washington" and the financial world and, above all, win voters in the south and the centre of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise, above all, to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond, will be affected by these.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-afraid events, which, under these new conditions, finally take shape and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of banking and financial institutions, which have close links with abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of private households living in a single state.
This is an immediate political problem for governments: how to deal with the families concerned, which is an enormous mass of voters.
The crisis therefore appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone awry in itself and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, because of its division into various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, above all, distribution of aid funds: ever since the crisis became more serious, only the US is in the economic situation to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus two non-exhaustive conditions – under certain circumstances – on which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to rely in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that is most recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is right now, when we were so convinced of having long ago entered a networked empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the intangible, that we need to determine at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still extremely connected to a closely defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a cropless, waterless or oil - free area.
I now come to the second innovation, which, however, requires a short shift.
Those who say territory, who government, who politics, thus also say leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, so the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of dismay over the existing leaders, especially those of the economy, who have emerged as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an impatience, an image of inefficiency, a feeling of distance, all directed towards an entire class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population paves the way for it to be not only the deeds of social elites, but already their world of ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority as ever more alien and superior.
The demand for leadership thus nourishes underground a forced but powerful movement of the abduction of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the immediate reversal of the collective state of mind of the past: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party in the UK, the rebellion of the American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value of what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is still being strengthened from the financial crisis and driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The supersticker that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached the target almost.
With a glue placed on an area of only 2.5 sqcm, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
STUDIO – an American magazine, has published the results of the researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of a stack of spaghetti arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of Geckos, which are covered by microscopic herbs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass teflon and sand paper have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "removes easily from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
TO MOUNTAINS ENDURANCE? "This material could be used as a transitory adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers think of less fascinating benefits, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the space sector.
So for the moment, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleanses itself of the dust by movement on a surface, keeping perfect liability.
Medicines: never take fruit juice
Be careful with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme effect on their absorption by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaging as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. At the 236th American Chemical Society meeting in Philadelphia, he again called for an alarm: a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, so that they are practically eliminated and the health of the patients is endangered.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected of being responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, cardiovasculars, anxiolytics and neurologics, up to toxic levels.
MEDICALS IN DRIVER – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago about the dangers of this mixture, and stressed that what is being drunk in conjunction with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
IT IS NOT GRAFFRUIT – According to the experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
The appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "These results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, do not hesitate to ask a pharmacist or a doctor," the Ansa-agent expert stresses.
Business Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and external policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the Enron days of the collapse, Krugman had claimed in an editorial of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the assassinations.
A prediction that received not little polemics as an answer and was presented to the economist years later but proved to be quite right today.
"I am surprised and also shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public domain," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economist of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source software is gaining an ever larger number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the public with some new features: in addition to a revised and now sparsely designed start menu, a basic compatibility with Apple's Mac OS x operating system is finally achieved, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
In addition, attention has been paid to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which facilitates e.g. sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules while at the same time preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can now also generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: Tables can now be edited by different users more easily, avoiding conflicts with changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a question to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are just about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice the big throw could succeed: after all, various public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is no lack of even a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as PowerPoint; Dbase to operate databases instead of known access; and last but not least Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded at already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also cabbage tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up with the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, the third-classified winner and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the third generation Epo. Previously, this was already encountered by the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli as well as by the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the countersamples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epothesis, and, according to the Associated Press, he also informed the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME AMENDMENT: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only accepted with opposition.
Does this come from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the subject of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times refer to as "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cite further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not only this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the Lega and the swifter expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also underlines the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting on the Quirinal to cooperate between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students knows no crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious moves. A whole host of students are losing their right to study in such a way, as their families are unable to support them at this level" – according to Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market that has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of breaches: free contracts, missing registrations, without rental price limit, unauthorized subletting.
For the Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which result from a revision of the tax at lower rental prices.
In a closer look at the study, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping area is needed in the Brianza district about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Nere band) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the districts around the university, are 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the districts around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping area in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the districts around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those who choose outside areas can save money: 300 Euros for a sleeping area and 450 Euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you will need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average, is demanded by foreign students.
Good-bye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of large multi-story complexes in the periphery, means death in the long term for the single-room cinema in the centre. A process that appears not only irrevocably and irrevocably, but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
These are mostly historical places full of memories, "It is like losing a friend with whom one has travelled a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great prize of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas had to close; these coins paid mostly the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years Lombardy has led the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all the receipt of the already existing one, because closing a hall in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit instead of the old one a multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here remains the missing bill for the fund of the trade union outside the eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
To preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year".
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, because of the fears about the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it by means of an agreement between the community and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, which aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The measures envisaged include tax incentives for cinema operators and benefits for the public in terms of local transport: it will be possible to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the centre and also park at more favourable parking fees.
"It is a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But certainly we also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex rooms, because finally the audience of today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have been living in Rome; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side in order not to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations by the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in Mafia business, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been convicted for entanglement in criminal associations of the mafia, at that time at a compensation sum of 10 million euros.
"Despite any kind of moral and legal standard," the lawyers wrote, "the two local authorities had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"This made it possible for the Mafia Group – the judges say – to enter the City Halls officially and to agree on public administration policy."
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region it is "all but an exception to encounter links between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically unavoidable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which the Clan Piromalli police decapitated.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition after the election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in this in the Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, who accused him of inventing everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, said that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From a hearing campaign in connection with the Dal Torrione case investigations, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has shown that the public administration measures have become identical with the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes out of the waves, suddenly the great ones run up
It is an undefiled source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet and only now does this seem to understand the great energy companies of the world.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all look at now and also seek to occupy, such as giants as Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not by chance intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke down around 1980, the idea of marine energy was forgotten, but now environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy demand could be covered by the ocean waves.
This would be equivalent to twice the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company that now relies on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are focusing on marine energy generation.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – according to the speaker of a company known to the American giant in the Wall Street Journal – and weighs the possibility of working with us."
It is a question of obtaining approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off Alaska's coast.
This is an unestimated sign, especially when we consider that oil is still being promoted by the United States in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers are talking about an increasing interest.
Even better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still emerging, not least since the last doubts have not yet been resolved by the environmentalists.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, there is a need for technologies with a far greater impact on the environment.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
It drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent via underwater pipelines to the coast.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for state approval. Part of the energy generated could also be used for military facilities.
However, Verdant Power is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot with the help of underground turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movement during the tides drives the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Research, a particular interest deserves immediately the potential that is in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore a more trustworthy power source.
It is precisely tidal energy that led states such as New York, Maine and Alaska as well as other coastal states to invest already 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are planned for 2009.
