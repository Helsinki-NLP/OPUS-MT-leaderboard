Biker reacts fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his rapid reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at 9:30 p.m. with her VW from Merklingen.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24 year-old, pre-authorised motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away from the collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but it was still at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the strip operation, the hand and foot brake levers were demolished at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
At present, he steered his motorcycle in the green ladders next to the roadway and had it rolled out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, the biker suffered an injury at the bee and had to be treated in a clinic because of the collision with the car.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the outsourcing.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positively on the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we need to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for inlaying glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
In the yard infected were separated from non-infected employees, the grounds are now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPDs gave co-responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of seasonal workers' housing.
"This can be bitterly revenged if such local infection events have to take place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistoll, the Parliamentary Director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this quite similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
This obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come with an announcement.
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-olds fall into the trainbed after Schubser

Report: Seehofer insists on longer storage
Stock data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data, instead of the planned ten weeks, for half a year after a media report.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter to change the law quickly.
Seehofer therefore intends to step up measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to make "necessary adjustments to the law already now," the paper quotes from the letter.
Currently, the storage data storage is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
However, Mr Seehofer wants the amendments already before, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report goes on to say.
A spokesperson from the Ministry of Justice said that it would only be reasonable to consider whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already voted for a storage of data in June.
NBA: Strip Club Warrior for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is again in Isolation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, anm. d. R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams had decreed a ten-day quarantine.
The clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test-game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Soder expresses itself to the Corona location after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced on Sunday a tesoffensive for large farms.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has alarmed authorities and politics.
At present, almost 500 harvesters from several countries are working on the large vegetable farm, and over one third have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food supplies are delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the over 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"bitch of conscience": confession by the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," said the newspaper lawyer Quentin Chabert.
The defender added: "He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "tortured by conscience and very much taken away from the extent of destruction".
In the event of a conviction, according to the prosecutor's office, the man is threatened with ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged by a fire during the night on Saturday of last week.
The fire broke out in the church at three locations far away.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect now in custody had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
But he was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly entered the field of view of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," said Grindel of the "Picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that can become dangerous in the former Bavaria and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx."
He has doubts, however, whether the German Football League is prepared to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rules in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to achieve a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
The differences are therefore immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and went through the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's already been very busy to me in human terms."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a violation of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and careless.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB".
He never made a "heel out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Killer
The protests against police force in the United States have been further accentuated by Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.

Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defiance Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, people's masses and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Festzug, many of them were at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historians were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting the Rakoczy Festival Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
So did the Corona year this time.
The couple made it comfortable at the Luitpold-Casino, observed the historical flaning and listened to the Cuban live music at the playground restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhuizen.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic celebration and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy tourniquets are to be held again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who takes part in the celebration in a normal year and can be seen there on the coach of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking on Saturdays and Sundays in costume in the city.
"That's already more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The Reiterverein had less to do, even though individual riders were on the move in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrill will take place again next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021 a Rakoczy tourniquet will also take place again.
28 Corona Falls in Spanish Secondligist Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football cross-country player CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruña on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, a deep impact follows the next one.

The son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, was not opposed to the Corona rules set up by the Football Association, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there had been four infected persons until July 19, but all of them had been isolated and had not been evicted.
All players and team members were re-tested immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" additional team members of the Corona test would have been positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the pitch, said Tebas Llanas.

Bike pro Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time travel specialist Tony Martin thinks about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just with the team the framework conditions, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive some of its claims of around US$66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatening the state.
It would be the ninth non-payment in Argentine history.
Last but not least, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government maintains its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet US$503 million interest receivable and was therefore subject to a limited non-payment.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will join the successor of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelder Notariatsstelle.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral student took up the work, the normal daily business has long been on full tours.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time has not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently she is with her husband, who works as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, they now also have an overnight opportunity with their parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term to her.
When she visited her family in the past few months, she found out again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the competition for the free position.
In Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career her home in Lower Bavaria also plays a central role: After her Jura degree in Passau, she completed her referendariat time and the second State degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as notarassessorin, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - at this time she also "nearly" trained the doctorate in labour law - in 2012 she entered her first position as notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
She moved to Regensburg in 2016.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notaries.
When the position in Eggenfelden had been advertised because of Lutz Feller's near retirement, she saw the right time for full re-entry to work, the 39-year-old explained.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the vacation agency in the Notariatsstelle in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has prepared a praise for the firm's team: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the forthcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15.000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning to host 12,000 to 15,000 spectators according to the current state," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer.
Normally, the arena in the territory city in Bundesliga games occupies a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games of the previous season caused by the Corona pandemic, the BVB lost about four million euros per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization, hopes that, in addition to the normal audiences, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely broken."
In view of the persistent Corona crisis, all of them are currently "advised to take a stable side length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work alone in Germany, the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmund Marketing Manager praised the BVB professionals for their salary waiver, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that their pay drop has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 breakfasts, which are taken care of annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lung, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini-winds for them.
But not so small that they are not in voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if they don't scream as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from Theater der Stadt Aalen presented to the students the production "The Home Dress" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to share the play and performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
Born the idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy to enrich the teaching.
Even if all those involved agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would provide additional impetus, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the gaming business," said director Winfried Tobias.

The Warner Brothers film studio signed a contract for seven years and brought her out large at the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight films shot her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
She was also awarded much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Serpent Grube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her main role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The play was a global success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis she played in "Way Song for a Body".
From marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss Finale at Comeback
The 2nd World Cup Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Dusseldorf, they submitted their national teammates Nils Ehlers and Lars Fluggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semifinals.
In September of last year, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, her defeats against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde took place at 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured their tickets.
Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Fiegenblatt"
From the point of view of the FDP, Andreas Kalbitz's exclusion from the AfD is only a "face" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the Radicals in the AfD," said FDP member politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to remove right-wing extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been long excluded," said Strasser.
"There is, however, no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and changes nothing," he said, "The world on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD".
Flower assumes that the AfD will return to below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wings" by the Thuringian AfD-Landes- and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the strand as "secured right-wing extremist pursuit".
In May, the AfD Federal Councillor had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated an earlier membership in the now prohibited right-wing extremes "Home-faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesschidsgericht did not change the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has eaten only chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party will be weakened by this decision nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the mutiny troops is perceptible.
One wants to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and tries to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
There is no change in a waste," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD Landesverband and the Group continued to be their right leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he announced that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver well 21 percent more electricity
The wind turbines on the German North Sea fed electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year 11,51 Terawatt hours.
This is well 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator informed Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13.73 TWh, compared with 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
This means that wind harvesting at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due to wind conditions due to higher production capacity, as new wind farms have been set up over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea would all run simultaneously with full power, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this purpose; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections until then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot use their capacity at sea, but they reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2nd, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea windmills produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power stations.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a little anniversary celebration at the 130th.
Gmünder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent delivered the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
In the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in the awareness of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partylos).
"But in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had been streamed to the property and to the permanent tent, minimum distances, hygiene rules and a contact follow-up could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by several times.
Rumberg comforted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 as well as the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Not to beat dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four victories at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and not in the race.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold, Werth was in the special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the Germans were also in Kür on Quantaz before their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first pumpkin ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled there for 14 to 16 August.
Future air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University continues in the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility of enabling the start of the study not only in the summer but also for the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities in both the university and the DFS aviation security academy are equally used up.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management programme as part of their training for air traffic controllers at Worms University.
This year already nine students started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot's profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us to promote economically.
However, we are confident that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS's Executive Board when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation professorship is a future-proofing investment, which will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Foundation Professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it we want to link to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Air Safety Agency is both the motivation and the commitment of the University of Worms to further expand their teaching and research skills in the future fields of aviation.
In use for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first Stiftungsprofessorium for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue choppers land on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue helicopters were in use.
A 76-year-old drove with a Ford at 12.40 am in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve straight ahead and landed on the led plank.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered slight injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of around 2000 euros, had to be towed off.
Heil wants to check other sectors according to the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the states back to light in parts of the meat industry.
Law-enforcement is about to happen.
But are they right - and will they stay with it?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the strict regulations now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil der Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany's employer has already warned against restricting contracts in general.
After the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to pass a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to use foreign personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contract and hire workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on work contracts and employee transfers if you do not want to completely squander the economy".
For example, works contracts are mandatory for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and the plant construction industry as the basis for their value added to the customer.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts would make sense.
"When an industrial company instructs a craftsman to install a safety facility, this is a very normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and rental work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is not possible to explain why, in the future, the feeding and packaging of cheese should be subject to labour law other than that of sausage, according to an opinion on the legislative project, as the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contract companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW occupational safety and health department at least 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Pay has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But these have been bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now it's essential to clean up the mess".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to adopt at the end of July in the cabinet, there are also measures that not only concern the meat industry - such as higher labour protection test rates or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft proposed by dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry as well as to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staff posts are also needed for more controls.
Three dead at the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight aircraft crashed into a multifamily house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died as reported by the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, said a spokesman for Wesel County.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rhine Post" reported, referring to eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane crashed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
Rooming of Frankfurter Opernplatz proceed peacefully
A week after the outbursts in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera square at night on Sunday has also passed peacefully.
Finally, several dozen people stayed in the square, but left him at 1:00 before the start of the curfew.
The police had been in service since the early evening with numerous officials, and there was a greater police presence in the entire city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight on, a ban was imposed on the opera place, where Krawallen arrived a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrations.
At least five officers were injured after police arrest, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car passes: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 13:25.
She was taken to the hospital in Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible riders.
According to the police, the woman was on the 83nd highway heading towards her home in Hümme, when her car came off the road from an unexplained cause and crossed over several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched by the rotary conductor with a thermal camera.
Also the Drone Staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the planters did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken to Kasseler Klinikum by the rescue car.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was blocked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a Redemptive Gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, the record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total 36th scudetto of the club history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which without the last long wounded ex-national player Sami Khedira arrived, is no longer to displace two days before the end of the season of series A.
The table width of Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half of the year, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free-throat variant.
One example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penal border directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved with the more offensive guests at 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi dusted off (67th).
This ensured the impeccable but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter shot at the latte in the 89th minute probably only Ronaldo himself with a view to the score of the goal hunter.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically for 90 minutes at ball height.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve also had to deal with the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the Sunday game, the Sarri team had only five wins.
It's questionable whether Ronaldo will also become a goalie king.
For while the Portuguese superstar had reached 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobe, after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the Lazio Rome table-fourd at Hellas Verona, has already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern title win.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015/2016 season, Argentina scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus is in the eighth final of the Champions League, but on August 7th against Olympique Lyon has to make a 0:1 match to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent in the next K.o. round.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - In spite of all the punishments and court rulings threatened by all, drivers in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg streets continue to gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the South West have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although comparative values do not exist for the years before, the shavers are increasing the work of the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 prosecutions were conducted for illegal races in the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request by the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, drivers would have come up against each other spontaneously, or they would have taken refuge from the police - even this is indicated as an illegal race.
At the tax, mainly German men were between 18 and 60 years of age.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases will the shavers be caught and also asked for a checkout: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonments have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more often, said a minister spokesperson.
Rasern is particularly popular with the Autobahn 8. Automobiles are constantly slowing down traffic there in order to get space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular racetrack
On the A81, the police even recorded more races than on any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, there is an attempt to brake the shave on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the geishing.
The mostly high-priced and up-to-date sports and luxury car bodies often have Swiss distinguishing marks, because the drivers avoid lawn to Germany because of the high penalties for fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced on a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km, we would manage this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD Landtagsfrektion.
"The hemm threshold for shavers would be much higher if you didn't have to be legally 200 km away and more on the road."
Rivoir holds less of education or image campaigns: "He who in such a way goes beyond all the rules and not only risks his own life, but also the lives of other road users is inconceivable with reason."
ADAC calls for more police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not sufficient: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even more stringent controls on the routes concerned.
It is not rare that the high-speed force measurement is more painful and more severe: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the race, two of whom have not been involved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men reportedly delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, banged against a garden wall and remained on the side that 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the last two years.
However, more severe punishments are not necessary in the opinion of Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: "Legistical action is not seen in the paper of the Ministry of the Interior in order to penalize illegal motor vehicles.
Blue light from July 23rd: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snacks
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Creis Calw) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley street around 3.40 a.m. and ran toward the snack.
There he noticed a man who used to drink on the fridge and then left the snack through a previously opened door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory at the closing stage at Sibiu Tour
At the closing stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour, Radprofi Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory.
The 26-year-old palsy of the team Bora-hansgrohe continued in mass print on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the three and four seasons for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger went through.
The 26-year-old had decided to ride the mountain time on his own in the morning and thus took over the top in the classification.
Only 104 riders had arrived at the closing stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountain-time driving.
"I am really happy to start the season reboot with a victory," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters in front of the target he just put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a Corona test was conducted six days before the start of the race with all race participants and their companions.
During the complete tour, drivers and supervisors were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organization team and from the media.
Spectators at the start and destination were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for the lay reinvigoration
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multifamily house, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to fire brigade, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
"A commanding officer immediately gave instructions on the lay reanimation," said a firefighter to BILD.
The incoming rescue forces took the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child at risk of life was transported to the university clinic under re-invigoration.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police have routinely initiated investigations into an accident.
The firefighter spokesperson: "We expect a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nürnberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police invading, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated in a "Tuning Meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police launched their announcement to control such events more closely.
A big tuning meeting came on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's South Town.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia Police, an increase in the number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstader Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police had announced that they would want to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the "scene"
The officials counted at the top well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police billed.
However, only a small part of the "Autoposer" and Tuning scene are present.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons present on the ground, it is assumed that this was mainly a showcasing event.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in the current infectious protection regulations, in particular the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nasal protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at 1:00 a.m.
In total, in 10 vehicles, officials found that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There have been no illegal car races.
"The Middle Franconian Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the events and will continue to carry out reinforced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of showy people," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger about the involved towing company: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Even because the cars are wider, the company had to be careful not to cause any damage.
"The young people should finally keep their cars intact."
Number of jobs agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) reports that around 900 suspicious cases of abuse of short-time workers pay have been reported.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have indicated short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test lasted up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
All the more so will we look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot of work to do.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
There are often indications of abuse by the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvency than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the revivors of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening some young people would have played Rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by riders, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Time and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always collections where the rules of distance and hygiene of the Covid-19 handling regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without Corona regulation, the parks are closed when darkness breaks in.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are few exceptions.
For a long time, the Foundation has complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage behind and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party during the night to Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: mass tests after Corona eruption in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the State authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still available in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young interns in tourism businesses have been tested positively, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Weiser, the dpa.
Guests also had to leave early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about one third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the practitioners who had celebrated in several places and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he said to radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of Corona distribution throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea Qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football recordmaster Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third place of the table with a 2:0 (0.0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be satisfied with the Europa League, because the FC Chelsea was still passing and qualified as a fourth for the king class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United was led by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the replay time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to an end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won against the Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2.0).
"This means a lot to me," said Trainer Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as a Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, who went past the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided to use the Watford FC and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble around the class at West Ham United for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) compared to Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three trainers in the season, goes off after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
A point was missing at the end.
FC Liverpool, who has been established as an English champion since the end of June, has secured a record of the club with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp missed the score in English football with his team just barely.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütte van Dijk after the game, "that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the Coronavirus crisis, the football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature interruption or a performance of the remaining games on neutral soil was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be played in the end without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Head of Government Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
There have been violent conflicts in the night.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police were violently opposed to a demonstration against the right-wing Conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people had been arrested for participating in unrest, police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld announced.
The police used, among other things, water guns to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports on Saturday evening, some 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's county seat.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The Protestants beat drums, blew their horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of an area demonstration who supported Netanyahu had also been arrested, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police reports near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying from a moving car pepper spray on protestors on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a mass attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured on the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The conferences accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is expected to have rapid relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was most recently higher than 20 per cent.
The number of re-infections with the Coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to always new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A ride accident claimed nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen.
One car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said, "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn away."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen it too late.
He was powerful on the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers were injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several rescue cars took them to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea rules out border town to Corona case
North Korea has so far seen a "lighting success" in its own measures to ward off the Corona virus.
Now the country reports for the first time on a case of suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona case in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a big city because of fear of disaster.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the evil virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation had been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the decapitated country.
North Korea had so far not registered a single infection according to its own data and described its defence measures as "excellent success".
The data were doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were found in a "outbreaker" who had illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had resigned three years ago to South Korea and had now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly mutilated military buffer zone there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea after reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
There have been investigations into some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday an emergency meeting of the political bureau of the Workers' Party chaired by Maj. Kim Jong Un was called on account of the suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered as a preventive measure on Friday, "to block Kaesong completely and to isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, had been quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
Some 300,000 people live in Kaesong, according to estimates.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the bodies will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale project "Central Development-East", says rather casually in the middle of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the eastern city, however, is discussed until the end.
The majority of them are scarce, at least in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which emerged from citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council now failed after almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticised as "extraparliamentary opposition", "unimaginable", "spectuation", "disgusting" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the Municipal Council for one year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens list.
In fact, after reading the contracts in this position, he was: "I know what I'm talking about".
The city's exit is cheaper, the city's technical town hall is, contrary to the statements of the city administration, after grants whose existence small is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently when one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the advocates from the economy.
The city by its own power and not by making an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejected the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller part of the city centre remodelling ideally with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
For example, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise, caused by road traffic, including often temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club in Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this would have to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD, by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned-out rhythms and by little commitment to cycling.
The Municipal Council also agrees on the participation of the City of the Energy and Climate Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, it is on the agenda of accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Change Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day-care centres and the request for inclusion in the Federal Smart City Fund.
Citizens are welcome, but have to take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31st.
Before the Supersports Car League can start regular operation, the first test runs started.
Zimmermann was particularly concerned with getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first mission in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already some things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go to the curves differently.
But it really did have a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in the GT sport, the Dutch have been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," said Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand us blindingly and we have also made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also perform his first race.
From 31 July the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015, he was a guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get a little used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the beginning of a densely pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Presently, the stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at the Nürburgring, ex-formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will reach the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision caught cold
The British Government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidays after their return for two weeks has, according to press reports, caught the country's Minister of Transport cold.
So Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided the measure.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so that also Shapps will have to go back to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rules apply to those who are just on the holiday holiday, only from Saturday, August 1st, and were not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers will be imposed in Spain," commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly one month after the end of Corona's emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe curfew, the numbers of infections in the country are rising again.
Virologists are primarily responsible for the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite countries in Britain.
The British Government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of British holidaymakers who are particularly popular in Canaries and Balearic Islands.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel Coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Marine Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced to the Navy's day in his country an outfit of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian maritime forces would be extended, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed the agency of successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket built for the Marine.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
It was also built on the nuclear submersible submersible torpedo Poseidon, it was called.
The planned drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has as large a coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, said Putin on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also on many other Russian coasts, the sea forces began the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting on the side of the ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated the strength of Tartus at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port.
Munitions were fired there, too.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense, not only were warships, including a submarine, but also fighter helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona Hardened
Washington - The first hurricane of this season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency NOAA announced at night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas made the work of the helpers difficult, said Abbott, according to the US media.
Evacuated to Caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper Huuston Chronicle.
In view of the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated if one considers that it is sweeping through an area most affected by the Covid-19 region of the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called for careful attention to be given to those who had to leave their homes.
You should not disregard "practice to which we have become accustomed", such as the wearing of masks, said the governor according to the sender CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have been provided in some places.
In addition, emergency rooms should be tested on Corona.
First, damage had only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning taken back
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island on land just off the Texan coast.
The tropical storm had previously been elevated to the hurricane of the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had been issued and later taken back.
The authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continued to move into the interior of the country and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the Hurricane Centre expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, he is supposed to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, after a May forecast, the NOAA expected an above average active hurricane season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong whirlwinds, the Authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which become storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, which was one below average even at ten percent, it was then called.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the states concerned.
Four Tores known: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric were immediately recognized two goals
Naples - Four Gates scored, four gates won: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a rough black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league series A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
Never has the VAR been so hard on a team," commented Corriere dello Sport.
Host Naples had taken the lead through a gate of Elseid Hisaj, an outside defender, in the 8th minute, in which Filip Djuric initially applauded the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) took the hit back because of an off-site position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again, the VAR intervened.
Also the gates of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) took the referee team back after the Var.
During the replay, Allan made the 2:0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology ensures records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began for Double Winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who was behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Middle Field Chief Joshua Kimmich to show the third-most effort minutes, suffered a band injury on the left foot and threatened to miss in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich dirt weather, the right-wing defender broke down a training game and was driven with a golf card from the place.
How long the unrestricted tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final rematch against FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, and the 24-year-old may hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12th.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mischief from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victorious title collectors in the 28 days to the end of the king-class game on August 23rd.
"We have just mastered the duties with championship and trophy.
Now it's time to do the special thing," said Flick.
Until the Munichers can take a concrete look at the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve, however, the eight-final duty against the FC Chelsea is set for the first time.
After the 3:0 game in front of the Corona break, the Londoners in the local arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again like in the lost "finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust with a good game," said Flick.
A vote-in test is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had had 13 days off after the double, on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on the Sabener Straße, including the new players to buy noble Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the square for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been a good fit like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. can no longer just train with them, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German Series Champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter finale against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semifinals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the finale in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the chief coach, who has been able to rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training since Tuesday.
The WM recorder Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100-vote.
With his current team the work was "a pleasure," she praised.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with Neuner teams also took an ambitious turn on Sunday.
All of the service providers were involved, including the emigrationist Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay is not guaranteed beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to qualify its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup title.
All America races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and the Portimão in Portugal will be held.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight for World Cup points on the Italian traditional racetrack in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar includes 13 races according to the current state.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in the king class of motorsport in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, before the already officially announced races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Regulation requires races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least race on three continents for the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles under "exceptional circumstances" because of the Coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the emerging Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absorb encounters criticism in Brazil
Because of the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The cancellation of the America Races was particularly critical in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but the reasons for it we cannot accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the infection rates in the São Paulo region are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams not wanting to go to Brazil would not justify any rejection.
It was prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's famous latent show by video switch and revealed what she had in her head during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular U.S. show via video switch.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the mighty in the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
She now spoke in a well-known latent show about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latteright moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed Thunberg 17 on Tuesday in your show and conducted a longer interview with the Swedes.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children are going on the road," she experienced.
Head of State and leading politicians, who mocked or even try to silence them in social media, find it "funny", as they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a famous scene in which she gave U.S. President Trump a bitter look afterwards.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the aktvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at the moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there's any further explanation."
With the ready-made answer, the experienced Satiriker Colbert had probably not expected and disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How were you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in memory at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder real estate with three pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race around Europe's Golden Shoe with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobe has continued to have the best chances of becoming a goalie king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three hits at the 5:1 (1:1) win of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two turned 11 meters into the follow-up times of both halves.
Thus, the 30-year-old of the table-fourd two season games before the end now has 34 season doors on his account - just as many achieved Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo followed with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steep downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporters: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all the former and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the longtime legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dream instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid ascent - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970 three years after it was founded.
It followed a social descent.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographies reported.
Green was treated in the psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture area.
He should have lived on the road for a while, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In his early years, he was enthusiastic about American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of 11, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager started to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
He was soon involved in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not survive the media rumble, his experiments with the drug LSD became ever more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac is now swimming on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold itself over 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not succeed in a bigger comeback until he started off with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released some albums free of drugs with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend already in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
