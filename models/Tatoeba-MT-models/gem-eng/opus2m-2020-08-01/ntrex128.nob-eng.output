Welsh MPs do not want to appear as ‘muppets’
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, currently known as AM (Assembly Members), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A representative from the Labour Workers' Party explained his group was concerned because ‘it rhymes on Twp and Pwp.’
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means "dustete", and pwp means "bash".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was ‘dissatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the conservative party said that his group was ‘open’ to the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British word for ‘dust’.
In this context, Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way to the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing laws to introduce the change of name, said: ‘It is of course the members themselves who have the last right of destination as to the name to be referred to them.’
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the reopening of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the representatives’ title, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option received the most support during the public consultation.
The representatives seem to suggest other alternatives, but getting all the parties to reach an agreement could lead to a head start for President Elin Jones, who is scheduled to deliver a draft legislative text for the change of name over the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national Parliament, including rules on the disqualification of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last vote on what they should be called when debating the law.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia can vote on whether to change the name of their country to ‘the Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The support players of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's style – the crickets in Harlem wear
"The old people I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Now there are none of the parts.’
He said the bar's absence was understandable.
"People associate socially in other ways" now, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, all of which are regularly visited.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe.
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining resorts.
“The vast majority of those buying apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these peoples who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Committee moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that had held close by took over the building.
St. Martin's got a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of traders on 125th Street – one of Harlem's main handlers – because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 caused great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioner made plans for the reconstruction, they bought a carillon.
Prest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was «the church bells of the poor people».
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noticed that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are initiated by the church's lay people's leadership and others by the diocese.
The Church Council — the administration of the church, composed of laymen — wrote to the bishops in July about his concern that the diocese was going to ‘try to impose costs’ on the Council of Churches, despite the fact that the Council of Churches had not been involved in the initiation of the architects or contractors sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark hurts thirteen-year-old lobster swimmers in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends in about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help, and that he and a group of others swam over to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he at first thought that the boy cried out by enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but he realized that the boy cried out 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His whole collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried out that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported with an air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had serious injuries in the upper torso.
The authorities closed shore access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its contribution to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's challengers Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with department store-like makeup and beauty shelves, manned by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are being tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong intake in the United Kingdom’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is constantly experiencing growth while sales figures for clothing and household goods fall.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the efforts of the supermarket to find a new area of use that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said that they will double the number of beauty products they offer to 3000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, that the store chain has never sold before.
Existing product range from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better space in noted brand areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its boutique make-up brand with mainly vegan products, as this demand is growing among younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in southern London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online commerce and a new tendency to buy small quantities of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to arrive.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales are going to look more and more like a commodity magazine, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade the beauty and pharmacies departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after a dispute concerning the distribution of the income of the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store cookies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain, GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the look and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our selection of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us a beauty-care competitor that represents a new experience of action."
Peter Jones is “crazy” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones is supposed to be furious after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million contract with his lifestyle label to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories brand, Truly.
Their company was previously compared with the Gwyneth Paltrows brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is the programme manager in This Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle label for the last second to focus on their own new gold-edge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “rare” at an appropriate meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here that the television girl admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time left for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The company has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows' brand, Goop, and it was expected that it would double Willoughby's estimated wealth of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on her way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long-term investment that would give her financial security over the next decades.
Everyone is totally shocked that she has chosen to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at the headquarters of Marlow that is now ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning Programme Manager, which is among the most popular stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company several million pounds because of large investment in products such as cushions and lights, fashion and cos clothes, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% holding in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S brand ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity ITV programme.
A source standing near Jones said yesterday «We won't comment on his business affairs».
Checkboxes "and then we fell in love"
He knew about the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment some would regard as “little presidential”, and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have given away nothing at all.’
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big mess on the road to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States to its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead the United States still has sanctions that aim to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a gathering of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
‘We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as putting an end to rocketsters, helping to get the hostages released and getting the lives of American service personnel sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed in the area right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia are raging an island and killing hundreds of people
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, non-resident NPISHs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of more than 10 % of Lombok residents, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be submitted.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite challenging,’ said Sumbung.
The children are now putting together a team to travel to Palu, but are not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Emergency Management Unit, said that Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Given the constant earthquakes to which Indonesia is exposed, the country is terribly poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Lights to protect against tsunamis are built in Aceh, but they are not a common view along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning signal on Palu, although an alert had been issued, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Even in the best of circumstances, travelling between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's ready-to-fall infrastructure a major feature of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and the railway.
But lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in the fight against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from the Premier League defeat against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the fight at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea measurement while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it towards the longest corner.
The test went high above the box as the ball fell towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball as well as possible in the future, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and hit the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kick it further.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a briefing with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before changing his direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's orbit half.
Kovacic made a quick handover on the midway.
He then fired a great breakthrough fit that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group game of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The death tolls from tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The deaths of Indonesia's earthquakes and tsunami have increased to 832, notified the country's crisis management agency early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six metres, explained the staff member Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with materials from damaged buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for killing after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation is under way after the corpse of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about making contact.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says, 'We're at the very beginning of the investigation, but I want to ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something on their car camera, to make contact – they may have information that is essential to our investigation.”
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the late woman was resident in Birkenhead, and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated when he told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She repeats ‘it’s so horrible’ over and over again.
At 14 o'clock, two police cars were behind the lockdown, while a third car was just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the lockdown and were overseeing the apartment complex.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the controversy about «rewriting history»
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing house as 'bad' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace was also going to be a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic presentation of Cromwell is a proof of the 1800s' opinions and is part of the historiography of a man many still think deserves to be hailed.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: «Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more late in the 1800s than today, seen as Parliament's defender against outside pressure – of course in his time it was about the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Suckling pig takes the life of Chinese peasants
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in south-west China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a broken artery near a binge on the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, South China reported Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to place vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai province of China.
He had apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig's path stood open.
He said that inside the piggy there was a big mess with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
"Right to my cousin was bloody and maltrated" explained the cousin, referred to by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera footage showed that Yuan went into the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His corpse was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Yuan's family and market management are apparently negotiating compensation for death.
Even if the scepter happens, it's not the first time it's been registered that a pig has infected people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on a Massachusetts farm and caused serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer's wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the common, but that the taste of blood can have a triggering effect.
‘They only play.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
All you have to do is show proper respect.’
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will lead to severe rain in south-west America
As reported, the Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will flood on her way through north-Mexico and south-west-USA during the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a hurricane of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity northwards towards south-west U.S.A.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the interaction between tropical humidity and the thread approaching will lead to widespread heavy rain in the south-west over the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain leads to dangerous floods, liquid rushes and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will lead to rates of precipitation of up to 5-7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5–10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the South West, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains can lead to river valleys becoming broad roaring rivers, and thunders will lead to local gusts of wind that can contain dust and sand.
The approaching route will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along the southern California.
A total rainfall of over 1,3 cm is possible, which can lead to a liquid rush and rapid, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the area's first rainfall.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets colder but the tropics stay very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout Central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are likely to get a hot start on October, with degrees high on the twenties from Southern Plains to parts of north-east America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that East America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, divided into six TV networks, saw Thursday's gripping testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who has accused him of a sexual assault that must have taken place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual broadcasts to announce Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it became apparent that the senator for Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court commission that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average viewer counts for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
See figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Moreover, Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
In order to give a little perspective, this number of viewers is equivalent to the final game of the American football championship or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-makers have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average viewer of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a court hearing while protesters shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with a lowered eye for several minutes while he was being peeled out, while the incident was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said a woman.
«Do you think he's telling the country our truth?»
He was told that "you have the power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office has come up with an opinion, and said as the elevator doors closed he was going to have more to say about the matter at committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be continued to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with her friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake made her decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choice had a great impact, when it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of ‘political games’ around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to play ‘political games’ with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interests of the nation.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom September 29, 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to obtain each other’s tariffs was ‘very ridiculous’.
Wayde Sims shooting: The police are attacking Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of causing the death of the LSU player
The police have apprehended a man who is suspected of having shot and killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and targeted for intentional killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basket.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admits to having shot and killed Wayde.
His deposit is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The forensic surgeon in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a shot wound in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for its working group on the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for contributing to the investigation that led to an attack.
LSU’s sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local police force for his ‘hard work and the pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "cracked" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Volcano sprays ash over Mexico by
The ash spewing out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's Public Emergency Prevention Office, warned Mexico's population on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in one day.
The establishment monitored several cases of bulging and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash that covered windscreens on the cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as ‘Don Goyo’, has been active since 1994.
Police in clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters for independence had a clash with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demonstration stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the rebel police, and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The handcuff also broke out later in the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independent demonstrators shouted ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face to face with unionist demonstrators calling ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for minor damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the liberation-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming superiority for release, but it was a poor appearance because the vote was boycotted by most who opposed the liberation.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote that was held at polling stations throughout the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prosthesis with his wife, said that he no longer had any hopes about Catalonia's ability to become independent.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to get a voice, but now we're stuck," he told me.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalan independence have had difficulties in maintaining pressure this year, as many of their known leaders have travelled in self-imposed exile or are in custody while awaiting legal proceedings for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is aroused by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned pending a court case since late last year, announced that he will be at the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best thing I can do to condemn the repression and the regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Mengas Attack Leads to Livingston’s 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Intrigued Livinston astounded Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga turned out to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won the way out of the Premier League this season and will be playing against the leaders of Hearts, which is eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will be playing home fight against Rapid Wien in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has kept himself innocent through six battles in the division. Chief Holt has not lost a fight yet after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for her sleepy guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but bombed on the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett's header past the goal.
The host let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for their guests at the death ball.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers gave off a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga clear track, and he scored a goal from the middle of the box.
At this stage the Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the home team's defense had proved to be impenetrable and purposeful Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a near-coring that had to be rescued by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston death ball into a wide short-fitting.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston box and were still being rescued, while two penalties – one time after Halkett’s protest against exchange Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were ignored.
‘Phenonomial’ from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were amazing all of them, and they continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got to the top again, but Holt is going to have much of the credit for the way he has strengthened his creation after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated an enormously well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toe lifting throughout the game.
Rangers, on the other hand, didn't have my inspiration to sign up with.
Even though they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they couldn't live up to this standard.
The last part of the fight was labs – they only got into the home layer's track half once – and it was a bit of a wake-up for Rangers, which is right in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday September 29th, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
Issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU have been debated.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police gave security as the reason why a population of 25 000 was not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard from him, criticizing both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the rift that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Collision: Cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision like a passenger car in London.
The collision took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford south-east of the city, about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by ambulance staff, but the man died on site.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a car crash where the driver escaped from the crime scene on Children's Street, about one kilometer from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the relatives.
Roadblocks and roundabouts are in place, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Rebels broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and are still in progress.
Specialised ‘Tornado’ officers have been brought in to handle the incident, involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
One prison spokesman said: ‘Specialised prison staff have been sent to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police, and may have to spend even more time behind locks and beats.”
HMP Long Lartin lives more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the rebel police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which the employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (may be beneficial for drought areas)
It is the spring of Arizona taken by a tropical lowland, but precisely it is likely to happen early next week, as the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and brings flood hazards.
National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday night.
National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border with Arizona.»
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongolia Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the south-west desert, including the middle of the mountain chain Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to range between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those who are outside the flood hazard, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this precipitation is likely to be beneficial, since south-west America is currently in a drought state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa still has the hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and loses power.
Therefore, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storm power on Monday evening or afternoon.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico can be severe and lead to great flooding.
«Total rainfall of 7.5–15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm rainfall», according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical lowland, which this moves further through Arizona and into the southern Utah within the late Tuesday evening.
‘The great-grandfather expected of Rosa or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, north-western Sonora and the south-west desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This precipitation is expected to produce life-threatening floods and liquid rushes and fast in the desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attacks for Killing Attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are under arrest, suspected of attempted killing, after a 16-year-old was found the knife piece in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
The police have asked anyone who can have a mobile recording of the incident to make contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has ‘suffered under the petty and mind’ of the democratic party
‘A vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in favour of rejecting the reckless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party’, said Trump in front of a popular meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has ‘suffered under the petty and mind’ of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the Congress on Thursday, and denied the strong and emotional charges of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual assault on her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies to his accusation during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw where brilliant, capable and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of our most capable lawyers of our time, with flawless public service conduct’, he told a meeting of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discrepancy to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to vote in the middle elections.
«We are five weeks away from one of our most important lifelong choices.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.’
Trump claimed that the democrats aim at ‘resistance and prevention’.
The Senate's first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to the CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves thundered in land around the sunset, destroying everything in their way and dragged many into drowning death.
The tsunami came into the heels of an earthquake of strength 7.5.
‘When the tsunami father occurred yesterday, people still engaged in activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims’, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s Crisis Management Unit (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘Tsunami was not alone – it took cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,’ Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.’
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Air photography published by the crisis management kit showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershock continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Use Department (BPPT) said in a statement that the power from Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami larger, according to the floor.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘comprehensive’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and injuries could be the coast of the larger country 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication ‘was completely deformed, without any information’ from Donggala.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.’
On Saturday the department was strongly criticized for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared on social media you hear a man on the top floor of a building crying desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water descends toward the beach, tearing with it buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power breach that prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city airport is only open for relief work, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death tolls after the tsunami in Indonesia are rising above 800.
It's so cruel.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to the Palu Centre, where they have sought shelter under the tarpaulin tent in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Dosheba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of damaged houses," he said.
It's so cruel.
As aid organisations began to prepare desperately for crisis relief, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be allocated to a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a provincial disaster’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘When the government says ‘Great, this is a national disaster’, we can open up the borders of international aid, but the situation has not got any status yet.’
As the sun descends over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hope that their love will be among the miracles that brighten up the gloomy news picture of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday a woman was freed by rescue teams after spending two days trapped under the ruins with the corpse of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the Asian Games, which was conducted earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those who were caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandadi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to bear," he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate whatsApp messages to the practitioners who participated in the beach festival at Palu.
But the messages only led to grey heel marks, rather than a pair of blue heel marks.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under mini-banking in Newport on the Life
On Friday morning the thief stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied a mini bank in the entertainment complex and got ready to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who was “running up behind the Brink’s staff” and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses so many suspected escapes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: «The creation was previously known as Kanye West.»
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the show, after she cancelled on an "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also varied between the use of hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's acceding president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he ‘will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people’.
Military troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements were raging across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening up several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education lead young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and the performer of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be the number 1 innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
‘A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough’, said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next great achievement of artificial intelligence comes from the United States," Lee told me in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of the Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop an artificial intelligence system that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese Department.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's former technology contests, like Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government funding, according to Lee.
“It’s not China that steals the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive an offer of a residence permit automatically," he said.
The China State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other state agencies distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defense Department created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at establishing a national safety commission on artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the ‘Republic of Northern Macedonia’ in order to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia, considers that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for Greek territory and has vetoed them to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has raised doubts as to whether the attendance will meet the minimum requirement of 50%, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot box is: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership when approving the agreement with Greece’.
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to become members of organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the country’s future, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us’, said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be crucial because a high enough number of Members have said that they will comply with the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said they had not received any irregularities reports by 13.00.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
‘I came to vote because of my children – we belong in Europe’, said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country’s name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who are to boic eight votes.
‘We are positive to NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with a raised head, not let in the back,’ says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of the European integration.’
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to a serious need for investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be too, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO’, says Zaev after voting.
He says that a ‘yes’ answer will be a ‘confirmation of our future’.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43% of the voting rights will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required attendance.
Another study, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they were going to vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle the pro-Western government has encountered since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Cities Sergio Aguero maneuvers past the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2–0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal for 65 minutes.
The Argentine Attack Player received a pass at the start of the sequence.
He raced about with three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton-box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoe to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
‘Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems’, the City Manager told Pep Guardiola to the press.
“We talked about that he was going to play 55–60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a goal right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League game.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough fit along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling towards the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was above the skyline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to be on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who lead the Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5–2 win over Nationals Friday night, but is still out to secure their first division title.
Although we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level I get to play at this year.
Why wouldn't I participate in it?'
The Nationals have still not advertised their starting pitcher for Sunday, but should apparently be inclined to take the Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand Washington player has won this season 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump’s West Virginia People’s Assembly
The President referred discrepancy to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nominees Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans voting at the midpoint elections.
«All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued ‘You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
The democrats, he said, aim to ‘resistance and prevent’.
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinny and bad and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate's court commission and mentioned the democratic senator Diane Feinstein by name, on which the audience bowed loudly.
«Do you remember her answer?
Did you play the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who make sense.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
I am, after all, the last in a large number of Labour Members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of having responsible economic policies, on national security, on Europe — ironically, quite similar issues to those of Jeremy who disagreed with previous leaders.
At the notice of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
In most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday evenings have been just that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of ‘softer, friendlier’ policies is too far forgotten, if it ever began.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political views with suddenly began to expect me to take a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, they agreed on the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it has nothing to say what I say – I receive a lot of bad messages on social media that require me to be dismissed, condemns center politics and tells me that I should not be in Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know that I'm luckier than any of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sex-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be cuddled.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of gross outreach.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we're no longer such a party that's open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and every change in electoral rules gets the party narrower.
I have received a lot of advice in the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice that much, because it will ‘make everything better’.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had led to my classroom in the public school I attended being literally ready to fall, I have fought for better public services for those who need them the most, both as local councillor and minister of government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political views or disagreements with current management.
To those who made the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that since the country is raging our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot grasp and understand the desire to waste time and strength on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best serves their interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unbesieged Ayr ascends to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only ones undefeated by the ten.
Finally, there was as much of their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities they had that led to the home team leaving with the victory, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still uninjured, so I must be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honour to Ayr, they were better at using the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14 minute trial, with the target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr management, but a yellow card to Scotland's captain Rory Hughes, loaned from Warriors, let Melrose smooth the position, and Jason Baggot performed a test without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty park before he, just before the break, scored and the goal park, made a solo attempt to change the position to 17–5 at break.
But Melrose started second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This became a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried out on the stretcher, and from the start, Ayr's management increased even more than an experiment from Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of it to have an extra man on the track to the fullest with an experiment from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team nevertheless came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for having tackled Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the inflection behind the advancing Ayr-mole.
Climo accomplished a goal park, so he did again almost completely from the start, after Kyle Rowe obtained David Armstrong's boxing park and sent flanker Gregor Henry abducted for the home team's fifth attempt.
The Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game-star Ford Kieran is on his way into the catering industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a gifted restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program, for which he writes and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfill.
The pigeon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that K run now plans life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the Director of A driftstorn Limited.
The actor would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kläpp wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s ‘living restaurant business’.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a land without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigged Marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: «We are right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire inland state of Bolivia has continued to refresh its memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs after once again being able to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in several decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has a driving force, Community spirit and calm of mind, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive attitude’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the verdict of the International Court of Justice on a large screen in many different places in the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give its opinion in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile — after decades of sporadic negotiations — is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year – has also made a lot of effort on Monday’s reputation.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give up Chilean land, and has stipulated that it will not decide the outcome of any negotiations.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the judgment of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have actually made things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration’ said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has wiped out any remaining goodwill on the part of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations on one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court's decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, Monday will provide Bolivia with ‘an exceptional opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile’ and the possibility to ‘stop 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both parties’.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales — which is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the maritime situation as a political hideout.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific’, he added.
“The feeling is an opportunity to see what we have to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Secretary of State Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust American authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to respect the promises they made during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems ready to launch the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" that continued sanctions and American resistance to is a statement that will ever end the Korean War will force North Korea to kneel.
The US authorities are sceptical about accepting the declaration without Pyongyang first implementing significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to give up on an arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo has plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in huge headgear, which is heading towards a clothing store near you
If you want to have some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne stripped off a selection of strange, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel lions on the modeuka in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their conspicuous creations down the catwalk.
Valentino's most eye-catching garment was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide brim that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-peared watermelons, a wizard hat or even a pineapple, but they are not made to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also extracted a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had renovated their lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One created the memory of diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, then you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be heading towards a dress shop near you.
The oversized hats come straight into the heels of the ‘La Bomba’, the straw hat with a half-meter wide brem that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another great creation down the catwalk – a beachbag in straw that is almost as large as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffieves, which are edged with raffia fringes and supplemented with a white skin handle, was the most striking creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the motel in Paris.
The know-how stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: «I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing stores the next summer – when the designer has had such an impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.»
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The fresh schools of Scotland are constantly exhibiting academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another year of excellent exam results. These are supported by individual and joint successes in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and are working hard to deliver the very best school experience to both pupils and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As an educational institution that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and sought-after electoral profession in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when his words say his head.
If thou speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart shall be fulfilled.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of passing time from fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the exam character A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Swedish University Council showed that 72 percent of students got the exam A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also got A.
This illustrates that in Scotland, health schools support foreign languages as a decisive skill for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language selection is now valued at the same level as science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons stated by employers for difficulties in filling a job vacancy, 17 per cent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in order to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter which career you choose.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those related to emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in the languages considered to be the most valuable for the United Kingdom on the road towards 2020, for example mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a range of languages to choose from in-health schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scottish schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as ‘international communication capability’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'll have a beer faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost to fans who want to watch LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in Sunday's preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not determined.
‘There will be more than one and less than 48’, said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
"I don't need to fight for the season at this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump People's Meeting Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a number of election meetings tonight, Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned public meetings over the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the forthcoming interim elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voters go to the polls in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia people meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, Vest-Virginia is scheduled to start at 19.00 ET this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's people's meeting in West Virginia online via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's hearings for the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, charged with sexual assault.
With the main objective of all these people's meetings, it is to support Republicans facing a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that over the next few weeks, these five people's meetings aim to "warn volunteers and supporters by trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season,” Reuters heard from a campaign spokesman for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening public meeting, scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract support players from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh press’, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is on the polls.
"It's a good sign to Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost to polls," said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fighting spirit to keep their faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely concocted sport concept, but still something the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led by six points and now there are four, so we carry it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the track for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage – they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they've got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep revelries became higher as his round continued, and sank to a decisive putting to raise the match to a draw when he and Thomas lay two below after two.
His putting, which won them the game of 15, was met with a similar scream – by the variety that shows that he still doesn't believe that the American team is beyond chance.
"We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own game," said Spieth.
That's all of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but lovely couples have four out of four and don't put a foot wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who avoided a booky Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the booky's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's biggest competitors, and there are no other players in the audience either want to see secure a European victory as the sun descends over the Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everybody prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
However, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson slid easily up with Sergio Garcia, the morning fourballs hero, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish lay so far behind that they did not have nubjeshan to take the lead again.
But on Sunday there is no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes season also showed that the Team USA has missed some people, especially in the United States.
Europe is leading 10–6 at the start of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong lead at the start of the Ryder Cups last day, after completion of Sunday’s fourballs and foursomes matches with 10–6 leaders against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories towards a broken Tiger Woods, and raised their score for the Le Golf National as far as four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, which fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unfortunate side of America in the morning's fourballs and won the 3–1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they didn't get to take back any of the lead.
Jim Fury's side has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rooky to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have scored four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated seamlessly to defeat Woods and the American rook Bryson Dechambeau with even more repressive 5/4.
Woods, who limped through two games on Saturday, flashed to midway, but has now lost 19 of their 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for tomorrow's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and performed a two and one win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything they wanted on this warm day with a light breeze southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won the major three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight of two and ones over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy four and three in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cups has a team ready to pick up after a four-point lead at the start of the single game, but as current holders need only Fear's side to reach a tie to keep the trophy.
But after being next best for two days, it does not seem that they will be able to deliver a counter-attack on Saturday.
North Korea will 'no way' with unilateral disarmament without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened mistrust of the United States and that in no way would it agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation’s annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out ‘significant goodwill measures’ during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test area and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints against Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the ‘nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean war that took place between 1950 and 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first’, and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,’ according to Ri.
«The belief that sanctions can force us to kneel is a wishful dream for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions create further mistrust.’
Ri did not mention the plans for a second match between Kim and Trump as the American leader emphasised before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: ‘If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as fixed as it is.’
However, the tone of Ris speech was very different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to ‘completely destroy’ North Korea last year, Trump stood this year in front of the UN and praised Kim to be brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work still remains, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearly degraded.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this, and said that ‘It has nothing to say about it taking two years, three years or five months’.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that ‘The Security Council’s sanctions still need to be enforced vigorously and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.’
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle the funding of the Pyongyang nuclear and missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had made progress, but only hours after the accusation North Korea accused him of having made “walking demands”.
North Korea committed itself in a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile area and a nuclear weapon plant if the United States did ‘corresponding measures’.
He said Kim had said that these «corresponding measures» he wanted were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by dealing with the growing unculture of chewing through the night with coffee spots as a fuel.
An academic found out that students at the world's best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a talk about the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
‘After the talk, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn’t anyone said this before?’
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains how important it is for good sleep habits to be able to perform academically and sportingly, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for the university's health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for one hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, jogging shoes and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
«We are aware that this will not change the behaviour of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, just as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to chew all night," he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of lack of sleep.
Some sleep should be the ‘secret weapons’ of the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, leading to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study programme before being enrolled in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students set an alarm for when to lie down as well as for when to stand up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can interfere with the rhythm of the day and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga targets Gerrard's men
Rangers probably suffered a loss when Dolly Menga's goal struck Steven Gerrard's team 1–0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted its first win since February's win 4-1 on St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches as manager and since then left his eight points from Ladbroke's Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck at seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to cancel out.
Rangers now fall into the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind the Hibernian at the crossroads.
There may be more trouble in yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown away from the public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased to see how his well-trained team beat the opponents.
Rangers might have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the game when Menga's first watch sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player played the chance.
A long freepark of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game was more hopeful than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was going to have a penitentiary after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers managed only two shots in the first place, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not get any trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the pursuit.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibary with Ryan Kent during the break, and the player shift gave immediate results when the winger sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the away players to play exactly the kind of game they like, while Lithgow and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched management in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before the Lithgow head from the corner.
Rangers' exchanger Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim for a penalty court when he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson went away.
Almanac: inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of the popular culture through the 1950 film «Bels of Coronado», with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What in the world is that?’
Rogers: «It is a geiger counter. It finds radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When using these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.’
Evans: 'Shall it make sound now!'
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave his name to lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
The cells can now ‘see’ a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-injected into the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was given the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cortex she suffered disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ a protein called HER2, which is typically too many cancers, and then reinjecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘ drives the growth of different types of cancers’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, where immune cells were taken from the patient and ‘trained’ to target cancer cells, has been effective in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.

Kanye West was built in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a blasphemous performance in which he praised the American President Donald Trump and said he would stand for election in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee about the charges of sexual assault that Christine Blasey Ford filed.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
West also complained to the public that he heard it in the back room about the choice of headgear.
"They bullied me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said that I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?' he said, saying that he would 'put on the Supermann jacket, because then no one can tell me what to do.
Try to love.’
His comments were made at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked flat, reported Variety, where a staff member said, "The whole studio was dead quiet."
West was brought in as the last little substitute for singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West received the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: «To one of our bravest: TAKE NOTE THAT YOU ARE AGAINST THE IMO MASSES.»
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just «who he is and it is absolutely amazing».
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’, which I believe is cultured and spewing out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was «well formally known as Kanye West».
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg's rapper has had the name Snoop Lion. Of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was once known as Prince.
Aim of the kill test after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been targeted for attempted killing after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The prosecution will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington extends toward "toxic masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordwing Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the machoelt and says such roles in movies often make young men think they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to tackle the problem of "toxic masculinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones-colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very concerned about the theme.
‘It worries me a lot at the moment — where did the masculinity go wrong?’ he said.
‘How have we raised men in view of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that TV could have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" because of the strong masculine roles.
He continued: "What is innate and what is approachable?
What is conveyed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel like they have to cultivate this particular side of being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions in our time -- how can we change that?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any forerunner or successor of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and says he is «completed with battlefields and horses».
From November, Kit will play the leading role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a loner.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so something good came out of it – my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrette, in which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of a total of 14 % in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health representative.
Around 40000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, marking a change from the previous one.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by transmission.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women.
Much of the disease infection is due to inadequate sex protection in these conditions.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised public access to HIV medicine as part of a response to the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects leaking data on Republican senators, sneezing of «hazardous lies» and «conspiracy theories»
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected the charges on Saturday that members of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The democracy of Los Angeles, insured by the claims, was made by ‘ultra-conservative’ commentators and websites.
‘Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies’, said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the web Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to the Waters office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded accusation is completely false and a direct lie’ continued Waters.
‘The members of my staff – who have been compromised by their identities, personal data and security as a result of these dishonest and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unwarranted accusation is completely false and a direct lie’.
Waters' opinion was quickly criticized online, among others by the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They can't go in defense.
You must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They have to act calmly and calmly.
Fleischer compared the reaction of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being overly aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intermediate choices, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great – if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her opinion, Waters said that her office had notified the relevant authorities and the police of these false accusations.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed’, she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff’.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British sloping eye and it seems to be relevant for this revival of the parody franchise Johnny English action comedy – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and reborn in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self-satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we are becoming the nation's new exporter?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and his rubber face has been renewed his license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking cinema.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a demon Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who makes one single note of the musical feature of the fire truck theme during the opening ceremony at the Olympics in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role that Atkinson played in the long forgotten television ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's a great moment in the latest Johnny English game.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades slit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to justice, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely redundant, especially now that the “serious” brands 007 and Mission Impossible have comedy entries away.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and to me Johnny English's barrels are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film loops in Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of the watchkeeping agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a prime minister, a pompous and dejected figure who's already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this kind of Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform us that since every active spy has been revealed, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbed establishment, but provides unofficial teaching in secret intelligence.
English is caught back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, tormented helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, split with a submarine commander, a hysterical super-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and the Robin-style of messing everything up on mission for the Queen is back, where they confront with Olga Kurylenko the fantastic five-fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the ludicrous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey with far-sighted side run: disguised as waiters, they put the guys at a grueling French restaurant. They create chaos while hiding on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get to know him in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so lovable and noisy it is so much like children's TV with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I could only think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they plan to let the British work four-day weeks, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will assess a radical plan that will give Britain four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The lot will obviously require managers to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an additional day of the week off.
This will result in a three-day weekend for employees, while at the same time they will receive the same pay.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day week so that employees can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the desire of the party to let the pendulum swing for the benefit of the workers – in addition to the overall industrial strategy of the party’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day weeks during the campaign before the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesperson said, ‘A four-day week is not the party’s policy, and is not something that is judged by the party’.
Financial spokesman for the Labour, John McDonnell, last week used the Labour Conference to elaborate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘profits’ of public service providers.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water companies are at risk of not regaining the entire shareholding because a Labour government can make ‘deductions’ on the basis of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the boards of directors and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh might change their mind
The FBI review of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question as to whether the Agency's findings may cause some Republican senators to change their minds.
In an interview that was sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham to reveal something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, hesitant, unambiguous».
However, Graham's voice seems to have been stoned.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and in that case it had to be an eye-catching discovery," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday, New York is the host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission to eradicate the world's poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now within its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to stream to the great Central Park lawn, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by getting more people to work actively against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or ‘actions’, such as voluntary work, e-mail to a world leader, pick up a phone or other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when there is now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of making people fight for change, or just another case of so-called ‘krystivism’ - that people feel they are making a big contribution by signing a signature campaign online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million ‘actions’ from their trailers, with a variety of objectives.
They say that these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom to ‘help children exploit their full potential’, and promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eradicate misnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens as you, we can make social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history’, said Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional measures.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, ‘what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?’
Global citizens replied: ‘It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as the important civil rights and anti-a party movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we stand closer together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as a ‘blocked’ to prevent Russian energy export - the Minister of the Interior
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to the navy in order to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when they operate after an invitation from the legal government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
‘I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe’, he should have said.
And according to the spokesperson, there's always ways and means to deal with this.
‘The United States has the ability to ensure through the sea that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block energy from reaching the market’ he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at the event that was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit that profile itself as ‘energy consumers’ voice in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far on the way alike.
‘The economic alternative towards Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The opinions came after the Trump administration had been on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the cheapest option for European consumers.
Employees of the Trump administration, including the President himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European Gas Line 2, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is going to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery resistance to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
‘I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier’, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with resistance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
The German industry’s leading organisation, BDI, has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have major problems with third countries interfering in our energy supply’, said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" on his presidential candidate for 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" whether she would act as a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
At a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would remain silent.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaky government, and it includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
«After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to present myself as a presidential candidate».
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he ‘led the country in the wrong direction’.
"I'm worried as far as the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI check before voting."
However, an opinion poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should remain silent in 2020.
58% of 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be silent, according to a poll of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidateship in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
The bid said he would decide officially by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palin's PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after working in Sept.
He was arrested and targeted for a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"That my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have in common with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest ‘the elephant in space’ and said of the son and other war veterans: ‘They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldier comrades and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country’.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and aimed for domestic violence on a woman, dealing with a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police.
18 Länder and D.C. support the testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support legal testing of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum for victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 Länder and D.C. provided a briefing from amicus curiae (a friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union brought against the federal police in August has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent sons of the gang’ abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the appeal court for immigrants who gave undocumented immigrants as refugees from domestic violence permission to apply for asylum.
State Attorney Karl Racine, District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy «is disregarded many decades of state, federal and international law».
‘Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such prohibition is contrary to that principle’ said the Amicus curiae briefing.
The lawyers further argued in the briefing that the policy that refused immigrants access harms the American economy and says that it is highly likely that they will become entrepreneurs and ‘contribute to the necessary labour’.
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and mob violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their country of origin for persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view’, said the June 11th Policy Communication.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems — even all the serious problems — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the death tolls are doubled in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It was very exciting," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
«All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
Clean water is defective’.
You could see residents who came to ruined homes and easily through damaged assets in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which were injured in the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of them were injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sitting outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftershocks.
He gets tears in his eyes when he retells how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves in safety.
I was hugged by the wall that crashed, I think," told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘travaging’ by ‘propaganda ads’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to Wednesday to the annex China Daily paid to move into Des Moines Register — the most selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US Congressional elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the election in the United States marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials, according to Reuters.
It is quite normal for foreign authorities to use advertisements to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has led to rounds of new customs duties on each other's imports.
China's early trade war criminal duty was to hit export companies in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, reporting Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reading in the Sunday's Des Moines Register: "China is now stepping up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
‘By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities are taking advantage of the freedom of expression and the open press that we enjoy in America to post a paid advertisement into Des Moines Register,’ Branstad wrote.
«As a contrast – at the abiscist on the street here in Beijing, you don't find many dissenting opinions and don't experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China's problematic economic course, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,» he wrote.
He added: ‘one of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish’ his article, even though he did not inform what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away women's voters before the Kavanaugh façade intermediate choice, warning analysts
As many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received multiple charges of sexual assault targeting himself, analysts warn that they will have a counter-reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI review in the last second would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events – they will not forget it tomorrow and not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang 'November is coming!' while they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to go further with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women insecure voters in the suburbs and younger ones choose between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote even if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford's public testimony that gave a detailed description of the charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts thought it would be a counter-reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
‘This has become a blissful root of the Republican Party’, said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not only about the committee’s vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being deployed – it’s also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have dealt with it,” pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priority’s United States, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided over who they should believe in in the cold water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of those asked were entirely or quite convinced of Ford's testimony, while 35% said they were totally or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said that they were quite or totally convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his diploma, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's play, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh in drunken state was violating her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitalia to her while they were at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web author plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose is ‘world domination’.
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses Solid technology to let people create their own ‘personal online repository’ or a POD.
It may include contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all are available on one browser at a time.
What's unique about the online personal repository is that it's up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should provide resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some leased-in developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria Cross receivers from World War I
The only priest in the English church who was awarded a Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann were awarded the honour on 29 September 1918 at the Battle of Bellenglishe and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military distinction.
A memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's winning prize.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under heavy protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he rushed toward the shot line and directed the line ‘big towards’ forward before storming a field cannon manually and knocked out three of the departments.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only one month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the corps of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to play a role in the parade”, adding: “The bravery of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people”.
MMA fans were up all night watching the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to see the densely packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main game.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were sitting there munching when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed by having stayed awake until early morning to see the fight.
A trailer described on Twitter the transition to the children’s programme as ‘a sort of sick joke’.
‘It is government regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m., so they had to turn them over to children’s programmes’, said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice-president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the shipment.
"Peppa pig, yes!";
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the rematch," said Coker.
«But it is 6:00 in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe with-- when we put over, there were many texts going back and forth, and they weren't exactly of the friendly sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government thing.
I can promise you that this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five matches – which we usually send – and we tried to stretch far for the fans, but tipped over.
There is an unfortunate situation’.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a inferiority feeling toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until high school that he realized he wasn't like others.
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for the homofiles' rights to give others ‘hope’.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual programme manager for the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone for a few months because of illness.
Daley appeared to be a little lost on Laverna's first mission and said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, it is these feelings of being inferior and different that have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a highly-profile LGBT ambassador, using his participation in this year's Commonwealth deliberations in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he stands out because he feels lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others “hope”.
The three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man -- filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you're going through so much at that young age" -- he participated in his first OL when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was tough to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “full perspective” had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
‘You know what, there are bigger things than the gold medal in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets for London in 2012 – since he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed about all my life – to plunge in front of a home audience under the Olympics, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - who meant a lot to him in the uphill run before the Olympics and who still gives him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on the BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Moist Mickelson taken out for the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to get in shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12th time, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Fury before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, it five times the major winner divides the day between being a cheerleader and working with his game in the rank, hoping to straighten out what's creeping.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of his career and is not in perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough area is constantly punishing wild blows.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, the British Open-master Francesco Molinari himself, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Fear expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers earlier, and this week.
I guess I didn't see him playing two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven drawdowns, but Fryk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny and likes to do business with others. He's a great guy to have in the storeroom," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying to get to him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game.
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant management at the entrance of the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but won the victory with the lowest possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else on it that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golfers in the world.
Bear is delighted with how his players have made it on the tough golf course and adds: "I couldn't do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that are at the center, and it's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer is tested to the full.
That's the message you have to convey to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Fury will try to get their players to deliver better individually than they did as partners.
Fear himself has been on both sides of the major upheavals last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the ‘Miracle at Medinah’.
I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had met with his players at the entrance of the last day.
«We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle games.
We arrange our setup then and send out the people the way we feel.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the game sequence.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjorn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed once again
German Navy's latest frigate would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the cold war days, but it will not happen until next year's earliest due to failure systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the driver’s ship of the brand new frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered completely back in 2007 will replace the old frigates in the Bremen class.
They have been agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to use the latest frigates for up to two years away from home port.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – they were told to give Germany strength at sea – will already be out of date before they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of important ‘software and hardware defects’ that made the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also discovered that the ship has enormous overweight, which reduces performance and limits the marine's ability to perform upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag of the entire project — including crew training — has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine strength is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the German Defence Committee, confirmed that the marine is actually ‘empty for usable ships’.
The official said the problem has escalated over time because old ships were out of service, but there was no new vessel.
He regrets that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of the bats
New research carried out by a country in the Scottish Highlands will reveal how bats use the landscape in the hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help to design future conservation measures.
The study for researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown-and-water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located at important locations around the property to track seasonal bat activity.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analyses of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the bats and the species that do.
A habitat map and a report will then be prepared to provide a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will form part of the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the installation of pastures and the best management of the forest for bats and other associated species.
The bat population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction affecting breeding grounds and habitat restriction.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials and attacks from Huskats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes for catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation to find insects and roadblocks when they fly.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have 10 competent experts who regularly conduct studies, breeding sites and rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only own bat reserve at Threave Landingdom in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threeve we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
«We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and by other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He underlines the importance of monitoring the bats before carrying out maintenance on a property since the accidental destruction of a single breeding site could kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their breeding grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the audience to help with the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we just don't know how the populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers will sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape charges against him as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want fame’ by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of rapeing an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying her 375,000 dollars afterwards for keeping close to the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news," says five times winner of the Gold Ball into the camera.
‘They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," adds the footballer with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called 'an unacceptable manufacture of suspicions in the private sphere', according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the footballer will claim compensation for ‘reputal damage to an extent equivalent to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious privacy violations in recent years’.
The alleged event shall have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was ‘99 % a good man’ that was failed by the ‘one percent’.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later they agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was «incarcerated for revenge» and was also concerned about «being publicly hanged».
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to set the deal aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom ‘will mourn forever’ about losing car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if they lose their world leadership in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘anxious’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any Brexit without agreement could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant — producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis — produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will, in my view, experience that production at our factory is halting’, said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement about how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're going to shut down the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is about what car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘order as required’ and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made on demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, which the industry says can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's stock at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May’s Brexit plan for further links with the EU is ‘presist designed to avoid such border controls’.
"We need an agreement; we want to get the best agreement that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
‘The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped but warned that increased costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and subsequently lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are becoming increasingly concerned: «My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back».
One spokesperson from the government said: ‘We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU’.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again," says the White House.
Donald Trump's fateful meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can be 'subjected one more week' while the battle around Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Trump assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of judicial activity by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Minister of Justice or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been raging during the speculations in Washington for many months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the talks with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that it was about to withdraw voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he 'would preferably let go' of kicking Rosenstein, but then the meeting was subjected to avoiding that it collided with the Senate Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI review of charges against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On a question about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set. It could be this week, but I knew it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Software manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to a reluctance to the ‘self-righteousness’ of the TV reporters, even though she added, ‘I do not disagree with their self-righteousness’.
She then suggested that the contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
‘The Bureau has more questions than any previous presidents,’ she said, adding without providing evidence, ‘We have looked at the figures’.
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but ‘if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it done often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when visiting important people.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week the president showed the possible reason, when he made a solo run and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS (State Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish MP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applying for a residence and work permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: ‘Disclosure negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I will therefore repeat now how highly I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely their home and we hope you will stay here».
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went through an emergency operation after having a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodore, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessee newspaper.
Tennessee States' main coach, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and took him back for further investigation.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘the type/size of the damage is not yet available’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is inside his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five strikes Saturday before he finished the game, which gives a total of 18 strokes for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. According to new Tory plans, the extra money will be used to help the homeless
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters
The document fee increase will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s plan of attracting young people with the promise to offer more reasonable housing and to target high-income groups.
The application for documents will be made to persons and enterprises that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government’s efforts to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which is in addition to the current document fee, including the higher rate imposed two years ago on housing number two and housing purchase for rent – can be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who mostly live outside the country.
The new policy only comes weeks after Boris Johnson made proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own homes.
He accused large construction companies of keeping housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject allowances on reasonable housing in order to resolve the United Kingdom’s ‘disgraceful housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an eye-catching array of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unfounded discards.
He also wants to give local government greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our degraded housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and also foreign-based companies, to buy dwellings as it is too hard-working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and the unworthy situation of the homeless remains».
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old shot is over the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
«But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that withdraws me.
That possibility, however, would only come if I succeeded in the club.’
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not anxious to succeed such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured as to whether I can get the club back to the Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the management for three years, after a period of assistant director at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' training staff.
Then he helped Alloa to get back from the downfall to the third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of the downfall to win the championship title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did under the playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
«It was likely a real roadblock», he is remembered when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income from it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but management feels absolutely right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do. It feels like the most comfortable I have known throughout my adult life.»

Perfect time for a pint is 17.30 on Saturdays, showing survey
The heat wave of summer has boosted the income of the hard-pressed pubs in the United Kingdom, but has brought more pressure to bear on the restaurant chains.
Publics and bars experienced an increase in turnover of 2.7 % in July — while revenue for restaurants fell 4.8 %, showing figures.
Peter Martin, a business consultant, CGA, who summarized the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long participation in the World Cup led July to follow a similar pattern as the previous month of June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 % in restaurant turnover in June only worsened in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than the restaurants went down.
Pubs with food served also had difficulty with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for the Rastaurant drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6,6 % that month, with food serving falling by 3 %’.
Paul Newman, analyst from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: «These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting and social events are still the main factors in external trade.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a 4.8% annual-on-year drop will be particularly painful at the top of current cost pressures.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a long-lasting breathing room».
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the slowdown in the roll-out of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of £9 billion, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One of five children — some are only 11 years old — has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, showing research
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed pages of ‘fake Insta’.
The news has increased the concerns about sharing sexual content.
20 % of the students said they have a main account that they show their parents.
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — create accounts on social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in ‘fake Insta’ accounts — a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content is shared.
20 % of the students said they had an innocent ‘principal’ account that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to ‘rape me’.
The research, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Director's Conference (HMC) for private schools, revealed that 40 % of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's scary that so many young people are tempted to set up websites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the librarians in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as the board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-performing role in the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated recreational trainer, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to gain insight into her extensive experience at international level over the last ten years.
‘Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and worldwide recreational environment, and we are sure that recreational practitioners in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to act as a voice for recreational athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guiding sports in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I got a blow.
I couldn't go.
The games said that only time will show if I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm really good again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!’
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows splits opinion on the web
A breast pump company has split opinion online with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be ‘the world’s first silent chest pump worn tightly against the body’, Elvie, the technology-based consumer goods company, published a fresh and fluent, music-video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom of the new pump giving active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a bar full of loud and cower to a song with, among other things, the following text: «Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see any tail» and «In case you didn't understand it, this isn't the jur, it's my puppies».
The choir continues: «Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls».
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has got mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the "crucifixes" in the dairy rib.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be pregnant and fed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump is well-placed in a breast bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: ‘Appreciably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hey, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?’
Another added: ‘For a failed advertisement’.
Others defend the ad. One woman admitted that she thinks the song is ‘unbelievably funny’.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another comment: ‘This is a funny ad directed at mothers as pumps (often at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that celebrates or condemns the daisy.’
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely stationary, has no wiring or hoses and is well placed in a breast-fed bra, so that women have the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to light up breast pumping and all the challenges, while, in an entertaining and recognizable way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in all secret
The number of children arrested by migrants has been stable even though the monthly cross-border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children among supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to be a supporter of lonely minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 % of the arrested persons did not previously have a criminal record.
‘Nearly 80 % of the persons who are either support players or members of the household of support players are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep following these people," says Albence.
The officers try to deal with the children more quickly and introduced new rules which require that some of them meet in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days that were the previous standard, according to the reception workers.
Many will be produced through videoconferencing instead of attending in person to conduct their case on residence permits for an immigration judge.
Those assessed as unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to the reception workers and reports that have emerged in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility like Tornillo, where children who are struggling are more easily overlooked because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends may intensify traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now within its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Minister of State, said that the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil under the cover of combating terrorism and ‘will be treated thereafter’.
‘They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally’ he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the ‘war on terror is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and millions are fleeing.
He said that Damascus will continue to ‘bring this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories’ both for terrorist groups and ‘all foreign presence’.
The United States has around 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘certain Western countries’ of ‘precipitating irrational flight’ that causes the refugees to stay away.
"We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what is really a purely humanitarian situation’.
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defensive position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political talks.
The Russian/Turkish agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, as ‘will be exterminated’.
UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes he can soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for re-election.
Moualem put in place the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the Panel should be limited to the review of the Articles of the present Constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Timer
After that logic, Trump would have won re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, national law and scandals will put an end to the presidency before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be ‘the most dramatic conclusion of a presidency ever!’
At the moment, there is no sign of rightness.
Since 2014, viewers have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked cable ratings with a total of 3.5 million viewers in big news evenings.
‘This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything’, said Neal Baer, Programme Manager of ABC’s “Designed Survivor” drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedy maker and author of ‘Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club’, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told me he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in chaos.
Of course – unlike anything else on TV – the actions taking place in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Announcement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an enlightened person when you sit for six hours to follow a panel of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep dive in background material" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with an ostrich value of $15,000 (a garment speckled with hybris," said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trump's, eh..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
‘Some of what he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night’, said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about Trump’s varying role crew and daily twisting on the plot (crimes with NFL, shame Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, otherwise you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27°C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he lived in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't tear himself loose, not when Brett Kavanaugh meets the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said that this is the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right."

External cash flows into the regular intermediate choices of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flow of money after a conversion of a Congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly developed Pittsburg suburb stands with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in an additional election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who at the moment represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the electoral districts of the Republican favor.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive campaign funding race between the main party funding groups, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a closely followed addition election for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small leadership.
USA Considered sanctions against El Salvador for support to China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team to Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the American diplomats of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions to cease recognising Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the official of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the criminal measures were only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and death rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials exposed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance of the administration attaching the assembly, said the diplomat.
And the three American broadcasts returned calmly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the assumption of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
History Learn
The next nail in the chest can be Special Counsellor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible prevention of legal proceedings, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also in the process of extending the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperates with Russia in interference with our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held responsible in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again and perhaps finally a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's case is inevitable – nor for his counterparts in Europe.
We all have to be selected on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938 German officers stood ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are facing several of these tipping points now.
What do we do if Trump kicks Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret rejections of the president and wondered that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' presentation is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recently launched FBI review of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible prosecutions and dishonest testimonies?
And above all, will we vote under the middle election of a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the candles on the table with the crosshairs.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistically before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that victory over the Austrians after the impressive drawdown in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee-catchered midfielder Graham Dorrans in making his first appearance for the season in the drawdown game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard to get to bigger things.
"That was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nodded in at the end, but the draw was probably a good result.
They were probably better at first, and we got out in the second round and we were the best team.
On Thursday there will probably be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with the home audience in my back, I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team's good and the guys are good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, add the last season behind us and get it to."
Women lose sleep at night because of the fear of pension savings
Although the study participants had a clear sense of how they wanted to be taken care of, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to the spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they were talking to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation,’ said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare the family to give you care if you don't tell them what you want in advance.
Discussions with the adviser and the family where and how care should be provided.
Bring your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover those costs or self-insurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Develop your legal documents: Clear legal issues immediately.
Get a health authority in place by appointing a person you have trusted to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your finances.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot make them yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write the details in an overview so you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake – who’s the doctors?” asked Martin.
‘What medicines do you need?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Keep that overview in place’.
Man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he was on his way home after an outing.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Policemen described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an ‘unmotivated action’.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the deaths are expected to rise.
The communication is inoperative and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the force 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in northwestern Sulawesi Island.
The county, an administrative region below the provincial level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency services.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Age in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north of Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that struck inwards the south coast.
2009: A 7,6 earthquake occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while the people were reminded of the kings of the mortal earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by coincidental buildings.
2018: Violent earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused several thousand tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, colliding with a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he must have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged infringement.
Palin is being held in custody in Mat-Su custody and is being arrested for an unsecured bond worth $500, KTUU reported.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he asked himself the guilt question, reported the network.
Palin is confronted with three Class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined for $25,000.
He has also been charged with a crime of class B, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time it has been made aim towards Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being conducted in Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was targeted for domestic violence, dealing with the report on domestic violence and to hold a weapon while he was intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His boyfriend claimed that he slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after attaching her son’s violent behaviour to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strong 7.5 Earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just at central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social media showing the outbreak.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered inward across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been practiced in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he meaded down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “wildly” and deliberately caused serious body damage, according to notice of intent to seek the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point appeal, including eight sentences for killing in connection with money extortion, in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecution authorities in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and wreckage of the vehicle.
The attack required ‘significant planning and deliberate’, said the actor, who described the way Saipov performed it as ‘hesitant, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, property creations and losses for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, stating the warning of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York led a case that could give the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of having murdered two drug sellers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on the mobile phone, according to the sightings.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the appeal on 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were «obviously disappointed» at the prosecution's decision.
‘We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession and life span in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the traumas of these events for all involved’ said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be given responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilize the people’s army’ today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should be given the "feeling pressure" of the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the protestors in Birmingham that the United Kingdom ‘would have been wiped out’ now if Farage were Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile his deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on track against attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told the "Outcome" protesters in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and that he should have been responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to be in charge of Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When he was about to explain his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country».
Bone dismissed claims that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told the reporters: "I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public; the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who traverse the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening».
In a direct message to May, she added, ‘Ministers of State retain the job when they keep their promises’.
Farage stated that politicians would be ‘feeling pressure’ if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is about the trust between us – the people – and the politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: «I want you to make our politicians, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
While marching through Birmingham, Remainers had a two-hour political gathering in the center of town.
A small amount of activists fanned with Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app at the start of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, he added.
‘It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers seriously to be a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously to stand as Presidential candidate" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts democrat talked about the future during a town hall meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elected the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice President of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been in the middle of speculation about whether she's going to stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the voters, who have used the town hall format since Trump became president.
One participant asked her if she was planning to stand as a presidential candidate.
Warren said it's time that "women come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The Baton Rouge police in Los Angeles reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting incident that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University early Friday.
‘Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it’, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the spot and carried his weapons. He admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a stand-up and held by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two-metre-high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season, his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sets out against the world championship title after Stallordre gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's stables would play a major role during the course.
From Pole Bottas got a good start and swept almost Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and let Hamilton continue to run in the rear part of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some push with the wheels which made the Ferrari-driver reluctantly let the inside be free after a double passage to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led in large parts of the race while he was lying on the wheels trying to get to a quick finish and captain Kimi Raikkonen who was lying as number four.
He finally entered the depot on round 44, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight laps and the Raikkonen took fourth place.
It is a difficult day because Valterie did a fabulous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fabulous job to get a good two-pan," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein during a Saturday political event for her insistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not refer directly to Ford's testimonies before the Senate Committee on Justice. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are 'bad, bad and false'.
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and bad and talking false," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, "Oh, I haven't done that.
I have not done so.»
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you been playing?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- 'Oh, oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I have not licked.»
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we...no, we didn't play," he added, emphasizing the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't play her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the president, who commented during the party event on Saturday evening: "I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own ends.
‘They have decided to take power back with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two goals for Giants versus Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-dimensional management via shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownnie settled for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season of Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday evening.
It was the third session of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford put up the game when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
In what became a hectic period of opening, Sullivan led the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt put up to Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants had the management at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard compensated once again with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownnie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the game late in the second round, and he secured the victory with the team's fives halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hoarded as soon as he died and assured that an aircraft that had many hundred passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after their colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could safely facilitate.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in a hospital.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that death rates may rise to several thousand, and the country’s disaster response agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
‘The figures are expected to rise further since many corpses are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been able to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, organ spokesman.
Up to six meters high waves have shaved Palu, who will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "All the time you see ambulances picking up the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are humiliated everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: «Indonesian Red Cross is working febrile to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse».
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: ‘I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?’ CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people were killed.
Fly crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after planes crashed into the lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one man is missing, and they reported earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the descending plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they did not have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been transported to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane was bombing the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
'That's a very good thing,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through the waist-deep water to the emergency exit of the descending plane.
He said that the airmen had panic and screams, and that he had a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said seamen who worked nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have been killed in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the last twenty years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities closed the procedure on Saturday in a new lawsuit for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Attorney General, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile transcripts to puzzle the movements of 29-year-olds accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as the phone of Chambers in the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went in the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the actor asked if Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said that he «loyed because my trailer was in Nashville».
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints indicate that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telis deleted the call, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall, as planned, start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the matter to be left to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is socialized hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the singer by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from the origins of political messages to addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make community-loving hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new bloom in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Only a black person?!
New York Children's Caregiver sues couples for termination of «racist» notice
A pediatrician in New York sues a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a misguided message from his mother, who complained that she was ‘even a black person’.
The couple rejects their racism and compares the case with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up with her first working day in 2016.
‘NEWEEEEIEI ENSHORT PERSON’, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, it was an “incomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman who resigned Maurice, claiming that their dismissed child caregiver, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the termination and demands compensation of the amount of $350 per day for the six-month, losji-based scheme she was promised, but without a contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hey, you just don’t,” she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination”.
The couple have turned back the accusations that they are racist and say the cancellation of Maurice was the only right, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something that she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
The comparison of the case with ‘expression’ says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months to term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," added the stockbroker.
While the legal case is going on, the popular court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticise them for their behavior and attitudes.
The publisher of Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to sit in second place when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book of a small bean bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been rejected.
She describes Paddington as a ‘very important family member’ and adds that her father was very proud of the success he achieved in secret.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he was no boastful person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child doing a trick: you're proud of it even though it's really not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself.»
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing the daughter had been rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked so bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the phone from Nad who said she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I'm so happy for you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in the body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, in the certainty that it happened.
I could not howl and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together».
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers – who did not know about the trials she was going through.
"No one knew," she says.
«I looked down all the time and the tears flowed in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with grieving women to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers foals can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 years old when he was hit by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that his son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew him in the smile.
They said that his smile could brighten any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I worry all the time about it becoming a contagion."
Sharon made the cards 'to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself--you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling depressed or depressed or something," she said.
‘A few days before Christmas we noticed the changed mood.
On Christmas 1st, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas presents, they didn't get eye contact or anything."
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they must fight through it: "It tears up a big hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts investigating
‘I thought that if we could get some of what he asked for – a time- and scale-limited investigation – we might reach a certain consensus,’ said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee fell apart along the bounded party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reluctance was due to the timing.
The middle elections are only five weeks away, November 6th – if the Republicans are likely to make it bad, it will be considerably more difficult for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators and run lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and have him in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean divers «falls» under Kim
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-suck, which refers to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection, said there had been 1127 de-hoppings last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher human trafficker prices were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented on it in public.
Most of the deportees from North Korea are subsequently offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights via China, which have the longest border to North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the drop-offs as illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is still technically at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks on the fixed negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
‘Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no possibility that we will settle down unilaterally first’, said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to sit in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called hysterical," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's diploma before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes almost cried and was crying cold when he talked about the family and years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated character drop” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's testimony shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he's predestined against democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh for national law if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress and the FBI the truth, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi suggested that as a democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the interview, Kavanaugh questioned whether or not he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a fair grief, months and years where the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry" Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do you?"
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my supervisor somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And that's what I thought was amazing."
Tears are allowed as an expiration for hares partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs was in a man-dominated office. I started crying with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck of an older woman – a cool boss whom I had always been a little afraid of – who took me to a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
‘They don’t know you’re furious.
They'll think you're bored and happy because they were able to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to cheating on the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of acting as a presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she lay behind with the funding and swore that she would not remain silent if she did not get 2 million dollars.
There was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount, or??" she wonders.
When she gave the speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive money and to now electors instead of delegates, and anger over sexism – that she fell into tears.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls how the press described her.
«You would think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my grave stand?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The openings in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the fight is far from over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by imposing customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The main escalation took place this week with new customs duties on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duties on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, requited every time, now at the latest with a five to ten percent mark on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the US attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Making Washington descend means yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give China a positive long-term score by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
‘In fact, the fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ring-fences in one of the countries is much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before,’ said Abigail Grace, a research colleague who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thought-smack.
Syria ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they're ready for voluntary returns of refugees and appeals for help to repatriate the country, which is razed after more than 7 years of war.
When he spoke in the United Nations National Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism’ he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that hit their everyday lives and their livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
In addition, there are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will take good advantage of help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that there would not be accepted conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe secures the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning Team USA with a final result of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn got the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who broke out during large parts of the tournament, avoided his tea-beats in the water at couple-3 16th holes, and had to see himself turned off by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant at all his rounds and became 1 out of 4 golfers who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got their current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 of the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With a total of eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind it, the Spanish Sergio Garcia tournament became the most winning Europeans over time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't like to cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in his growth," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who has won 14 major titles, just turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
Team United States spent the whole weekend finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Fury declared himself after a disappointing achievement for his troops, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
It was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw up.
The hat of for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and I want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were shutting down."
