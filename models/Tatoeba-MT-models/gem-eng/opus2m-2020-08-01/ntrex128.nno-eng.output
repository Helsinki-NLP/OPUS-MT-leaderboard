Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to change the name of the assembly member or AM (member of the Assembly) to a member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction was due to plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament National Assembly.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour said that his group is concerned by your ‘MWP rims on Twp and Pwp’
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, 'twp' means foolish and 'pwp' means beesj.
A member of the Plaid party said that the group ‘not satisfied’ and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group has an 'open mind' when it comes to renaming, but added that MWP is not far from the word 'muppet'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is not dissimilar to the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The national assembly’s delegation, which is now writing legislative proposals to introduce the name change, said: ‘The final decision as to which members of the national Parliament should be named will, of course, be up to members themselves.’
A Welsh official 2017 ruling gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals which showed great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of national parliamentarians, the delegation preferred Welsh MPs or WMP, while the MWP elections received the most support during the public hearing.
National assembly members have apparently come up with other suggestions, but the struggle to become a few has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main piece of work.
The legislation of the reforms includes other changes to the way in which the delegation works, including rules on disqualification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the assembly will be able to vote on their names when they debate the bill.
Macedonas are fighting in popular defense to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote to change their country’s name to ‘North Macedonia Republic’.
The referendum was determined to resolve a conflict that has taken place for many decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the People's Questionnaire on the change of name, said he's going to look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price of becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin stop while the churches of Harlem, New York, are strutting
"The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Today there are none of the parts.’
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
'People socialise in other ways now,' he said.
‘Bars are no longer stovered in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
When it comes to the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders believe, ‘and sooner or later, they are back where they started.’
He added that churches can be replaced by condominiums filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those buying apartments in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is the day when all the churches are shut down, because it is not likely that these people moving into the apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist group moved out in the 1930s.
A black socket that had announced in the vicinity, moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black sock led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the store in 125th Street, a main manager in Harlem where the owners were opposed to adding or promoting the black.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild him, they also ordered a new videotape.
Pastor David Johnson, son of the Johnson senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the bell “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the video game in July called it something else: ‘Ein Kultursteuer’ and ‘Ein historische Instrument ein versicht versicht versamment ’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first world bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger bellplay in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said Saint Martin could not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of whom have been added by the leaders of the lay people in the church, and others of the episcopal episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which is the leader of the parishioners, wrote to the Diocese of the Bishops in July with concern that the episcopal deity "would ask the sacristy to pay," even though the sacristy was not involved in the episcopal deity's addition of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained about the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old damage to sharks during hummar dives in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he dives for hummingbirds in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Measured her just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard that good calls for help. He paddled away to good with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only good was enthusiastic about having caught a hummar, before he realized that good yelled «whatever bit me!
Noko bit me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," said Hammel, observing when he reached good.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The good was picked up by the air ambulance and taken to Rady's hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's uncertain what kind of shark it was like attacking good.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that good got serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of shark in the area, but most are not likely to be dangerous.
Butikkjeda Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British retail chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's beauty product and offer storm gas interests in the store.
As part of an investment in the United Kingdom's beauty market, worth £2.8 billion and continuing to grow as fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's test is to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more shops if there's a success.
The investment in beauty product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said that they should double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They're going to give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand, like in Boots stores.
The store also has to relaunch its own makeup boutique and make most of the products vegan, which should attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the hall of his perfumes in two of Sainsbury's shops. The first open in Croydon, London, last week, and the second open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online action and a shift towards buying small quantities of food every day from local retail stores mean that large retail chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, the administrative tenant in Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like storm gas, while the retail chains are trying to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain of Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claim that this has increased the food store and so defended the purchase.
The store’s previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacies departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 21st century, but this ended when the parties did not know how to share the profits from pharmacies in the shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacists and Lloyd's own pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an expanded luxury range of skin products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented, "We've changed how the beauty shelves will look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also appointed colleagues with special skills to provide beauty services.
Our trademarks are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "crazy" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from the deal worth £11 million
The star from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is “rapid” after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle label worth £11 million to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their True interior and trademark.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host from the program This Morning, 37, made recent knowledge of Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “rapid” when the golden Holly confessed during a hard meeting on Tuesday at Jones’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly’s new contracts - worth up to £1,5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and addition brand Truly.
The cooperation has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was supposed to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make sure she wasn't going to work with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to relax in one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely on top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday; Truly was so near the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale.’
Experts believe that the decision of this Morning host, one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of heavy investments in the product, from cushions to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has our close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the label Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
Para vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become the M&S Trade Ambassador and shall replace Ant McPartlin who shall host ITV's I'm A Celebrity programme.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Cool conversations, and then we love each other.
He was fooling about the criticism he was going to get from the media to make a comment some might experience as ‘unpresident’ and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his customs voice as a «newspeaker».
"I have not given up anything."
He commented that Kim was interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear program in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the top diplomat from North Korea Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a ‘correspondent response’ from the United States regarding the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he added, continued with sanctions to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of rocket testing, help to free hostages and return the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in relation to relations with Kim.
"It's so easily presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing to the group that stood before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had to flee, no one declared a national state of crisis, needed to obtain international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While the Redd Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to re-add with foreign passports to work in the field.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations are allowed to provide emergency aid.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquakes, the country is not specifically banned from natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they're not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was at berth in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the implementation of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim troops fought in the streets, using machetes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scared Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by scores in 89 minutes on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's target while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before he kicked him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and fell towards the right top corner of the target.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
'I just tried to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq are trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,' said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and dropped the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shook the ball."
Chelsea leased 1-0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he stretched out the city near the midway and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball in the middle lane.
Then he shot it in a nice way and led Hazard into the criminal field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scora with his left foot right past the keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will be playing against Napoli at the Champions League group stage at 15 a.m. on Wednesday in Stadium San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea shall play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 o'clock on Thursday in London.
Number of victims in Indonesia tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, reported the crisis agency in the country early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, as she did on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6 meters high waves, reported the spokesman for the crisis agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

Parliamentary statue of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the «rewriting of history»
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his Puritan followers did during the 17th century Civil War.
But the Cromwell Association describes Crick’s proposal for the removal of the statue as ‘noise’ and ‘an attempt to write about history’.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell League, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be an objective.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was corkly ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's outstanding representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 1800s, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still thought it was worth celebrating."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: «Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a discussion theme in historical debate.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that division.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Homicides attack and kill Chinese pawns
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in south-west China, according to local media reports.
The man, with the surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is prepared to give pigs vaccines on a guard on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin's dead, and discovered that the gate to one of the piggykins was open.
He said that in the bingen there was a large male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilos of pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"Right to my cousin was bloody and ruined," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance camera shows that Yuan came to market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His likeness was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him, did not listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Even if it is rare, such attacks from pigs have happened before.
In 2016, a pig went into action against a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious damage to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 285 - pound [295 kg] pig kept a Welsh farmer trapped between himself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to the CBC News reported that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can sting the animals.
'They just want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Rests of Hurricane Rosa Brings Rain to South West America
As foretold in the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring the rains to North Mexico and south-west America the next few days.
Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 in the Eastern Time Zone in the United States on Sunday, and the Hurricane Center was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa has to move northwards on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure across the Pacific moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to Baja California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous fleas and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of south-west America, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of south-west America; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous fleas may occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It warns against trips in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn canyons into fluttering rivers and lightning and torestorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of more than 1 centimeters is possible, which can create small flutters and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainy city for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region may wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic gets colder, but tropical strips will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the East U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Board Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony to Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who owed him for sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion on the subject continued, with interruptions in the usual television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest newcomers on Friday: a consensus reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that during the next week the FBI will investigate the debts.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional detour, that he's 100 percent sure it doesn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw off on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this figure by finding the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The number was not clear from other channels which showed the right, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also having trouble counting viewers who are looking at the office.
To put this into perspective, there's a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in the second place at 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants cried out after him on the way to a hearing with a jury on Friday.
He stood and saw in the ground for several minutes while the Protestants gasped at him on CNN live.
'I'm right here in front of you,' said one woman.
«Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?»
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office has pronounced itself, and before he went into the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the televised call when the Judiciary Committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to a full Senate and further calculus.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI investigates the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also asked for.
Flake was partly overconfident after talking to her friend, the democrat, and Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not speak to Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May owes critics to ‘play politics’ when it comes to Brexit
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, owes the critics of her plans to leave the EU to ‘play politics’ with future to the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party Conference on September 29, 2018.
In addition to the May interview on the front of the Sunday Times, there is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he undertakes the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to collect each other’s fees is ‘very absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest the suspected Dyteon Simpson for Sims shootinga
The police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), being killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for intentional killing, says Baton Rouge, Louisiana police.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After taking off with Simpson, the police said he admitted to having shot Wayde.
The Simpson deposit was set at $350,000, reports local The Advocate.
The coroner in East Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a head shot that went into the neck.
Baton Rouge police thank the state police in Louisiana for their special forces, the state police's Crime Lab, the police at Southern University and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being “vigilant in achieving justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter tall basketball player awoke in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "tireless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano spews ash out over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Crisis Prevention Centre asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increases in the crater and the centre recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Social media images show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres south-east of the capital, since a 7.1 earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the self-proclaiming
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrations of self-contained rioting with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against themselves one year after hearing about any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while they threw eggs and powder paints that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The merger also broke out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists cried out ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’ while the Protestants cried out ‘Long live Spain’.
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor damage after protests.
The vote is still held in the region and many will still have their own time one year after the October 1 hearing, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most of the selectors were self-explanatory, but there was also a low turnout among those who were against self-contained and boikotta.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the noise and the elected conspiracy started in the region.
Groups who were too self-employed to sleep in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off the stack anyway, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer has the hope of self-employment in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best-eye moments.
I saw my parents crying out joyfully to be able to voice for themselves, but now we are stuck again," he said.
Even if they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are too self-sufficient to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was a mess of politicians on both sides.
"The voltage is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been part of the ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he should be elected to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand still as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the reversal of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested to crash a car into a house on purpose
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years have been arrested for accidentally collapsing into a house several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The event happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance door and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shots give Livingston 1-0-saws over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston Sigars says
Stylish Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experience his second say after 18 matches that train for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shots turned out to be the difference while Gary Holt's side jammed with the Hibernian squared.
Gerrard's side has no victors in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and will play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six victories in a row, and the main coach Holt still hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miles last month.
Livingston Loses Chances of Away
Holt's team should have led long before they scora, and created more problems for the Rangers with the direct play say.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low stakes against goals, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was content to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scora.
Rangers joined a theme park and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the penalty field.
Before then, the Rangers' ball dominated, but saw that the home defense was solid and the keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by the Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passions were sent back and forth into the Livingston penitentiary, while two sentences--after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by one, were waved away.
'Phenonal 'from Livingston Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their game and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has made the shock since he was a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
The Rangers, in contrast, were not motivated.
Still as good as they've been under Gerrard, they were still not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and just cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they're not reaching out anymore.
Erdogan is allowed to mix welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky as they met to have breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have our differences when it comes to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of ‘security reasons’, but many of Erdogan’s supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan -- many of the Kurdish -- also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German state's decision to wish him welcome to the country.
The dual Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who look at him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist died after collision with a car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car in London.
The collision her near crossed at Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeastern London, 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance crew quickly arrived, but the man died on the scene.
The collision occurred only a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off on Children Street, about 1.6 kilometres from today's accident.
The London police reported that they are identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been disconnected and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been invited to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards insurrection
Six prison guards have been injured in an uprising in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
The ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special ‘Tornado’ forces have been obtained to calm down the uprising, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
Guards have been treated for small injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: ‘Special interest rates should calm down the ongoing insurrection in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate power in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may need to be in prison any longer."
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated for injuries, after a prisoner went to the scene.
And last October, special forces had to come to prison to calm down a serious uprising, where prisoners throw billiard bullets at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flame (for the benefit of the drought region)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on its way to Arizona early next week, in the rest of the hurricane Rosa pulls south-west across the desert and creates fear of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings against flooding on Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona and South and East Nevada, south-California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may give rain late Monday.
The Phoenix twitra national weather service that only ‘ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometres within the Arizona border.»
The latest models from the National Hurricane Centre report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the risk of flooding, the calculation from Rosa may be a glacial glare in the dry area.
Although Flaum is a serious concern, this is likely to be a useful area of south-west America that has been drenched.
According to drought monitors in the United States, over 40 per cent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa moves across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, on Sunday morning, Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northwards at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm power, Monday afternoon or evening.
There's going to be a lot of counting in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of flooding.
"A rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 centimeters," reported weather.com.
Rosa will pull northward along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull on up through Arizona and into the south Utah Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the rest of it is much rain in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the American south-west desert," said the National Hurricane Centre.
This calculation is expected to create life-threatening fleas in desert and landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrests for attempted killings
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of killing after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset, England.
The teenage goods were found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night, reports Avon and Somerset police.
The police have encouraged people who can have cell phone records of what happened, to make contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "suffering" under the chorus of "bad and sin" democrats were against him
"The voice of Kavanaugh's judges is a voice against the ruthless and unruly tactics of the Democrats," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered under the choirs of ‘bad and angry’ democrats through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Thursday, and emotionally denied the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually assaulting her several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also bore witness to her debts during her hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"The voice of Kavanaugh's judges is one of the most competent lawyers of our time, a lawyer with no faults in public service," he said to a number of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to speak in intervals in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't say, but I really do," he said.
‘That’s why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the democrats were trying to ‘stand up and block’.
The first important hearing in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place as late as Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia, number of killed increases
At least 384 people are killed, many of them taken by huge waves on the shores, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami ram the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beaches of the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beaches at sunset, and took many people while they ruined everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't go once and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB crisis resolution agency in Jakarta.
«As if the tsunami were not enough in itself, he took cars, tree trunks, houses; he rammed everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb in three to avoid the tsunami and survive that way.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the Emergency Agency shows many ruined buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftertaste continues to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's technology testing and testing agency (BPPT) said that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from nuclear bombs over Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, lying at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Bureau.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found under the remnants of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of destruction could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, the communication is cut," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding and volunteering to the area.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse,' said the Red Cross.
The crisis bureau was criticized on Saturday for not informing us that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves were coming before the time that was announced.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to man down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't verify this video with the first one.
The shivering and tsunami caused power failure and cut communication around Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate the relief.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting to the authorities, but the refugees still need food and other basic needs.
Airports in the city were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
They added the World Vision from Donggala to Palu City, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
While relief organisations are starting work to help the victims of the tsunami, some complain that foreign emergency workers with expertise in crisis management have been refused entry into Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organisations and their agencies cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘There is a crisis at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis,’ we can open up to international emergency aid, but they have not yet updated their status.’
There's another night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those who are still missing hope still on a miracle, but know that such natural disasters won't end well.
On Saturday, a little guy got scared from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was afraid of the remains of a collapsed building, where she had been a doctor prisoner next to the dead mother's for two days.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Monday said that one of the prisoners in the Roa Roa hotel was his students.
"As with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent whatsapp messages to the paraglidare from Palu, who had participated in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a grey square, instead of two blue hooks.
'I think it means the messages didn't come out,' he said.
Twenty set $26 750 from mini bank in Newport, Levenee, USA
On Friday, thieves stole $26 750 from a company worker Brink's in what he was about to fill up a mini bank in Newport, Livee, USA, following a press release from the Newport police.
The employee had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While the worker was busy, 'a man jumped up behind the worker' and stole a bag of money to deliver.
Witnesses observed several suspects while they escaped from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the police in Newport on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper renames to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name--to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: «The creation was previously known as Kanye West.»
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title on his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change of name came just before he would perform on Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled because of "emotional reasons," said the software player.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye -- to reflect on the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who has changed its name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West before, has also changed the style of writing to the name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, soon to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
US should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the US should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the American government expressed themselves on artificial intelligence, although the United States lacked a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"To double the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, as all the other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A doubling in funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence will take place in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book «AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order» this month via the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Managing Director (CEO) of Innovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the US state, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked how time the next competition should be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state," said Lee.
‘It’s not China that takes the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,’ said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have rented excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I thought that before artificial intelligence, doctoral students would have automatic residence permits," he said.
The Chinese Government published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Association finances students at academic institutions, not unlike the American National Science Association and other government organizations, its way of distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre of artificial intelligence, which is supposed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bill on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians smoke in popular defense to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voiced on Sunday in a referendum if they should rename the Republic of Northern Macedonia to resolve a ten-year-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on their territory, and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not speak in the public hearing, and a boycott has raised doubts about the extent to which the public hearing will reach the minimum of 50 percent of the population it needs in order to be valid.
The question of the public opinion is: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and agree to the agreement with Greece?’
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that gained self-reliance after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
‘I’m here today to voice for future to this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the hearing is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the hearing to make it decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds of the time.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voiced, unlike 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voiced.
'I hear for my children, we belong in Europe,' said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a city's chooser, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voiced in Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia in order to change their name and open up to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the People's Liberation in front of the Skopje Parliament, by setting up tents and chairs.
‘We’re for NATO and the EU, but we’re not to change the name of our country,’ said Kavadarkov.
«We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that membership of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment.
‘I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 per cent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after having voiced.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A polling of the previous Monday of Macedonia’s Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the public hearing – which is below the required number.
Another polling of Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent was going to say yes.
In order to close the public hearing, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voice.
If the referendum is not closed, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton Defense and Scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling rejected the Brighton defense that led to the 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, then he scora for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian peak received a midway pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran past three Brighton defense players and reached an open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defenseman, before he ran past several others on the edge of the Brighton penitentiary.
He got past a guard on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
‘Aguero still wears with his feet,’ said the City Trainer Pep Guardiola to reporter.
‘We talked about that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage of the Premier League game.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicks the ball beautifully along the left end of the course to Leroy Sane.
Sane held on to the ball while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before he slipped out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group Phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoils against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff content, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the 'mound' on Sunday towards Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to the 'playoff' for Rockies, as leader with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but looks forward to locking up the first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other layer that most likely plays at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such relationships?'
It is still uncertain who is going to start in the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer might have to ‘pitche’.
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, throw a 'bulpen session' on Thursday and shall 'pitche' normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 "strikeouts" in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump collects voters in West Virginia
The President referred unobtrusively to his first election before the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he was talking about the importance of the Republican voting in the U.S. elections.
«Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't say, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, 'You can see this terrible, horrible group of democrats, you can see that it's happening right now.
And they're overconfident that they're definitely going to take power back, you see how bad they are, how bad they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘oppose and block’.
‘And you can see it based on the last four days,’ he said, ‘and call the Democrats ‘sinty and bad and ugly and dishonest.’
He referred to the senator and democrat Diane Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
You're the one playing papers?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean.
When Momentum activists in my local party voiced to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last one in a row of Labour MPs that's been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of how important it was to run responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders on.
In the convocation for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said ‘we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.’
In the last eight years my Labour MP has had Friday meetings being just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like that, and the promise of "smart" policies has long been forgotten, if it was at all followed.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and each point of view is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a party leader, when colleagues I used to be politically united with the sudden expectation that I would change my mind and agree on matters I would never agree with - whether it was national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, there's nothing to say what I'm saying, I always get fucked on social media and people want me to go off while they criticise central politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the sex discriminating and racist sheiks directed at themselves every day, and who are still professional and do not go off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass politicians.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every mistrust proposal and for every change in the rules of the game, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will like me better.
But that's not why I chose to join the politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still going to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country.
I have never hidden my political opinions, nor in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have doubted what I stand for and which of the current leaders I don't agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit who wants to harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing energy away from asking questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, not only is the message I've addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the constituency, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to feel you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from thinking about you the way I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top of the Scottish rugby
Two seine 'tries' may change the result a little, but there's no doubt that Ayr hastened to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They are now on the top of the pallet as the only invincible layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defenses and ability to take chances that gave the home team and coach theirs, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
'We've been tested in the last matches, and we're still invincible, so I must be naked,' he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr is tinging praise, they were better than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a ‘try’ in 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a ‘conversion’ that put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors lot Melrose collected, and Jason Baggot took an ‘unconverted try’.
Climo got a punishment just before the break, he scora and 'converted' a 'solo try' to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's «try», which was «converted» by Baggot, reduced the slingshot by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott was severely damaged and laid on the rack, and from the restart, Ayr passed through a try from Stafford McDowall, like Climo 'converted'.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an 'unconverted Bruce Colvine try' at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty lineup, scora MacPherson a ‘try’.
Climo ‘converted’ again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong’s ‘box kick’ and sent the ‘flanker’ Gregor Henry away from his fifth ‘try’ team.
The star from the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, in which he writes and plays with the partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last, and it seems as if Krunn is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is Director of A driftstorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the matter, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has suggested that Kläpp would be involved in the successful restaurant industry in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: «The sea is ours.
and the obligation to return to it.»
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict about resources in the 1800s. They long to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court to come on 1 October, after five years of counsel.
‘Bolivia has drifted, calmed and is alone, and of course expects a positive result,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim, and that, after decades of negotiations, Chile will provide an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia -- who was striving to be elected again next year -- has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we'll get back to the Pacific soon," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court is going to let Bolivia have access to the sea -- and that little would have changed themselves if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court’s sentence comes only six months after the last hearing indicates that the case ‘not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have gone a long way from Bolivia's cause, they've done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with his contentious rhetoric, has killed what was of Chile's goodwill, said Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have ‘an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile’ and a chance to ‘put a line at 139 years of disunity and benefit both,’ he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win voices.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,’ he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up on the promises they gave during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pomepo seems to want to start again with his locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subdue itself if the United States persists in sanctions and opposes a possible declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington refuses to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang ending first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical that Pyongyang is serious when it comes to degradation and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the last fashion on the way to a handicraft near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you do not have to search any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headgear in their SS19 collection.
The most impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations straight on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a generous, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the brem that covered the models' heads.
There were also other oversized accessories during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembles diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just forget.
Fashion experts find that the huge hats come for sale in a handy manner near you.
The oversized hats come straight after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 centimeter wide brem that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-trade mark behind the highest impractical hat, which was all over the social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
Beachbag, with the color of burnt orange and frowning the top with a white skin handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus's La Riviera SS19 collection during fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion shops the next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Knowledge
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and joint success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 elephants in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), are working to provide the best services to students and their parents.
The aim of self-employed schools is to provide students with higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular choices in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, his message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his own heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only borrow in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest characteristics for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the elephants who took the lead got A.
The data collected from SCI's 74 member schools shows that 72 percent of students received A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that self-reliant schools in Scotland support forward-looking languages as vital characteristics, which children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages considered as equivalent to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the syllabus to independent schools and other places.
A study carried out by the UK Addition and Properties Selection in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of employers failed to fill settings because of the lack of language skills of the applicants.
For this reason, language in schools is more and more important to guide young people into working life.
With more job opportunities for language skills, these properties are essential in a globalised value.
No matter what kind of career a youth is well, if they have learned a different language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person an advantage in a competitive value.
According to a YouGov study of more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to speak more languages, especially the language used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, for example mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will preside over children and give them the properties they need to be closed, no matter what future impacts.
One cannot deny that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be referred to as ‘international communication properties’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, providing skills and skills for their young people in Scotland.
I'll have a beer faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is soon ahead of fans looking to see LeBron James debuting at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing in the preseason game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's going to play, hasn't been determined yet.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, twittered that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' pre-season schedule.
'I don't need to play for the season at this stage of my career to get me ready,' he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts on a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
That's the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation voice waiting to fill in the vacancy, Trump aims to build support for the next mid-range elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting to be held in November.
How time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump’s West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably take up this week's hearings of the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about the debt of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cab of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum.
This is how President Trump's campaign says that these five collections of the next week are aimed at ‘encouraging volunteers and followers who the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives’, according to Reuters.
‘Control of the Congress is so critical of his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season,’ says a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to the Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening collection can bring support from Ohio and Pennsylvania and take cover from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a raise in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team U.S. shows a fit to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport, but one that the players really believe in, and never more than on competitors like these.
So where would they say that momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there's four, so we take it as a little moment, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and suffers by example.
The guttural screams of the celebration were higher as his round continued, sought an important putt to take the match four all-squao.re when he and Thomas had been down two after two.
His cushion that won the game at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
'You've actually only got to dig deeply and worry about your own fight,' said Spieh.
There are all of these players left.
18 holes to make an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but cute pairs are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
«Moliwood» was the only couple who would not shoot a booky on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
It's the race, and the way their energy seems to float both to and from this noisy, engaging audience, sedentating that they're the players to beat on Sunday, and there wouldn't be any more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talking about European honour is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles in the first nine, rough spanjolen and Swedish into a hole they never got near to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and the way that a strategy can change at a glance.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a considerable lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe Takes 10-6 Leadings in the Ryder Cup Final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a giant Tiger Woods to take their fight so far on the Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side offered to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a mischievous American side tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The U.S. added more resistance to foursomes and won two battles, but they could not capture the subsoil.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an eye-catching weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their opening in four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they turned out so great to beat an exorcist Woods and American rookie Bryson Decambeau with an even more reticent 5 and 4.
Woods, who went through two fights on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who swirled for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes for a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe didn't even get everything they wanted on a nice, inflated day southwest of Paris.
Three times bigger wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a layer has come back from a four-point base and entered singles, even though as an owner, the Furyk side only needs to draw to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks as if a Sunday mot attack will be outside them.
North Korea says that there is no talk of rusting down one side without trust
The Secretary of State of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue to distrust the United States, the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Power that North Korea had taken 'significant measures' to improve the situation in the last year, for example they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We still don't get anything corresponding back from the United States," he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, our national security will not be trusted, and under such circumstances, it is not possible for us to disarm unilaterally first.’
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has presented several complaints about Washington's resistance to a 'phase' approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, where North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his dissatisfaction showed itself significantly by not rejecting unilateral nuclear degradation, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a common feature printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for ‘reduction of nuclear power in the Korean peninsula’ while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to facilitate tough international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The United States insists on ‘reducing nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion, and they oppose even the ‘Declaration of peace’, said Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our mistrust becomes even greater.’
Nothin' about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. president pointed out earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "If the party in this call for the decommissioning of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the degradation of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year's, when he told the F.N. General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the mainland of the United States, after President Trump called Kim a rocketman on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to 'completely destroy' North Korea, boasted of Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place for North Korea to liquidate its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told F.N.’s Security Council on Thursday that ‘the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to be maintained vigorously and without failure until we have the complete, final, verified decommissioning of nuclear weapons.’
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to divert funds into Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the F.N. General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea to come up with “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to disassemble a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US did ‘the corresponding measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was applying for were collateral guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and was moving towards normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough sleep
This year, a new course at Harvard University has helped all the students get more sleep, trying to fight the growing macho culture that is going to study in caffeine all night.
An academic found out that top university students often carelessly when it comes to the most fundamental thing -- how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his battles in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the influence sleep deprivation has on learning.
‘At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this now, at an adult age?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping--something that surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as how important it is to evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, invites participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of the elephants right away.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The culture of daytime pride still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid getting into weight, because lack of sleep put the brain in a state of hunger and make them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having studied at Harvard last year.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start at that high-precision institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm when going to bed, and then when waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock completely, leading to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals bring Gerrard's men downhill
Rangers went on a new defeat on the road when Dolly Menga’s posts sent Steven Gerrard’s outcast side to a 1–0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking forward to taking its first fairy tale on the way, since the 4-1 Triumph of St. Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt Springsaka only Gerrard’s second defeat on 18 battles as leader, and gave eight points, a round under Ladbroke’s leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga struck at seven minutes before half-time, and a ranger statement with a lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on the finish line.
And there may be additional problems in storage for Rangers after the lineer Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head, after an object apparently was thrown from overside.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that feia Ayr entered the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been enthusiastic about the way that the veldril suit his foe took the strangler roof of his opponents on each shift.
Rangers might have had the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midway player failed in his battleship.
A long free-range park from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot a long shot at the retreat.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos certainly felt that he should have had the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judges Steven Thomson waved off the request to the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibary's head and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the players' eyelets, no one can deny that they only lit it because of the 'shoot'.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which held out fun to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard paused with Coulibary with Ryan Kent and changed his mind immediately when the winger made a hole for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed forward to block.
But Livingstone continues to outlist the guest team to play exactly what they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out long shots of long shots.
Holt's team could have increased the lead at the end, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
The Reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: the inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our «Sunday Morning» Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKN ... the day when he who was to be the physicist Johannes Wilhelm «Hans» Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific support beam all the way since then, the Geiger counter was also a support bar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film 'Bells of Coronado', with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What in the world is it?’
Rogers: It is a Geiger counter, which can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you turn on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity of the minerals.’
Evans: ‘Yes, no, no!’
«Hans» Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “see” red cells.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of the treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers, and then reinject it.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learned the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “ drives the growth of several types of cancers, including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ them how they target cancer cells has worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West is starting a Pro-Trump-diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he's hosting the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was piped out in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible achievement in which he praised his US president, Donald Trump, and said he would stand to election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great-caps, he gave the democrats a tiger and repeated his support to Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number together with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star fooled Brett Kavanaugh into testifying in the Senate's judicial selection about the debt of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording to West's tiger was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me behind the scene.
They said don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West said, 'Do you want to see the sunken place?' said he wanted to put on the superman caps, because this means that you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.’»
His comments led to popping out at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with a person who told the publication: «The whole studio was deadly silenced.»
West was brought in as a late replacement for the songwriter Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: ‘To one of the most courageous spirits: TAKE NOTE that you are standing up to the mob’.
But the talk-show hostess Karen Hunter twittered that West «was quite simply just like him and it is absolutely amazing.»
‘But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe embraces and spews out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are, too» added she.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now ‘formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Medrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington goes against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for the sword-winging role of Jon Snow in HBO's chosen medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-player Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "very strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm overconfident that something has gone wrong with the masculinity." he said.
«What have we learned when men grow up, when it concerns the problem we see now?»
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is innate and what is being taught?'
What's learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young guys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he would not do the Game of Thrones sequences or sequences when the series ends in the summer and says he is “completed with battlefields and horses”.
From November, Kit will be playing in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with the wife of Rose to be the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so it gave me my future family and my life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the handsome to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are victims of violence in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ individuals is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have confirmed that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transfers of the pathogens come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectar adds paint information from the GOP senator, it explodes in dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had published personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were pedalised by extreme-right-wing research and web pages.
‘Lies, lies and more contemptible lies’, said Waters in an interview on Twitter.
The published information included information about home addresses and telephone numbers for Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill under a Senate panel hearing about the debt of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters' office and released the information to a member of the Waters' staff, Hill reported.
‘This groundless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie’ continues Waters.
'One of my contributors -- who have got their identity, personal information, and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false claims -- was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless claim is entirely false and an absolute lie."
Questions to Water quickly received criticism on the web, among others from former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she does not have a temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets into debt for something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They do not have to ask questions about the motive for the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by the judges Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent to anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to take over Water's place in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Greatly true," he twittered.
In answer, Waters said that her office had warned "they're the right regulators and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my employees."
Johnny English strikes again - spy tull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexit in all new movies with a British twist, and it seems relevant for this revival of Johnny England's action-comedie spoof-franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire dealing with how open-minded we are become the new export potential of the country?
In any case, the big-mouthed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber facet has for the second time been allowed to renew his right to fuck things up -- his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic book creator for cinematographers in non-English-speaking countries.
He is of course the foolish, secret agent who failed in his bizarre wish to spread some glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple tune to the fire trucks, theme during the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos behind.
There's one or two nice eyes in this last JE escape.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts to physical comedy are on the screen, but the humor is quite weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor is known as being aimed at children instead of being grown up, and to me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's reply is in the person of Bean.
The permanent current regime is now that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the United Kingdom's super-secret web network of spies, which reveals the identities of all agents in the United Kingdom's field, to the dismay of the agent at work -- a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a pompous and warlord figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political inopularity: Emma Thompson does his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
Her intelligence counsellors inform her that when every active spy has been in debt, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a learner of something elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-Type Academy for Spying.
English is being sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunite with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moving over to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiast role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things to become terribly crazy in the Secret Services of the Hennar Majesty is back to full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims to be able to solve Britain's data problem: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin to travel by farce-like game: disguised as waitresses, they put the guys at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself known with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are probably drawn to the last sequence, but as loving and unsimplified as they are, there's a lot of baby TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denied that they were working on a plan for the English to work for a four-day week, but were paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party now assesses a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the company manager will forward savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an extra day off.
Then you could add a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "match" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase employee benefits.
The change in a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the turn of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker, as well as assigning it to its industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
For the moment, however, the ambition is not approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesperson said, 'The four-day week of work is not party politics and it is not assessed by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profits" in rich companies.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in water events cannot recover their entire efforts as a Labour Government could do "reduction" because of perceived misdemeanor.
He has also confirmed plans to add 10 percent of the equity of private sector enterprises, which would receive annual dividends of up to £500, about $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told in the 60 Minutes TV program about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against judges Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of to what extent the Agency found could influence some Republican senators to withdraw its support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in 60 Minutes asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their mind.
Kennedy seems more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Myself, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the earring, I said, I have spoken with the judges Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that statement came out and said, 'Have you done that?'
He was intended, permanently intended, extravagant.’
Graham's voice still seemed to be seen in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," added Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all its names couldn't verify it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York's host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive array of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's large lawn, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to complete a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ as voluntary work; email a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to contribute to raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way of persuading people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called 'krytivism' -- people feel that they're making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens states that it has registered more than 19 million ‘documents’ from its support players, and participated in and pressed for a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies that amount to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group of 390 obligations and notices followed by their actions, including at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that to date the secure funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs who are obliged to ‘help children reach their full potential’; promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
‘With the support of the British government, donors, national government powers and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,’ - told ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5000 actions to require the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, they ask ‘what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?’
Global citizens said: 'It will be a long and difficult road -- some times we will fall and fail.
But as the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will be happy because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a 'blocked' to prevent Russian energy export - internal secretary
Washington may ‘if necessary’ resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zince claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria -- especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government -- is a haven for exploring new energy markets.
‘I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to distribute energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"U.S.A. has this power, with our fleet, to ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as ‘the voice of the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,’ he said, referring to Russia as an ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements made by the Trump administration are intended to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, the Trump administration staff, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘capture’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's eager resistance to the project is driven only for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. hold has withdrawn a setback from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to ‘run hard’ to stand as Presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "considerate look" to stand still as Presidential candidate after the midway election.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider making a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and it includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will carefully consider acting as Presidential Candidate.’
Warren addressed President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he ‘brings this country in the wrong direction’.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been scratched in his criticism by Trump and his Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll issued on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator shouldn't stand as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe investigation.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidate.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with a view to a potential 2020 candidate, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being held in September.
He was arrested and accused of a violent crime in his home on Monday evening.
"Whoever my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds with which our solar data returns," she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest 'the elephant in the room' and said about his son and other war veterans that 'they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back and they wonder if the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military have done for the country exists'.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was responsible for physical power in the home against a woman, for disrupting a report on the power of the home and the possession of a weapon while he was rushing, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. challenge to support new asylum policies
Eighteen States and Districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denied asylum to victims as refugees from re-elected or elected in the world.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts submitted a friend-of-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits in with the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (U.S. Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner ‘and the elected members-sons’ abused her, but American officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of the States supporting Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, who are faced with pervasive problems of domestic violence and violence.
The new American asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration laws, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee the country's empire to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Minister of Justice Karl Racine said in an interview on Friday that the new policy ‘ignores many decades of government, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle,’ said the friend-of-court brief.
Lawyers further argued in the summary that the policy of refusing access to immigrants harms the economy of the United States, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘provide necessary work’.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of refugee abuse and re-election in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who left their country of origin because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,’ said Sessions on 11 June in its policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while death tolls in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It's very exciting," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforts his febrile baby son at an evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
‘Ambulances come every minute with bodies.
Clean water is difficult to find.’
The inhabitants are observed on their way back to their ruined homes, as they search through damaged properties and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals that were devastated by the earthquake, which had a force of 7.5, were flooded.
Some of them injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, sedated outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eye as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, « Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then it was silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador owes China for ‘muggling’ with ‘propaganda ads’
One week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page commercial in an American daily newspaper highlighting the mutual benefits of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador owed to China Beijing to use the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid back in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after debting China to try to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, a debt of China nectar.
Trump's debt that Beijing was trying to get involved in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign government powers to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in rounds of increased taxes on each other's imports.
China's rate of return early in the trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassador to China and the former long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” wrote Branstad in a sentence in Sunday’s Des Moines register, “doubles no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
‘In its communication of propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from America’s dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by posting a paid advertisement in the Des Moines register,’ wrote Branstad.
«In contrast, by the newspaper down the street here in Beijing, you will find distinct voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party «he wrote.
He added that ‘one of China’s most prominent newspapers abstained from the offer to publish’ its article, even though he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans forward female voters lead midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning analysts.
Since many top Republicans are stand-by and defend the Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault debts, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the coming mid-range options.
The senses around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with one voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last blink of an eye for an FBI investigation would be enough to entertain angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
On Friday morning song Protestants «November is coming!» while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
«Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, on the news page.
'People say it's already been high, it's true.
But there can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimonies detailing the claims of sexual assault directed against the adjudicating Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested that a setback be followed if the Republicans press ahead with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused root of GOP," said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It’s not just about the vote of the Committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it,” Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select Democrats, points to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little bit divided over who they should believe in in the cold water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more sidings with the last denominator.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and besides at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witness to the Senate Judicial Committee during the last week's oath that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the dignitary showed her the sexual organs while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web schedules to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a launch that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project for technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to select where the data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is ‘world domination’.
'We have to do it now,' he said about the startup.
‘It’s a historical flash.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online repository or POD.
It may contain contact lists, reminder lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is completely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to all.
For the moment, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In an article on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
'I am unlikely to be optimistic about this next epoch on the web,' said Berners-Lee ti l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The divinity of the only Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrating in its hometown for 100 years.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
He was still killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial was laid off by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic," that the stone would be decommissioned exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 ‘through a very thick shone and under heavy fire from the field and machine gun.’
He later jumped up to the front line, and with the 'greatest gallantry' he led the line forward before he sprang forward with a field gun and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "I know I could never live up to that, but something I'm humble for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honoured to play a role in the parade, and added that "the value of a real whole is shown by the support given by many people."
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've been up all night to see a package of Bellator 206 but you can't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, right in the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald pretending to meet each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had kept awake to the early hours especially for the fight.
A Twitter-based tab described the children’s cartoon as “a kind of sick joke.”
‘It’s public regulation that 6:00 p.m. isn’t owned like that, so they had to switch to the program for the children,’ said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘ Peppa-pig, ‘yes’.
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they're going to work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can find out," said Coker.
"But the clock is six in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it went over, there were a lot of lyrics going back and forth, and everyone wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five matches instead of six -- which we usually do -- and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
That is an unfortunate situation.»
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘underlying’ because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he was growing up feeling worse than everyone because of his sexuality--but that's what motivated him to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the continuing school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he talked out about his gay dishes to give others hope.
He also said to become a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent reporter in the long run showa, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off because of illness.
What could look like a lost in Laverne's first program, Daly said he knew himself 'less than' all the others who grew up because 'it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls.'
He said, "From today, having a sense of feeling less than and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "noco," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gong bronze Olympic medallion has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he knew himself lucky who could live open without distinction and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-gong World Champion said that it was falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference never had a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he went to the first OL of his 14 year old and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and downs.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
«You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Mi Olympic gold medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London in 2012 - when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
"I held hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the Olympic Games in 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed about my whole life--to dive into front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans don't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice -- pride of Heather Small -- who had vibrated with him in the construction of the Olympics and he still gave goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench on the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must turn around to say that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 times, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf games in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within the reach of hoping to correct what is bothering him.
Never the most competent long shots. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with long shots on the throne, the French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly hit.
And if the path itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will meet in the ninth match on Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches they did this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles, get to a hot start, Mickelson's fight can be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
‘He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I saw more, but that was the way it was, and that was how we thought we had to do.
He'll be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, even though Fury said that his closeness added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the hold," he explained.
'I think the younger players had fun playing with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.’
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European Captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last few days' singles of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant journey.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with his nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lease on Valderrama; we had a big lease on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjorn, after he had seen Class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to hire 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you score the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's left over on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Happy about how his players have behaved on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the saying in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual achievements that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you get to be tested full of your capacity as a golfer.
It is the message you need to convey to players; get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, the opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Fear itself has been at both ends of the spin-offs in the great last days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe drew off the 'Miracelet in Medinah'.
"I think of every damn word of it," he said in response to being asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the way into the last day.
«We have 12 important battles tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, as you saw on Medinah.
When the moment comes to pass, put a lot of pressure on the middle fights.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the guys in motion in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow.'
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I believe it covers all the way through," said Bjorn about his choices of singles.
Germany's new warships postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold wartime, but it won't be there until at least next year because of the wrong system and emerging costs, reported local media.
The launch of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the leadership of the split-up of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-avias, who quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plague the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship Maritime Defense ordered back in 2007, replacing the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home level ports.
Nevertheless, continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking ships of war, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be out of date when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware errors’ that made the warship useless if they were placed on a combat mission.
Software errors were particularly important as the ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also appeared that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its performance and limits its fleet to adding future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also be a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from the initial €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that Germany’s fleeting power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet actually 'is nearing the end of a ship competent for distribution'.
The officer said the problem has been built on over time, because old ships were closed, but no replacement vessel was delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Thieves on Secret Life to Bats
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in the pursuit of food.
It is hoped that findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and besides brown Langøra and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in important locations around the property to track flag mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS additions and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calling and the species that do.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural science consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat, natural worlds are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work as the purchase of meadows and how it is best to maintain a level playing field for bats and other associated species.
Flag mouse populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and habitat/buying sites loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments for building materials, and attacks on pet cats.
Flag mice are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, dorm inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Three Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, the home of eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says that property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threeve we have a great area for bats," he said.
«We have old buildings, many winter trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other property will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance in private property, since it is possible that the infinite destruction of a single bus stop could kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps wipe out an entire local population.
Flag mice are peaced and it is illegal to kill, plague or disrupt them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are moving."
Ronaldo rejects the jurisdictional debt in which the lawyer sues the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the electoral debt against him as ‘false news’ and says that people ‘want to emphasize themselves’ by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been responsible for choosing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are ‘false news’.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be familiar with saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good, 'make the player smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have referred to as 'an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for «moral damage in an amount of the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.»
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga moved back to the room of the player, where a claim that he should have chosen her anal, according to the document submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed event and said that he was '99 percent' a 'good guy' and failed 'one percent'.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but was later agreed on a settlement because she felt “feared by retribution” and was concerned about “being public meek.”
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to be traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever undo' losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would undo it forever” if it lost its status as world leader before car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was ‘om’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
'We need an appointment,' said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of frontier delays in the event that a non-agreement with Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what car manufacturers say are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-agreement with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is driven on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruptions at the border that the industry claims can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We must have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4s program.
‘Prove from not only Toyota, but other producers are that we must be able to continue with what has been a very successful set of supply chains.’
Toyota could not tell how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that extra costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
One spokesperson to the government said, ‘We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.’
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-ranking meeting with Vice-Chancellor Rod Rosenstein could be 'pressed back a week' as the fight against the Supreme Court continued nominee Brett Kavanaugh, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Councillor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian valance interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and the potential obstruction of the President's justice.
Korvidt Trump will denounce the general of the prosecutors or not, thus endangering Mueller's self-employed, has been feeding Washington gossip for several months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a loan to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to cancel.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "advanc" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission's hearing how both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full voting by the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There has not been a date set.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters may disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any president has ever done before," she said - quite rightly without providing evidence of the claim. "We have seen numbers."
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but ‘if the pressure gets the chance to ask the president directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do this part, and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when travelling from the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to hold a press conference alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he behaved the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit's fear of EU workers at the NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express appreciation and a wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even if it is less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to addressing the costs of applications that have the status of EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: ‘During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected end of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for you all.
So I'm going to repeat the price I have of the contributions to everyone, no matter what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector and are beneficial to patients and society.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after wearing a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports newspaper The Tennessee.
Chief coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, reported that the damage happened just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in one way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesperson from Tennessee State, WSMV said Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There is no detail on the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five strikers before he was injured in the Saturday fight, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The additional income is to be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the conservatives.
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added for non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom.
State treasury expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May today announces that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who feel a lot, with the promise of offering reasonable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of roaming agents.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago on the number two dwelling and rental properties, may be as much as three percent.
Statskassen expects the decision to take up to £120 million a year.
About 13 per cent of new buildings in London are purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which makes prices higher and entry into the housing market more difficult for first-time buyers.
Many prosperous areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become ‘ ghost cities’ because of the large number of foreign buyers that most of the time are in other countries.
This new policy only comes weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He appealed to a large construction company to keep prices up by getting possession, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances on reasonable housing to fix the United Kingdom's 'burden of housing'.
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-catching suggestions for housing reforms, including controlled rentals and the closing of shows without a reason.
He wants and gives greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Nevertheless, it may not be right for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign companies, to buy dwellings as it is too hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of own housing has gone too far away, and the audacity of being strippers is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his ultimate ambition is to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
The shot (42) slips over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St. Mirren back to the Scottish elite series in the previous season.
‘I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B-land battle, and that's it," said Ross to Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland at Hamden together with my father, and it has always been something that has pulled me back.
That possibility can only come if I have succeeded as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he's previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
«For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong to the Premier League," he said.
'It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only think of myself as successful if I can get the club back there.'
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period of assistant director at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the training equipment of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to get from falling down to the third level, and turned St. Mirren, who was about to move down, into the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says that he knows himself more comfortable now, than he ever did while he was playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was enough a crossroads," he says, "to lead Alloa.
‘I honestly thought it was better for me to be a manager than to be a player.
The rightmost bit out, because I did it well, lighted up well and liked it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're forced to get through every week.
I still notice that when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it seems right to be a manager.
I always want to be a manager, and now I am. It is the most comfortable I have felt in my own body throughout my adult life."
Sunday 30 September, you can right the entire interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
The investigation shows that the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The heat wave of the summer has led to an increase in the ignition of bustling pubs in the United Kingdom, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 per cent in the barn industry - but for the restaurant industry, by 4.8 per cent, statistics show.
Business consultant Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said, "The current sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June when pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder frames.
The 1.8 percent drop in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it much better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food received and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem that people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had gone down by three percent.
Paul Newman, a travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: ‘These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The value, and the impact of an enormous social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the outdoor hall.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still wear out. A 4.8 percent drop in sales will be bad to get at the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-powered operators. The time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a prolonged breathing space.»
The total increase in sales across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the publishing of brand items.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyses results data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and is the industry reference index.
One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Study of 20,000 students on further progress reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'head' profile they show parents
One of five children -- some as young as 11 -- makes profiles on social media that they keep secret from adults.
An investigation of 20,000 elephants in the continuing school revealed a sharp increase in false Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while also having private profiles.
A mother who stumbled over the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "elect me."
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, ‘It is surprising that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the web where parents and teachers can’t find them.’
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of the athletes of the Scottish Judicial Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Friedness as non-administrative director of the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated recreational sportsman in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great possibility for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's civil rights society, and we are sure that freedom in Scotland can benefit from getting her into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can contribute and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its four OL gold and now is a regular guest at BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: «Today it is a month since I was hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was only the time that could tell me if I was going to be okay again, or to what extent.
It has been exhausting work, but I have become quite well again, learned to go again, and today I do flexibility boots!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Internet split opinions on breast pump clamps comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to dairy cows.
In order to mark what is described as ‘the world’s first steady, holding chest pump’, the technology company Elvie dropped a small number of advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump provides mothers who extracted milk.
Four real mothers dance in a tall-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see tails" and, "In case you don't label it, this isn't teasing, it's my puppies."
The reference continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
The advertisement, which has been published on the Facebook page of the company, has, on the other hand, created controversy online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it highlights the horror of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, just that the calves are stolen from them just days after birth," writes one.
Elvie breast pump sit discreetly in a breast bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: «Intelligible enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their kids?"
Another added: ‘For a remote advertisement’.
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seemed to let you be ‘festivities’.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still had a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another comment: ‘This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers like pumps (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the discreet pump packed into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women like pumps say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wiring or pipes, and is discreet inside a breast-fed bra, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: «The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it ignites a volatile and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers that extract milk and dairy cows, we want to put light on breast pumping and challenges attached to it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion show in London, a mother showed up to two on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children move quietly to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant prisons has peaked even if monthly border crossings have remained relatively stable, partly because the strict policy of the Trump administration has made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and receiving a child could threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be forced to submit fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence witnessed the immigration and customs enforcement of Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have anything on its leaflet already.
‘Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue to persecute these people," said Albence.
According to the members of the camp, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. The rules require that some of them now have to go to court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to have the matter tried before an immigration court.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they are developing anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective eruptions or evacuations, they say they are adding to the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same thing.
Speakers say that these concerns are greater in large facilities such as Tornillo.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hate to friends, can intensify trauma that many have already struggled with.
Syria is asking US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is and acts as Deputy Minister of State, said that emerging forces are being illegalized on Syrian soil under the guise of repressing terrorism, and ‘will be treated out of it’.
'They must withdraw immediately and without prejudicing' he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the ‘war on terror is almost over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight a holy battle all the way to all the Syrian territory has been cleansed” for both terrorist groups and “illegal presence of the future.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that warring country.
When talking about refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed some Western countries for having 'spread irrational fear' of the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
‘We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return,’ he said.
‘They are making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major insurgent, has created a possibility to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement averts a large attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the nusa front, who are attached to Al-Qaeda, as "will be exterminated."
The UN mission, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem lays down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee and says that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference.
Why Trump is going to win a term
With that logic, Trump will win the 2020 reelection if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency will end early because of scandals and national law.
It would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!'
At the time of writing, there are no signs that the viewers have lost their lives.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC almost triples its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best transmission time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has a doctor at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of «Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club», has another theory.
She thinks of a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote on Trump.
Why did she ask you that?
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There's entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history coming from Washington can decide future to Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get together again and greet the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further than being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with a "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostriches to $15,000 ("a garment thick of arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's creepy description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it look like a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by Pawn Stars about the show that goes with Trump's employees and daily disputes (part of a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't be able to hang out with it anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future to the Supreme Court was hanging in a thin thread.
'I think when we did all these crazy shows before time and people said 'This is the beginning at the end of Western civilization'', said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the densest intermediate-selection struggle
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thank you for a conversion of Congress districts that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today a representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit Republicans.
Competition for the 17th district has launched a arms strike on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties their money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb was a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special choice in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat had listened to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a scarce advantage.
USA considered punishing El Salvador based support for China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to throw out the leader group of the Trump organisation.
The Secretarys of State decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department's spokeswoman, in an announcement early this month.
However, punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The penalties imposed, which contained cuts in financial support and targeted restrictions in terms of visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials launched a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and put a stop to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance of the administration to the assembly, said the diplomats.
And the three American broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that was described by the three American ministers, including two diplomats, who were some about discussing the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an unintelligible analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke during anonymity.
Study History
One waits for Special Advisor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now considerable evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller should have turned the spotlight in the investigation into whether Trump's campaign was plotting with Russia's ideira attack on our choice.
If Congress were to change controllers, Trump would have to be set up in this body, preparing to overinterpret the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of 'what about', and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, either for his counterpart in Europe.
It's a choice to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how long the battle can be.
In 1938, the German officer was ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had opposed him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed out on a possibility of avoiding the years of bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unrelenting march accelerates or postpones.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What do we want to do if Trump fires Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water all because this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, and wondered if he was unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
‘How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible debts of sexual assault, and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we in the middle elections vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think I'm wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off the guard to light the Sabbath light on the table asking the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will provide a good starting point for qualifying from Group G of the European League.
A knee-catching midwayer prevented Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 score against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
‘We went into the game with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything in all is a draw probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and it was better made.
On Thursday there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but there will be a tough fight. They got a good result in their previous fight, but with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been our tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the good guys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.»
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in an investigation by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says the Vice-President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you make your wish known good time in advance.
Working with a consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these options may be a major part of determining the costs.
Get an economic advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you secure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: deflect legal fights before they start.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a proxy for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the option yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Make sure that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Write all these details into a written plan, so you are ready.
'It's not just the finances it's about, but who's lying?' asked Martin.
‘What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.»
Man shot several times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun in what he was going home after a trip to town.
The victim in the 40s was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Politicians describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as an ‘accident action’.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are asking for a witness.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, says public servants. The number of deaths is expected to increase.
Without communication, no help workers have received information from Donggala, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the earthquake that had a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, which are on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population in 2017 was 379 800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area that extends more than 300 km from the north-west coast of the island.
The region, which is an administrative region lower than one province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and gardening are the mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is and is important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, following the Indonesia Disaster Reduction Office.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Age of the Pacific and becomes a wretched setting of earthquakes.
Here are some of the great tremors and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A large wave hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit south in Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A strong 7.6 earthquake struck near the town of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused damage and panic when people were reminded of the tremor and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Squandered several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested and targeted for power in the world
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, targeted for assault.
Following a report released by the Alaska State Police Department, Palin (29) was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence, and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su prison, and is being held against bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared "not guilty" when he was asked to give up the network.
Palin is facing three Class A offenders, which means he can be imprisoned for up to one year and get $20,000 in fines.
He has also been targeted for a Class B crime, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been accused of anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was accused of having attacked his father, Todd Palin.
Mora, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
Saga's up in Alaska's veteran's court.
In January 2016, he was targeted for attack in the world, involved in a report of power in the world and to hold a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the event.
His girlfriend had claimed that he beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking his son's elective behavior to PTSD as tribes from when he served in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunami: hundreds of lives lost
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The shift, with the strength of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck right outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the capital of Jakarta.
Videos that show the dramatic moment when the quake hits thrive on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal actors will rarely have the death penalty for suspicion in New York terror
Federal actors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) must have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willfully" and that he "willfully" caused them serious, bodily damage, following a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may result in a possible death penalty, as stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 prosecution points, including eight warrants for murder with the aim of extortion, usually used by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and a screening for the choice and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for ‘substantial planning and thinking’, said the actors and described the way Saipov carried out the attack as ‘disgusting, cruel and corrupt’.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov spring damage and loss for family members and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci’, notes the following:
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last southern district in New York has been sentenced to death in one case.
The aim, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of having killed two drug suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy to engage in spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of information in the days and months that followed, according to legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was what he knew best, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it says in the charges.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared himself guilty at all points of appeal.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are 'clearly disappointed' with the decision of the prosecution authority.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a life-time debt declaration in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the event for all concerned’ said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Member of Tory my Nigel Farage should rent Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promises to ‘mobilise the public army’ today, during a protest at the Tory National Meeting.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that politicians had to ‘feel the pressure’ from the Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May’s MEPs suggested that he should lease the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative, melancholy MEP Peter Bone told the protestors in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “had our way out” no, whether Farage was Brexit’s minister.
With the challenge May faces to reconcile its deeply divided rows has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who want to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister is tired of keeping track of the Chequers compromise following attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Allierte insists that she will press for an agreement with Brussels, despite the step-back – and force the Eurosceptics and the Workers' Party to choose between its package and ‘chaos’.
Bone told Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He proposed that Farage should be given our due rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had run, we would be out now," he said.
The Member of Parliament from Wellingborough added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers'.
To show resistance to the EU, he said: ‘We don’t fight wars to be subordinates.
We will make our own laws in our own country.»
Bone rejects the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 elections: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to be is completely false’.
Brexit champions from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told the reporters, "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people!”
‘Chequers is not popular in the population, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s not popular in our party or our activists that frequent the streets and get us selected from the beginning.
Please, drop Chequers and listen to me»
In a message pointing to May, she adds, 'Ministers will keep their jobs when they keep what they promise'.
Farage said politicians need to know the heat if they're going to betray the decision that was made in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we can't let them get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: ‘I want you to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to know the heat.
‘We mobilize the public army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and should not fall asleep until we have become an independent, self-governed, proud United Kingdom.

‘It’s a total farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after warrants give over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes were going to play a major role during the course.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and let Hamilton get into the traffic at the back of the lane, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but the Hamilton port in front of it after some action side-by-side which meant that the Ferrari driver againstvilleg had to leave the inside free to not be able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led a large part of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot on the 44th round, but couldn't speed up the last eight laps while the Raikkonen got fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valterie did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not like the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the witness Ford had given directly to the Senate Commission, but also commented that what goes on in the Senate showed that people were ‘bad and bad and talking stupid’.
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and bad and uncomfortable and talking untrue," he said.
‘When you look at publications and leaks and then say ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you think?
Diane Feinstein, did you paint that?
Do you think of her answer... do you read the document - "Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not lacquer it.’
Please wait a moment.
Lak me... no, we didn't paint it,” he added, while he was imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leak out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's address, I didn't tell her story," said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for.”
But her nodding doesn't fall in good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While he persists in defending the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of poor sexual conduct by three women, the President proposed that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
'They are determined to take power back in all ways they see the need.
You see the misery, the frenzy, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run against in order to gain power and control," said the president in the following Mediaite.

Pilot loses his life to ensure that hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
An airliner in Indonesia will be hailed as a hero after he loses his life in what he continues to ensure that an aircraft with several hundred passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and there are many who are trapped in wrecks in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even if it fluctuated wildly.
He was left to make sure that the plane that was on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have scared hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We're sending a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
‘This is heartbreaking,’ he added.
In the meantime, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country’s crisis management agency says that access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, who is going to keep a mass grave on Sunday.
Naudhelp comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance with several bodies comes.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been Robbed.’
Jan Gelfand, leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the Army in the country, "I'm asking everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?’ CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, and 550 people died.
Flight Control in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports no man missing after lagoon flight
The airline that operated an aircraft that ran in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that from Saturday afternoon they don't know where the human passenger is.
The airline said they work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline no longer provided details of the passenger, and its age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water when it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone was in a stable condition.
It's still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened to her.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, which brought them up to life, to the emergency exits on the plane before it sank.
He said that the flight crew had panic and screams, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, working to improve a berth, also frightened passengers with a rubber boat that they used to transport passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in the airfields of the PNG-registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them have flown with Air Niugini.
Analysts create overnight timeline when woman was burned alive
The prosecution authority presented all the evidence on Saturday during the main lawsuit for a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice's analyst Paul Rowlett testifies for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He produced for the jury how he collided with cell phone recordings to find out what her night was when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he used location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers' night she died, as opposed to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
Then the charges asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, said Sanford that he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another counterseiing was that Tellis said he had known Chambers in about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Telli deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
'He deleted her from his life,' said Hale.
The defence shall terminate the proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that same day.

Another black person?!
New York Children's Passport sues couples for being fired for "racist" text message
A babysitter in New York sues a couple to fire her on the basis of discrimination after she got a wrong text message from her mother who complained that she was ‘even a black person’.
The couple have refused to be racist and compare the claim with ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had assigned, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
«NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ONLY A SHORT PERSON,» wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, he sent him to babysitting Maurice, twice.
After realizing her fault, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman babysitter Maurice fired, and said that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for having fired her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she should have had, even if it was out of contract, where she was going to live with the family.
‘I want to show them that it’s not okay to do this,’ she said to The New York Post on Friday, adding, ‘I know there’s discrimination.’
The couple have denied that they are racists, and said that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid that she was going to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco of The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you've offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to insult them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.’
Plasco compares the case with ‘expression’ and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
«Are you really going to engage a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
As matters progress, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behaviour and logic.
The publisher behind Paddington books was afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know now how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected.
When it comes to Paddington, as she described as ‘a very important member of the family,’ she added that her father was proud of the inside of his success.
'He was a rather quiet man, and he never laughed,' she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you become proud of them even though you're not really behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed the daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in all the haste, how doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't believe she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I'm so happy for you, dear.
I'll be right back to be with you.
I'll be right there.
The medical doctors had given her so that her heart would continue pumping was slowly on the way out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't grumble or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold everything in."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now taking care of the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
‘I put my head down while my tears fall.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how happy she was."
Grieving women hang notes on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who killed themselves are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are partying on a bridge in Wales that's going to inspire and get people who are going to kill themselves to change their mind and call the numbers on the notes.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
‘I don’t want anyone’s parents to feel the way I know myself every day.’
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died he ended up at work, because he was in a "real dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first to find Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that the sibling may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes 'for people to know that there were other people out there who care and that they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has our friends with Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother's.
"He never told me he was tired or depressed or anything," she said.
«A few days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the cellar emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts he did not see at that time."
She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they kept working through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we must all fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
‘I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he was asking for — a limited research — we might get some loneliness,’ said Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid of the committee ‘jointly’ in the middle of a partisan-backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The U.S. averages are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it hard for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called the senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then has been the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to voice in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh is able to collect at least 50 voices in the Senate.
Number of skipperes in North Korea to go down under Kim
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean legislator
Park Byeong-suck referred to data from the Korean Association Department, and said there were 1127 jumpers last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter boundaries between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling fees are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of the North Koreans get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed borders illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the flights via China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at decapitators as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with coercion.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are still technically at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became involved in working for an atomic-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho owed the United States not to achieve anything since then.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation, we cannot disarm our weapons first,’ said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't stand in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominee of the Supreme Court, "hysterically" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’ said Pelosi about the testimony to Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all the appeals that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes yelled with lumps in his throat as he told of his family and years of going on.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, and called the charges against him "a grotto and a planned attack on his reputation," organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't stand in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he's prejudiced against democrats.
"I think the way he behaved he disqualifies, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to leave if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats obtain a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, he can't stand in the Supreme Court, nor in the Court he thinks now," added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a court of appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi also said that as a democrat, she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he was going to reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court to expect us to say he's great," said Pelosi.
And women must turn the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's unusual, do you think?'
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I cried.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears work as a way to get out of the mind, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I sensed anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been terrified – and pulled me out in the hall.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
'They don't know you're furious.
They think you're bored and they're watering because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken into being on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well stand in elections as President himself.
"I had not really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
‘There were already seven other candidates who made choices, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone calls the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’.
Since the campaign had already taken place for a while, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that she would only remain silent if she was able to collect $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
'Do they think I'll get a discount?' she asked.
When she declared that she did not come to make choices anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and aim at the smokers instead of the divider streets, and anger against the sex discrimination, that she began crying during the speech.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," said Schroeder about how the press reacted when she saw her branch.
«You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
‘How paragraph’?’
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening stage in the trade war between the United States and China was pristine, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage to Beijing in a long time, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot the first shot this year in estimating important Chinese exports, including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariff rates on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariff rates of between five and ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the U.S. every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to fail with the first.
To get Washington to stop, China has to do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the US press can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go under is more dangerous than people dare to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thought-smack.
Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is making progress.
‘Today, the ground situation is more stable and secure, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism,’ he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal territory.
All commitments are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel, on the basis of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe secures says in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in the Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the American star, tossed most of the tournament, beat the ball in the water from the tea at hole 16, par 3, and then gave the saying to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5/4 of the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
‘I usually didn’t cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful for Thomas choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I could help," said an emotional Garcia, according to the European saying.
He's passing the sticks on to the compatriot John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I know an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup through the career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who have won 14 big titles and are only turned off by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team went on to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, spoke out after a disappointing show from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
It was periods this morning that we made it hot for Europe.
We're in the middle of something.
The hat of for Thomas.
He's a single captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off his hat.
We were played around."
