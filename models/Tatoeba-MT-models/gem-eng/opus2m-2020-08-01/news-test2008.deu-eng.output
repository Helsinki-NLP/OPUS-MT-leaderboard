Food blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area was the rapid rise in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, inflation was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual rate of inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are based on only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the lead rate.
The ECB strives to keep the inflation rate below two per cent, or at least close to the two per cent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the twin mill: inflation had to be "agreed" in order to exclude the need for action later.
At 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation in Germany reached a twelve-year record high in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increase in inflation in the euro area was responsible for the increase in food and energy prices.
The MATIF wheat quotations rose by 88 percent, and the price for soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also significantly expensive in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil rose by 52 percent this year - last month the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 percent in 2008, but is projected to decrease to 1.9 percent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts estimate a 3-percent inflation rate, but estimate the annual average rate at 2.1 percent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice.
Gallup Location Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while consent for the socialists according to Gallup has reached an unprecedented 13 percent low point.
In the case of the party-faithful voters, the difference is clear thanks to the high determination of the opposition supporters: More than two-thirds (71 percent) are opposed to a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP's approval.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary entry point: they reach two percent in the total population.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low point, the general economic mood has deteriorated further - never before has the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "very bad" been so high (41%), while another 46 percent consider it "fairly bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration in the situation; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historic high - considered the work of the Prime Minister to be "more bad than right".
Thirteen percent of respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the percentage of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% distrust of the Fidesz party leader.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of people who think that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be overcome without change of government.
If, after the unrest last October, 35% were still in favour of the government and the head of government, this figure is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in re-elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with certainty", and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
By comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "with certainty", another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these tendencies, the result of the referendum would be foreseeable.
74% would vote against the tuition fees, 79% against the practical fee, and 84% against the hospital daily allowance.
Moving to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even amount to 81, 84, and 89 percent respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by almost one-fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser commercial area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser Handelsdreieck, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but price increases of more than 1,000 HUF have been registered in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets were "davongallopped" last December, the percentage of the price has not fallen dramatically, compared to the already high, earlier starting level.
However, it certainly has a deterrent effect on consumers that what they paid for last year is far less than 9000 HUF this year, not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was HUF 10,573.
(In 6800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at the previous year's level, while the prices for puten breast fillets, walnuts and poppies have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg breadwakes for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price crash in the product to less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pan bottle of less than 200 forint, so the drink included pfand cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" shopping cart comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the past year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT was noticeable at last Christmas.
This was precisely the case with trade: apparently the department stores could not quite decide which price margin to apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were inevitable.
(If the dealer ill-planned the speed of circulation of a product, it can fall for substantial profits in the price range, which depends on the traffic intensity.)
The cost of the "Napi" shopping cart fell so radically last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more at 1,630.00 Forint than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was observed, with the price of daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of Hungary's Central Statistical Office: for some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30% cost over the 12 months period.
So in about next to flour also with eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year has increased by hardly more than 10 percent even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - after all, they have been able to shift the drastic increase in price to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, hypermarkets do not complain; it is constantly reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three department stores no longer look at the prices.
It is bought from all large quantities, durable foods go in pallets across the barn tables.
Wednesday morning morning in all three department stores there were endless snakes at the cash register when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain with the opinion researchers, they could not even achieve the planned turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals due to improper handling of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overloading of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors that are not at all conducive to the containment of the infections, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places the disinfectants are also saved.
A MRSA infection was recently diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. Since then, an important surgery has not been performed due to the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10th this year, multi-resistant pathogen infections were reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomomialis Surveillance System, according to Karolina Böröcz, the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Center.
So many infections caused by multi-resistance pathogens have been recorded in hospitals with certainty, but the dark number is likely to be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about one third of the people in its nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as sore throat, almond inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the funds are too high or used improperly, the well-responsive bacteria produce antibiotics-resistant, which spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with a weakened, or permanently functioning immune system, but also in the elderly, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i. e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the daily routine.
One should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, said Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is just not there where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - says Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are being examined for MRSA during their hospitalisation, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current prevailing conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable for the inhibition of the emergence or spread of the multi-resistance pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and old-age homes, the hospitals should investigate the patients admitted and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In Hungarian hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practised so often.
Not least because there are no grants from the state health insurance fund for this investigation.
Most cases would therefore not be brought to light until the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive is not always complied with by hospitals.
Among the outpatients, or patients in the primary care, microbiological samples were even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are saved
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transferred by caregivers from one patient to another.
This is precisely why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks are of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are often even crowded, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further points out, unfortunately, in the less well-off hospitals it appears that disinfectants are saved, there are few caregivers, many patients - all the factors that actually favour the development of infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, such infections are shown to be much less common there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are observed.
Government programme against MRSA
Getting MRSA infections into control causes the health insurance huge costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreasing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of multi-resistance pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Head of Death Control was not drunk
In the case of a fatal car accident caused by the head of the XXII District, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired chief of police of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday in a car accident, was neither alcoholic nor drug-induced, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesperson of the Budapest State Attorney on Friday after the official report was presented on the case.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation that the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before he put himself on the check.
The former police chief, with his own passenger car in XXII. District, landed in Kossuth Lajos Street, crossing a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder circumstance - the handlebar has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, afterglow.)
The pedestrian was injured after his arrival at the hospital.
According to police reports, the handlebar suffered a shock, then relinquished its functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has launched its investigations into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest. The money will be channelled into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and the energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented with grants from the Cohesion Fund. The EUR 200 million loan agreement has already been signed in the past, the current agreement deals with the use of EUR 200 million.
The sum of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be devoted to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later as part of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly be incorporated into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, metro line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of metro financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available free of commission by the EIB with a delay of 8 years.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all of Europe is looking intently at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, but is becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most sought after patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with cheap ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik are also more and more needed.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country is also intended to attract investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the extremely favorable area of Russians, more buyers are listed.
The capital Sofia also offers tempting offers - commercial and office spaces offer highest returns.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golfer's paradises, thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons also in the other two seasons.
Foresight investors therefore already buy in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle either buy revitalized properties by 50-100.000 euros, or come down houses by 5-15,000 euros, which they will then renovate themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group comprises businessmen who invest with the aim of raising medium- to long-term value.
Real estates in the capital are becoming increasingly expensive due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an increase in prices of 21 percent per year.
The price of real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries discuss the Bali roadmap, which sets out emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a heated debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate specific figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue at the conference is whether the industrialised countries are willing to support developing countries financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member Council, expected to be included in the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as reported in the "Piac és Geut".
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its pioneering role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "agreement after 2012" would be successful, or not. The Union would even be prepared to make a 30% reduction if other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries, are also willing to meet their commitments according to forces and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, whereas the EU had already committed itself to a reduction of 8% with its then 15 member states.
The standard for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully meet, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until 2012, in which case the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted in its recent report by the IPCC, the International Nobel Peace Prize-winning UN Scientific Committee on Climate Change.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the increase of the Earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army Reels on YouTube
UK Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos on operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras shot on helmets are controlled at the air force base in Kandahar and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
According to defence expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, propaganda of this kind is almost free of charge, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message in their own right to the existence of the military measures decided by the government.
American advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur shootings, which, in addition to carefully processed, censored recordings, also create the net - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films speak of the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, many videos already in use have been loaded onto the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "gift".
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less life-like simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth is by no means simplistic: instead of a Christmas celebration, she is organising a work conference where her employees can end up in 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchant Christmas spirit with Tombola or impulses into the official hearts.
Party, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffet - this is how power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held in the defence department this year, but the staff of the ministry are not expected to do so.
During the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are donated by fallen soldiers, during the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers who are currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other departments, the National Agency for Development (NDA) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport beat the strings.
The 4.32 Mio Forint Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
Although the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a tombola draw.
The National Agency for Development (NDE) held its 4.7 million forint Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a feast.
The hall rent was 1 million forint and the rest was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a section of the NPSU is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information, as we have not reached the authorities.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NPSU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
Upon request of [origo], they said: There was no ball dress or suit duty at the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are preparing for puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to the annual conference.
If you expect about 180 guests, who - according to the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogatsche, then the celebration will begin with 350,000 forint.
Minister of Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will simply start with his colleagues in the Ministry's abstinence.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured at 2,500 forint per head - around this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incitement.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM have celebrated in this way each year.
However, there will be no real party atmosphere - not only because of the official speech of the minister, but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites you to a New Year reception on January 20, this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration falls.
One hundred guests are asked to visit the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget") and according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions, which are held each year, traditionally start with a short speech from the minister and sound with restraining muttering.
As the relevant press offices report on [Origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration either at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Asked about the costs of the Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration held at the Kunstgewerbemuseum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest assembly is held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the Health Insurance Act - the work is to begin.
It is expected to suffer from strike-related, significant traffic handicaps, as rail traffic is almost completely stopped, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) also strike until 1 p.m.
Monday strike details will be announced jointly by the League of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a large-scale protest assembly will be held, and from Monday, all organisations that have joined the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite period, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike started on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss the further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will only come to the vote on the Health Insurance Act in the evening, or even at midnight.
The strike that starts on Monday will have to be expected to cause considerable traffic difficulties: the railway companies are laying down their work for an indefinite period of time, in the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are stationary.
At the same time, there will be roadblocks in many places in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others plan temporary job losses.
Until Thursday afternoon, no agreement could be reached between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railways VDSZZZ on sufficient services, although more and more people are on the way by train just around Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV from start-up to 1 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m., the Liga unions for electricity and heat energy lay down the work for four hours, and the teachers' union e.g. the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for 2 or 8 hourly strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors strikes nationwide at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points demanded by the league is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model due from next year.
The third requirement is that access to the early retirement scheme is already possible for the eligible professional groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the offer made by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
Among other things, the Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states that, in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancement of existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this was the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at provocation of such an argument, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma issue to representatives of radical political groups who have now built up their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary contrast".
It is believed that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least because of the enormous attention given by local and foreign media, "have seriously damaged Hungary's image abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has been steadily on the rise, so that since summer 2007 several "national self-defense association" organisations have been established.
"These groups are in common that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly boasting of preparing their members for defence tasks - sometimes armed - (catastrophe protection, state defence, order-keeping), calling upon the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And on the other hand, all of this happens in accordance with that method, which tries to camouflage various political and party-based aspirations as a bourgeois initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not merely the circumvention of legal barriers that could arise in the course of the registration at the court - it is also a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-raising factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians from certain neighbouring countries see in the emergence of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass exodus took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion of the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In her opinion, the last 17 years have seen a real "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained indiscriminate and indifferent - according to the Political Capital.
And further: the initiative had started a fierce debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to start their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react with the organisation of their own protection against the threats, it is stated in the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital said on request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changed trends should be recognised, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issuing of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary, holidays are regulated by law, so that the practice of redeploying the working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the coming year gives us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "Feast Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Unemployed days are usually church holidays, or are related to important historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the latter alone so that the New Year's celebrations can rest.
All year round we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The public holidays are the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the anniversary of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the foundation of the state, celebrated on May 1st, we commemorate our dead on November 1st and 2nd.
In addition, there are every two holidays at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our public, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of the "working day shift" has proved itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be worked out, the Minister of Labour has been set out in his own regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public servants and public service officials.
Only companies and establishments in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on public holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order is only confused by the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, life will stand here formally, as most will take time off for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, or the special holiday for it.
In the next year, more holidays will fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redisposables in working days than this year.
The calendar is first put "on the head" around the day of work, so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal is linked to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th you will have to work on Friday, October 24th.
At the end of the year, however, the holiday will be marked by no more than 24 December, after everything is and will remain, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six daunting little things to annoy colleagues at work
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't even notice us anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The only question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you're better placed to the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it up to yourself by perhaps calling at the marketing department and confessing recklessly, one would have forgotten to forward the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you get caught up in embarrassing excuses, you should think about how you can really prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something you don't own?
There's hardly anything more nervous than grabbing a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday, the stapler was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believed ballpoint pen discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, we should not borrow anything from our colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any envelopes or post-it out of the office, because it could hit you yourself: none more, if you really need it.
Tragic about the private lives of colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a trajectory that has already been put into the world.
Who's with whom, what's done?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not, as far as possible, be tied to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and reveals his innermost secret to us, we should not take advantage of that trust!
It is best to keep silent like a grave, rather than directing those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick without reason?
If you call in the office to report yourself ill with painful headaches, because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, unresponsive executions, projects with fixed dates now have to be done by your colleagues instead of by yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know the day before, that you will not be able to do it in the office the next day, or that something could come in between, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with absence.
Total, Cheaters, Telephone
One is just in the depths of his work but is suddenly disturbed by the loud gibberish of the ladies?
Unwanted to listen to a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't be bothering your colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you're leading across your heads), getting hitchhiking, persistent shivering or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, you should not seek the guilt of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk to the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit his mistakes, and if others were affected, apologize!
The question of how to make up for the mistake again, or the failure, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should you dress so poorly if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too slutty - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so much that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, also beautiful and elegant!
To make it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of all morning traffic.
From the radio a strange melody sounds: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The domestic music scene has not spoiled us for a long time with qualitative electropop.
But now you can even see the jam differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the domestic digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock is "in" with its guitar quilt again, the local electropop proves: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musicalized himself in the band Yonderboi before he began to walk his own way - perhaps because a inn does not have two pipes.
However, the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from jazz, electronic, and pop, was only when one had approached him with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially occurred in smaller clubs, only became known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" released its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was the almost only trendsetter marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now released, entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead", could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying sound would also be fine, but besides the essential character of the music, the louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll, appear - the zeitgeist and the trends.
With these songs the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it into a radio hitter - the newest mr2 Petőfi who broadcasts pop music from early to late has gradually set the earworm to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six local singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be shallow and unspeakable, but they can also only be produced for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also be created from an honest motive.
The audience also operates independently of languages and national borders according to this principle.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a bigger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that are happening around them much more closely, because they also consider them to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it's a good feeling to see that more and more of our concerts are coming.
But we never composed for the market.
With us the music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is usually noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn there is only in the immature changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing has come to my attention: if you want to make everyone right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don't really go his way, except that you try to interpret this into our music again and again.
We see ourselves as a team player who trusts in the musical presence of the other and lets them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petőfi, "Wings of Love" is the first priority.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which was then to hold as a drag horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finale of the album with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly her, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
So the six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was created, which we then baptized as "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want to have the song the same, or did the girls co-design it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for longer, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number still needs "something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody that night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came down practically and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I remember I was pretty electrified at the time, but it also needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so powerful.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert one had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo part (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role of their own, sing together completely and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not just accompanied by the music.
They were also standing on stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Z.: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not deliberately want to let them have solo rolls.
In the number it's also about forgetting one's ego a little bit, forgetting who came from where and where to go, we just let ourselves have these particular wings that lift the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: Which was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks when mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything came together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite track from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts and also now where I "released" the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Defrauded brokers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Soilless deceiver
Thus his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came by almost five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to do it the same way, and was certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in time on the American mortgage market.
"He is mentally rather weak," was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him to the police.
However, as the statements made by the French media, such as the Le Monde daily, show, he was a person who had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just during the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there was already the first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had earlier problems with paying would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to 1.6 billion euros.
"Just as I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," admits Kervilie and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the whole interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that they don't get to him.
He even managed to lead his bosses to the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to an agent and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kervilel explained to the investigating officer.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of Allianz he earned a lot by placing half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses supposedly knew everything, or guessed.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
Suspect made himself suspect by a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A broker who does not take a vacation is one who does not want to be looked into the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which will enable the Czech Republic to reach 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into traffic expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and comprises up to 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have more than 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative businesses.
Companies will thus gain finance for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, as well as for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in the EU fund money acquisition so far.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice confirms twenty years of imprisonment for ex-Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazieda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
According to AP, whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) gets back behind bars is currently unclear.
According to the head of the appeal court, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether they have Alemán put his sentence at home or whether he has to go to prison.
A court noted four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund that Alemán had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget designed by this government and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The same year was approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because he had been presented by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and the ČSSD was therefore unable to accept him.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion of censure against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little-considered, yet highly important law in all peace.
That's kind of paradoxical.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the household, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is obscured by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and that is why they pay more attention to him.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The government budgets of the past Social-Democratic governments suffered from three weaknesses, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure which is compulsory by law, not only in terms of pensions, but also in terms of social expenditure which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors have issued unconsidered debt securities, which have led to their over-indebtedness to their city halls, in order to open up additional sources of investment except income from taxes, taxes and bank credits.
In recent years, they have been able to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares in the energy and other supply networks that they had received in the course of privatization from the State.
Now this source is already sealed.
To the extent that we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been growing for a number of years, like the rest of the world, whose ČSSD boasts without letup.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to correct public finances.
Instead, however, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our Republic.
This is a huge disgrace, mainly due to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are at least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Even if some of the stupid populist expenditures that were adopted this year before the elections have succeeded, it is clear that if in the near future there will not be a shift in retirement age and pension reform, then virtually any policy in this country will end, and no matter who is in power, nothing will remain to him as a mere administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that government officials will become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The 2008 deficit of SEK 70 billion would be superfluous if previous governments hadn't spent what went on in the last ten years.
If we do not want it to really happen to be purely administrative officials from ruling politicians, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but aware that the state can only spend as much as it can take on taxes and fees, to want peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
Thus, more than 100 billion dollars will enter the currency markets via auctions.
At these auctions, the banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 makes it easy for the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time after the 11th September attacks, that the central banks of the individual states agree on such a coordinated approach to the defence or mitigation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to remove the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing shortage of freely available capital that banks can grant," wrote Bernard Baumohl, a consultant at Economic Outlook Group, in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," added Baumöl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of unserviceable loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what can still do when they decided to do so," said ABN Amro's chief economist, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into recession, possibly with consequences for economic growth around the world.
The central banks decided to do so after they failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate, which is used to transfer money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, and this despite the fact that the central banks of the USA, Canada and the UK had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the warming up of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change is said to harm developing countries the most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the ending international conference of the UN on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue Planet, Not a Green Planet", he explained that the debate of the ecologists is unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which represents a strange mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the presentation of his book that his topic was very important to him and that he was therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction at the fact that his book appeared in German translation because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
So now interested people could read his attitude undistorted.
Klaus reminded me that he was not a climatologist, but in his opinion he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
After all, he was an academic, able to understand and evaluate professional treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a nationalist.
As the main statement of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists on global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considered it to be someone who had experience with totalitarian systems, unacceptable to impose other unproved views, he viewed this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On questions from those present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus had talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't change their driver's license
600000 drivers failed to change their old driving licence, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for a replacement so that the authorities can manage to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers go on the streets without valid driving rights.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive anymore did not exchange their driving licence.
While small places report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of lighters, the offices of the capital are being overburdened with requests, and the interest in the exchange was still growing this week.
The city administration completes around 2,000 customers every day.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The exhibition of a new driver's license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must add 500 crowns.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange by the end of the year and leave without a valid driver's licence are threatened with a fine from January onwards.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also let it be used with a reminder when they commit a violation.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may increase to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the person can also receive from the church a punishment that does not go at all.
He could, it was said, face a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called upon the offices to allow Mildness to prevail and to impose a maximum penalty of 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crown sentence.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal ID card that everyone, including a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give their driver's license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent local authority or send him there by registered mail.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalidated.
However, drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 will end in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied to Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of having made a common cause with the gang of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Oberlandesgericht in Prague, which reduced its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no possibility of appeal against today's judgment, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but first he is faced with the first instance judgment.
In other trials, however, he had already received penalties of a total of 16 years.
He cannot be condemned for more than that.
In January, a district court accused 19 people of being involved in robbery, and the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused disputed the charge from the beginning on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with, among other things, Berdych criminals provided information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped gang members to escape the prosecution.
The band left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the spoils.
The charges are about crimes committed by the gangs from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, in the case of robberies whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also in the case of official convictions and illicit possession of weapons.
In case of house searches, the police discovered illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to the charge, the gang has enriched itself by millions of crowns because of their robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this trial, Berdych courts and a number of others for further robberies were found to be legally guilty.
Other men from Berdych's vicinity have to answer in another trial, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main proceedings have so far been held by Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč wants 12 million kroner compensation plus court fees.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million each.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore totally disagrees with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal because it is too high," said Dostál after today's debate.
"But in order to be able to express an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the opposite had to be drawn up.
We'll find out if it has any significance at all.
However, we believe that all of this should lie in the hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, a report was used as the basis for compensation negotiations, which he had prepared for him at the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men were more prone to the stress situation, even if they had seen accusations against themselves that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, do worse with the aftereffects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening now, Veleba summarized the contents.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses at the maternity clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) handed over 100000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenses created to them by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability.
In case of doubt, they must resort to a reserve fund, but only exceptionally can they request assistance from the institution.
The courts have so far awarded comparatively low damages to those affected, the amounts have been determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka came around his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the District Court judge in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polivka did not take part in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably be calling.
"The issue is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitic," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
In the words "Walach Kingdom" everyone introduced themselves to this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have an almost ten-year job behind us.
"Creation of funds and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is dispute over money.
"After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic at our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that did not coincide with the intention of creating a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From a fun action, a business and business activity crystallized, to which Harabiš joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the show "Manege" for his business intentions.
"Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team, who had devoted themselves to him intensively.
The cooperation of the parties that were disputed today lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the funeral of "King Boleslavs I. elected until the day of St. Nimmerleins".
The leadership role then took on Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed an action against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to reveal details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like the royal parade in the Walach.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also register quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Disassemble progenitors
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I only remain to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, about the lack of headroom on the back seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the bodywork of the combination is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Move on quickly.
I only go through the interior to not repeat myself too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I object only because of the caring middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more design design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times when we may complain about short seats or headrests.
The side-holding has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also feel the larger dimensions of the body.
In the combination, the already mentioned lack of head freedom has also been eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car, however, is the cargo bay.
I have to call it (even because of the foldable rear window) very loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with straps that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, are torn apart, and hold even heavier objects.
But let's talk about the charge volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains at noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when a pram is invited.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with engine capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600-cubic engine should look like, driving a family-hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves away well.
If I compare him to his counterpart at Škoda, who sometimes seems to be stuffed with a rag, then I can only be excited by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly popular.
But we must remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine in the amount of 329900 crowns is still valid.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The equipment Premium of the test car beats once again with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wiper release, electric window lifters at the back and...
Thus, the car costs a total of simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains, which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe is increasing, causing local fears about the further development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even detect cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between the local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, harassment and robbery among students have shifted to relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself with the boy insulting them with racist insults.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two underage girls.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks to the man and thrown him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us apples and pears and then blew up his seat," a Slovak student in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the conflict with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases cited show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks came here on a job search.
Some 30,000 Slovak students, therefore, attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will come true if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with cellars offering pizza, ice cream and enchanting cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish conquest, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havana once became a warehouse or transit warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Built it was one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the trial) was popularly seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests included:
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high houses, across the broad boulevards, drove cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lying.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars from the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you mix cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties drive around in Havana until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salty and damp air.
Mag Havana, especially its oldest part, has come down strongly, nowhere can you find so many wonderful colonial sights around here.
Other places are just being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for money from tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and diesel-powered narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Her car park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see there neat and fully functioning locomotives, whose peers are located elsewhere in the museum.
Exploration targets
The most important places do not leave out the majority of the visitors to Cuba.
So you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail.
Just keep mentioning that in the already mentioned estate Hemingways there is a museum whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, climbed steeply from the valley floor, and in their caves, fertile soil grew, which also covers weathered rock areas of dense vegetation.
This valley is where maybe the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road that would have connected the area to the rest of the country.
This isolation helped to keep it unattended.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was demolished, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of sugar factories".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after the darkness, and where the music does not silence until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in eastern Cuba is one of the most beautiful in the island.
This view is certainly also influenced by the way to it.
Both streets, which lead from Guantánamo, must overcome high and crooked mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
This eastern front post of Cuba included UNESCO in its world heritage directory, thanks to its unspoiled nature.
There the best chocolate is made, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are seen several tablets, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, about all this one could write many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
According to the United States, too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, design a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not follow their ideas, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, called the NATO units to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, forward development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to start developing the economy and security themselves," says British Minister of Defense Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern Helmand province even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, allies have come to an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In concrete terms, they call on other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke.
"I am not pleased about what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the agency Reuters to conclude three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries involved, there has also been a dispute over whether all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best in recent months.
Germany, for example, was criticized for being passive.
"The Germans are quite numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the battle requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers "faulpelze" this week.
"Afghanistan's Non-Sturbated: The Germans make games while our boys are fighting," wrote the "Sun" in an article that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing the table tennis.
The German imagery went over to the counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt will accelerate to one trillion in 2009
Every Czech has a government debt of 84,000 kroner.
Total debt rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to owe itself to 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
Every Czech has a debt of 84000 kroner.
Over the entire past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"So far, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not be able to exceed the limit of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, says: "To exceed a trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next household we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage should be shown to change, and politicians should be prepared to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I don't expect such a change," he remarked.
Debt growth
The government's debt stems from the government's debt and comes mainly from the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury instructions, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, by bonds issued by the European Investment Bank.
Domestic government debt has increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion kroner at the end of September and has dropped by 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt rose to 6.5 years.
"Total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot considering how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting to note that growth is mainly recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt rises, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the way public debt was handled for 2007 show that the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the better development of government budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner.
This amount is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion kroner instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, it is the maximum planned budget for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a 10-billion-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion and the instalments for the bonds of the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a teddy bear a name, she was introduced to a court in Khartoum today.
On Thursday evening, a court in Khartoum sentenced the British teacher, who had been accused in Sudan of insulting Islam, to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British were accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy Bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped.
After several complaints from students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was picked up at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam under Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reported headmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a name that is very common in Sudan.
Afterwards, the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the caption My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbon's Muslim colleagues teaching at the same school in Sudan explained that he knows them well, and she would never have done anything to draw too close to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion that many teachers share, which they describe as very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks about religion in class.
It should be borne in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of tribute to the Prophets (which is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you, for example, give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last hearing in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach an agreement on the status , said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the threat of peace in the region, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, urged them to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue their talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
Violence is not expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
At the end of the hearings on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet one last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August from the UN received the order for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their commission to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of Kosovo's independence on the Security Council, are continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the administration of the UN for eight years, the Western countries regard independence under EU supervision as the only solution with a future.
Pristina is ready to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council is not to decide in their favor.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the Autonomous Authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, felt that a compromise was always to be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is so much weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken solely by the Security Council, where its Russian ally holds a veto right.
The House of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the Security Council's ranks is acceptable to Serbia, said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people will expire in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush exclaims an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered on Tuesday under his direction in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything possible to help them conclude a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to stop their colonization work, Bush said, recalling their commitment to the peace roadmap agreed by the two parties in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, under Abbas, aim at a peace treaty that will resolve all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three serious problems that are mainly the result of the Israeli-Palestinian disputes: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the present state of Israel in the course of the 1948 conflict.
After the President of the United States, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a solution for all issues, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook to conduct the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to make an effort to put an end to them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, a Palestinian and a side by side Israeli, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received a guarantee in this sense from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries, which offers peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a pathway in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the state attorney, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on the road, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesperson of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without approval, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had ignored its progress from the right, a policeman continued.
Alcohol control carried out on vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (continuous wing, split windshield, torn bumper rod) testifies to the tightness of the impact.
Very quickly, as early as yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an investigation into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main management for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the IGPN from the police's responsibility at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were heard Sunday evening confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small-power bike has arrived relatively quickly on its left.
Yesterday showed a kind of riot, certainly caused by the friction of the footrests on the ground, that the two vehicles had remained interlocked until the police managed to slow down.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obscured yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police had left the accident site very quickly, and that without helping the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would exclude any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of investigations that are necessary for further investigations and that require very careful action.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, trying to revive her, this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a totally disturbed policeman who limped.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people who telephoned the fourth.
In view of the tension which arose rapidly around the event and, as it seems, due to the certainty of the people present about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the place of the accident.
Still according to this testimony, the rescue forces met about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used cardiac massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police force did not help the young people.
First aid has been given to these young people.
The fire department came immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, for her part, emphasized the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had proclaimed the emergency two days earlier.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken in the emergency were injured by the tear gas grenades deployed by the police there.
They then threw stones at the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios existed in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them had been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition officials, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were held in Multan (middle) and Peshawar (north-east).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president invited the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency and to those who had taken an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
He had to take a position in a direct election on 6 October in the following days on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News stated.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command of the army and to become a civilian president no longer applies since the call for emergency, stated on Monday the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would surrender his military uniform until November 15th, the date on which his first term as President ends.
The Deputy Minister for Information has also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy commander.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the New Wirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the various methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births today were carefully planned.
With one out of five couples even calculated on the month exactly, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the space shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical part that is about to take over the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17,5 tonnes heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS, in order to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew engaged in the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can be folded up like accordions was damaged by a taped cable at a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector any more.
The astronauts, who originally left the space shuttle for a check-up and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotational system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30-metre long remote-controlled arm of the space shuttle, which had been installed at the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resilient, very skillful, he has a well-developed torso and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore selected to operate on the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut through the faulty cable and fixed some kind of rail on the damaged spot.
He was supported by a second Spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey bat, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors that generate several hundred volts, had the astronauts on board the station designed and built.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully refurbished before counting his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space shuttle Discovery to enter the Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS is sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the Group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counter the A400M's residuals, EADS is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
EADS currently loses 4% to EUR 21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again, referring to the residues caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which delay the flight of the young aircraft.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft range between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced the parent group of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to this cost, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 on the presentation of its quarterly results for the coming Thursday, without adding any additional detail.
The group also states that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
In memory, EADS’ business performance has fallen from 86% in 2006 due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the Russians will vote for President Putin's party, the United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters, who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He is doing this in his capacity as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything be seen when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was satisfied with providing a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they were displaced.
She brags an electoral campaign defyed by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the suppression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-shock world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days' imprisonment for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned from visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two very important questions arise:
Who will put Putin's successor as president?
The official newspaper announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections, 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot stand for a third consecutive term of office.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the all-powerful United Russia Party, which will elect the government and president?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary or presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the master of their destiny, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which was christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
Following the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has once again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not a terrorist, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians forgo the personal responsibility they have shown for a short time after the collapse of the USSR.
Think about it for what long?
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to hold the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) maintain the United Russia's local electoral lists.
The new freedoms from the West are often the same as chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Consider what for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they replace?
A heavy commemoration
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been housed in Bad Arolsen for a total length of 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-based, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, entrusted with their administration, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will enable them to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of the concentration camps and the health status of the forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of this archive, which is managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The inmates of the concentration camps or the warrants issued by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest to pave the way for them to be compensated.
Even today, more than 300 permanent staffed tens of thousands of personal requests are working in Bad Arolsen.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing Bad Arolsen.
One cannot expect anything fundamentally new in these documents, explained Pr. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Center for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
At present, trade between India and Europe has reached 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's most important trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's foreign ministers had given the European Commission the green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), and mutual trade between India and Europe is already reaching the EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will drive the two economies forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson .
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants exchange goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion each year, this week Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission’s New Delhi delegation, said and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the alarm and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about curbing the recurring concern about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual maturity.
In order to mitigate the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly harsh at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions at that time , the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it shall state in a notice .
The Bank further states that on December 6th, around 12.15 GMT 10 billion (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the land tax rate and only until January 10th.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE will circulate liquidity in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the interest rates on interbank loans, which vary from day to day, at their basic interest rate.
The interbank interest rate, which varies from day to day, was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has increased to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis of the summer, the sums put into circulation by the Bank of England have been linked to penalties which the banks had withheld from using them.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many suggested signing for the sums put into circulation by the European Central Bank at more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the groups UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures which had been adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which were 50% on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPFlottante, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered some heated exchanges of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances, which had been examined by the Assamblee last week.
A New Festival Is Born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presenters, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 announced on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most prestigious festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio the Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event he has ever attended, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work side by side to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working diligently with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Regrettably, we have been stuck in political debate on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the 2005 Lollapalooza Festival in Grand Park Chicago, after it was profiled in the world of the festival in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax credits.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas ours is more of an urban green area," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is one way or another to merge these two concepts into one another, in order to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and an urban in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to host a festival which will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the reception capacity of the festival is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock attempts are part of the delegation tasks.
A political "heikles mandat" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Governator"?
"You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the main priority is to present the cinema there at the moment.
The Oscars have begun to hunt.
At all festivals on the West Coast, although that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is there an end-year rally on the stock exchange? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks until the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already pulling their hands with regard to the coming annual rally.
Nevertheless, the experts are not able to draw up safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistical, the month of December on the stock exchange usually coincides with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not approve of such a strong price increase in the last weeks of the year, they nevertheless note that the market price is determined by the liquidity given to the market and the market participant. These invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which are heavily affected by the upward trend.
According to these experts, the stock exchange will therefore have a rather lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible fall in the US bank's interest rate, an uncertainty due mainly to the increase in the crude oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daunting time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its highest mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant made at that time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasises that this year things could develop somewhat differently, especially due to the end-year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, the price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at an almost technical level, which could result in a deviation from the index values which depend on the impact of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree on the selection of the values to drive the Ibex to new levels.
Solana of Intermoney means that this year the great values are on the line.
Among the value winners, the expert would count the two major banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha from Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACPs have been on a catch-up course in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same course, according to the expert.
With regard to increased consumption during the Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the year by periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December showed only two declines in the course of the course.
When the technology bubble burst at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and simultaneously initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
The fact that 2008 will be the fifth year in a row (the Ibex has been increasing by 8.36%) and an annual rally will also show up.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Mondays to Fridays 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these offices represent a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group, the jump dares to extend the opening hours of its branches from 10h to 20.30h on Saturdays.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet reached a definitive decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with the trade unions seem to be aimed at reaching an agreement which will close 75% of all branches on Saturdays and open up to them on a weekday afternoon, albeit not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, will depend on the experience of the Popular Bank.
And that is precisely the intention that the popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches which, due to their location, can cover the buying-in customership of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening hours.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while at the same time aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the expansion of opening hours is linked to a new spatial design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require any major investment, but involved an increased staff position, since a branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The offices of the streets of Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular is currently looking for about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocrat. These are specialized on immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones with the help of external banking personnel.
The Spanish private channel Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus overtakes its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the managing director of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The transmitter he was conducting had increased its value by twice its rival Antena 3.
However, one aspect dampened his joy: That’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too low.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento participating only with 13%.
The Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so that its market value amounts to 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies is rising; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and in the case of Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, Vasile said.
Uncertainly, the question remains, to what extent we can actually operate on the stock exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to increase the first television channel with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue this year, which assured Guiseppe Tringali, the Managing Director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project were to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million in the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the stock market (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better exchange performance is the analysts at the high payout ratio, which the company was able to show up to the present time: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría's company led a 100 percent dividend distribution.
Vasile, however, assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, the ratio may still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always indicated much more.
I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of Endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing some losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
It also reduced Antena 3's expected profit calculation by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.

The Congress agrees with the directive of the MIFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with the parliamentary drafting, which ended today with the Senate Congress Decision on the additional/amendment applications relating to the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of Congress and Senate members, who, in their negotiations and votes, had the aim of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure investor safety and regulate individual entrepreneurial activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition to the modernisation of financial markets, the MIDI, which re-sets the Securities Services Regulation, is seeking to improve investor protection, increase the control requirement of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows financial advice to be offered to specialised companies as well as to natural or legal persons, and also contributes to the creation of new financial services companies (ESIS), to consultancy companies that associate themselves with the investment and brokering companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction execution systems so that regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral trading systems and to the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually enter into competition with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their corporate profile, confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate their control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently provided for further changes, with the decision that the titled bond must now be considered as complex financial resources to the investor due to its high level of risk, confirmed by the US mortgage and banking crisis (US mortgage crisis).
In addition, the entry into force of the directive on the legal limitation of the work of diplomats was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation was adopted, which restricted the work areas reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for commercialisation of products and for customer acquisition at the same time several investment companies.
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (VPI) increased by five tenths in November and now stands at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate in the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to make local and quality comparisons with US products through the provision of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by using the same approach as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time by using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the indicator identified in advance would only serve as a benchmark and therefore would not have to be consistent with the final result announced next 14 December.
The Consumer Price Index (IPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November , while at the same time ensuring that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless , Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current figure is not good , the inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced in view of the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has dropped by more than half after the Bank had asked for emergency credit from the UK bank in mid-September of last year, and by now it is only GBP 12,000 million (this is EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to £25,000 million in record terms, a sum that has fallen significantly within two and a half months due to customer confidence loss and, despite the government's 100% guarantee that the money is safe, will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after taking over under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to raise about a quarter of the British banks' income, which will be made up of the plants over the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to channel 50,000 million pounds (corresponding to around 70 million euros) annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock appointed the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are still involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the city of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented Juan Morales' office last May, currently a member of Partido Popular and at that time chairman of the Municipal Council of Totana, and could be, according to information from the Cadena SER radio station, the original draftsman of the plot.
Officials will continue to search the business records of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and will not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales accused the main suspect of urban corruption, discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales on leaving his client's residence was arrested on the basis of important burdensome documents that should be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information report the alleged payment of Morales' orders to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of an urban contract, in which it was decided to build a 200-hectare area.
At present, eight people are under investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidacy of the PSOE in Toledo and to take the fall of an election victory at Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will therefore include the list of PSOE candidates in the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory by the Socialists, will take over the office of the Congress President.
So it announced José Blanco, Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the headquarters of the party.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former ministers is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Moreover, in the event of a victory for the socialists in the forthcoming elections, the Mancha politician would appear to be running for the party as chairman of the Congress.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who announced last November 15 that he would no longer take part in the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take up his place in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the government president had been continually pushing for his return to political action.
He also pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the vice-president of the economy, did not want to dissuade citizens from taking over the post of Congress President in the event of an election victory, and referred to this as an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to transform the Chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or of history, so that they may appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Regrettably, from time to time you get the impression that the only place you can't talk quietly and calmly in Madrid is the Congress; so the government president was interrupted in the Senate up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President, Manuel Martín, and his good work and indicated that he did not want to raise the appearance of having already taken over the office, as otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate is criticising both the skeptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of this, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of the President of the Government, Zapatero, believes the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, puts it in need of clarification regarding the action or non-action of its government, which has contributed decisively to Spain being at the forefront of the countries that have least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the failure to meet the requirements, to which sectors this is due, and why has his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to explain to Spanish citizens the measures it has planned to take against climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures must be implemented and what economic consequences result.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be taken against climate change in real terms are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE appeared to Zapatero strategically so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. pure propaganda and empty sayings without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the otherwise suitable politician for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse, nor demand, but instead follow the demanding edition to decorate the meetings and inspire others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and thus does not imply that the bike will become the only means of transport in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with one compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana because of alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were taken into custody because of the suspected suspicion of urban crimes, it was now called by investigators.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where it was taken to the municipal office and in its premises until this time, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and at the municipal construction line Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flags already held in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid last Monday, where it appeared that more than 2 million hectares of unsolicited land for urban projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria should be reorganized. This should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration has received illegal commissions during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and conducted by the first court of Totona.
The first six prisoners have been introduced to the judge today.
According to investigators, the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP member Juan Morales is also being determined.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend, who lives in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria group, the Vigo lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have served as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crime, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 more searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, which should have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria assembly was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia area, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of land in Totana, which was to be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the field of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializing in the promotion, sale and installation of components.

If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to invent a price label of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsingin Sanomat (Finland, by the way, is at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the note published in the same newspaper, on 18 November; by chance on that day, whose issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The contents of the subject of philosophy have become the subject of public debate after the tragedy over the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abituant who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsche in his news.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairperson of the Board of Education for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, invited teachers to take a more critical position with regard to Plato and suggested that Plato's teaching be removed from the sub-level curriculum for philosophy in high school.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal code:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law, which will be dealt with with with with six months of imprisonment.
But once again, if you rob a music business of a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, theft is classified as a crime, but the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you close a car and give it back forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a beating than to participate in a music data exchange.
A prison sentence of three to 12 months follows (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while data exchange results in a withdrawal of freedom of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyright-protected films, whose authoring has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has quite screwed up his demands.

My family doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of them.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly salary pay depend on the salary of colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of the Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, activation was the strongest if the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers were able to see that the brain activities were always very moderate when both participants were correct with their answer and thus received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The State Attorney from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been inexorably after the crimes of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Her mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the chief culprits of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the time of the death of eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - namely the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the loose.
Their names are on the list of directors from Switzerland Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet started in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, pursues the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in its project of tracking the escaped criminals and putting pressure on the respective governments to tighten up their networks.
Which insurance is best for me?
The motor vehicle insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost, the amount of which again depends on different factors, such as age, gender, the date of issue of the driver's licence, family status, the type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear about what we're dealing with here.
Auto insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of an insurance contract, which shall determine that the company receives the insurance premium agreed upon and shall, in return, be obliged to submit the corresponding sum of compensation in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance consisting of several factors, such as age, gender, date of issue of the licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also made in the event of a higher risk of accidents.
For this reason, both over 25-year-olds and women have to make fewer contributions because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since, according to the statistical values and thus also according to the company's conviction, they tend to be less accidents than single persons.
The benefits to the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In drawing up the premium, insurance must take into account a whole range of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points to consider when choosing insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds face numerous obstacles when choosing a low-priced insurance policy, such as low driving practices and young driving licences.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to complete full insurance, there are nevertheless cheaper alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-time checkout with self-participation, so that the benefits of full-time insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay part of the amount resulting from the damage himself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, an intermediary for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance, which assures the customer against external damage, but not against the damage caused on his own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
When you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit will increase by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate for the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the rates indicated.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a lucrative year behind it, it may be possible to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. Reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Thus, it is most appropriate to opt for full-time insurance with self-share.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish president of the European company and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been eliminated.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to take out full insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of insurers, couples with children are considered to be customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contributions are also low.
In this case, full insurance with self-employment (with an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance policy is recommended, which only applies to the third vehicle year.
They are generally more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is possible to take out full-time insurance with self-employment (for an amount of 150 euros) or an extended insurance which only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
In the end, one must note that car insurance is very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it involves high costs, which require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the eighth finale in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point in San Siro next Tuesday in order to achieve their respective goals before the final round of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to get to the top of their group while they decide on their participation with the Scots.
The Italian team already has five points and have confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up with the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two Group D games will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan will have to take part in the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will compete for the final in the 13th semi-final for the first time in the 16th.
So this group will be finished before all the others and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the overall expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would have a better starting position in the eighth finale in the event of a victory.
The team of Gordon Strachan might even have a defeat at a slack of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. Nevertheless, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points of equality the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but were able to win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanese will try to avoid the Scots in the evening. Again, they hope for the second consecutive time to reach the eighth finale of the remodeled Champions League, after they were defeated in the previous season by a goal of Kaka in the replay time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the play.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the Rossoneri victory, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both reaching the eighth final and joining the UEFA will depend on its victory and defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus take part in the UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls launched their first tour after the release of the band in 2000 in the Canadian Vancouver in front of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in the reunited band was outstanding.
Around 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the sold-out stadium, where a video on the story of the band, which caused terror at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunion and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore on stage golden bracelets that the husband of Posh Spice, English footballer David Beckham, had given them before.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who made the GM Palace glow, even though the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham told us that the British star didn't get to see our wardrobe once, and that's why I'm really excited about what he's going to think about.
Sporty Spice , whose leaving the group in 1998, due to internal disagreements two years later followed the dissolution of the group , expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I thought why not; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said about the separation of the band she had caused nine years ago.
The singer was also told that the disputes had been resolved and that they were all very happy again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special machine by Virgin Airlines, reported by the TV station CTV.
Upon their arrival at the airport, the band was received by a army of nanny.
The five have seven children together.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will appear next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23rd.
New concerns about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute erodes between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk that Russian exports of fuel will be affected to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are managed by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is observed very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
An earlier conflict between the two states last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said Ukraine's economic minister Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters news agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] on Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas is one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas deposits, but much of them remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve checks on the criminal record of workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in Zusammenhang with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish public health service did not have a precise idea of the number of his foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The principal financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission at Old Bailey in October and was charged with the suspected car bombing in the UK.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks in advance of the employment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review criminal records, the Agency does not have the competence to obtain this information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Management Board should take up guidelines on criminal records that help employers in checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel documents, they have not been carried out routinely."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would closely follow their investigation guidelines prior to the appointment, but added: "Our report identifies areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health service staff is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations prior to the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report states that the NHS Scotland's current pre-production tests are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the board of directors had problems identifying those employees who were left for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation continued to show that established control procedures have been largely complied with by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
These include passport, work permit and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Nicola Sturgeon, Secretary of Health, said: "It was my concern to carry out this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations would be reflected in advance of the recruitment of all employees - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five prizes at the British Independent Film Festival, among other things for the best movie.

The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's playing thriller Easter Promises in London.
Ray Winstone, who is called to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuance The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize that was named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prizes, known as biphas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned an impending attack on an oil plant as well as on clerics and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaeda have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong fast Eingreif troops to protect plants following a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to a declaration by the Minister for the Interior, says that 18 of the prisoners were part of a cell led by a "racet expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the detainees were prepared to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned clergy to do more to stop Saudis who are striving for Iraq to join Al Qaida militias who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government who are considered heretical by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia to target the pro-Western Saudi government - have disregarded foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a very great effort by the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman from the Ministry of the Interior told the government television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners were also 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship located on a orbit show that the planet resembles an averted twin of the earth even more than was previously known.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
Billions of years ago there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on earth and could have even been habitable, scientists believe today.
But due to the unbraked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rate of rotation, Venus entered a completely different development course.
Today the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which examined the plants for one year, offer a sobering look at how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario in which Venus began billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police officer said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything's still open.
With Romey said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the presidency to put a debate on YouTube, record questions on video in normal voters, and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party that is breaking up in the elections next year.
It is not known just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the selection of YouTube clips to show to the upcoming candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the centre of the debate.
The topic is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a voter when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed peaks of approval when the candidates spoke strictly about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake the reputation that he was careful about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly disputing as questioners as to whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, managed to pick up on this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have earlier and harder than others on the immigration joke.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates generally share the same views: stronger borders, intolerance towards illegal migrants.
This issue, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
One of the questions asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - contrary to all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to support them, Jesus laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's ascent in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his applause storms in Wednesday's debate.
These two have been shot out of nowhere, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly clever.
No title seems to be sold, no politician pays Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes have been sucked.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has donated to the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the contested Gordon Brown.
When, two months ago, the Prime Minister had withdrawn his request for an election, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that polls had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once-feared Brown from Stalin to Mr Bean has evolved.
The unskillful rescue of Northern Rock, a beaten bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by the tax authorities of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative pfuseries.
A trio of retired generals started a riot in the upper house from protesting against cuts in military expenditure: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed, is a part-time job.
Now there are the numerous donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former head of fulfillment) has already resigned.
None of it means that Brown ceases to resign irrevocably.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it impossible to rule.
Neither do people like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new force seizes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not even have to be there for long, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to be leaked; the cabinet ministers are starting to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is becoming defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new broom.
As much as he'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant in charge.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's mishap - like the long "money for title" examination of political party financing - voters may assume that it was him.
But Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely defrauded.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new set of political donations is a good example.
The Garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision about it did not allow him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who said he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief finance manager, who was told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered down this determination by grasping a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to make the measure full, led by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "learnings to be drawn out" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progressing with a thorough reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and possibly abandon the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party comrade like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear lead in the polls; they have two years to win back voters; and the only way to achieve a victory is through indisputable justice and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is the credit crisis America's credit card market on?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fins swirl around excitedly.
Now that America's real estate market is in trouble, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Analysts from Goldman Sachs expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of contamination of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of the tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the outlays and in the bond rates, which measure the share of loans that are not repayable or more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it has taken a 1.4 billion dollar fee collection from its US consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and seams are still low.
According to Moody's rating agency, the third-quarters serum rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which in turn represent a large part of credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus penalty fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate or not.
The industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of their debts consumers pay off each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels exist between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debts, now that home loans are drying out.
However, card exhibitors look at the flow of money instead of capital, so falling house prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the borrower.
You can even be of benefit to card exhibitors.
Incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates decline when the real estate is less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt under the repayment priorities becomes more important.
Card exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexibly than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
"We won't wake up one day and revalue the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's Chief Financial Officer.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable downturn are much more real.
If lower house prices and a credit reduction push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers confess guilty in the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be brought before the court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former chief finance manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their application to the court on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing in court before U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK during extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, her case is a loose end to an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The allegations originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the goal of a government investigation in connection with the Enron downfall.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim that they came to Houston in 2000 to hedge out a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron transactions that have helped to tear the company into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had real value.
A company under Koper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely advised Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others sacked about 12.3 million dollars, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed in two counts of conspiracy for his role in Enron's riot.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is in Louisiana Federal Prison for six years.
Kopper spends three years and one month in a Texarkana facility.
Each of the three men was free of charge on the basis of a $1 million deposit that required them to live in the United States in anticipation of the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, collapsed in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer mask billions of debt or make dwindling businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in the Enron crash.
Skilling executes a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were nullified after he died last year of heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's change for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you is asking for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaires exhibition, a four-day orgy of displayed consumption, which was held in a shacked exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest new money-created Russians in everything, from mahogany-squatted yachts to diamond-covered autogrills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously visited a shiny orange Porsche at the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but it's small compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas in its heydays.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe in crowds, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arab overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear to be the world's most liberal money publishers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the gold rush.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-kept, and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they move through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed primarily to target the new empires, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in storage for several hours to visit a slippery warehouse, which invariably put Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears side by side.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically seated at a booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of sober brand with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people pushed through the halls every day, whether millions, millions of messengers, or simply tourists.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here said he had sold two 70,000 dollar mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with stitched gold threads.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company that has high-end cars with high-end alarm systems had sold the giant orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer's wishes, said that he had sold three car cooler grilles for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, the same pair of chain straps, for each $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car tire developed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: $22,000 for a fourth.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants to have ostrich wheels or a picture of his wife's face made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-car garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in the local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a stand run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were stuffed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 wrong banknotes for the millionaire trade fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around the money piles, mobile phone photos, while they lean back in the midst of the spare wealth, get caught by friends, or just put in a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Mistaked operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the white Cape Cod kept two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the doctor's bodyguard coming in," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to find out if she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked in the house on West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and persistent," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the options," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have communicated little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a parched rose tree stands in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian calls behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was sitting in the parking lot next to a door leading to the ground floor.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him find his way into the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that,' he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to an increase in world stock markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rate cuts, strengthened by reassuring comments from the US Central Bank Vice President.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2, said Ben Bernanke, president of the Central Bank, had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm up tiring markets, in the face of signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped to calm down Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record level in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global employees, in a cost reduction measure to offset severe losses from their lost bets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289.40, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of UK standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emergence of credit printing on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank, which was granted to the European trading banks, was granted at a significant 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed further capital into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" rate of loan between UK banks rose by 6.59% to its highest since late September, after a continuous increase since November 21.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owai Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's gonna beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is going to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election chairman, is on call at least under this special title, here to help the chief coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing director, gradually fills itself with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for those in part-time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth bat position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail exactly what enables a person to reach the tip of his profession, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes out of lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket, where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same can perhaps also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good finishes who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a major influence on decisions, but chances also have.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the right time, if he can take a wicket and a batter has to get regular chances of order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who is apparently going to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harrison declares himself to be healthy and how the wind is squeaking into the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a point of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to strengthen himself, who made the breakthrough into a significant test-kricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, is still perhaps underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and gut feelings for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network meeting at the Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his stroke, which was still apparent in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex all-rounder enjoys life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket spot and his attitude was brought to the point when he recently had a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Did you see this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he cones his mid-tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit to him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn't mean that Shah might not be there well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a flow of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, with regard to the Shiite militias of militant clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his powers to be restored at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqis was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States has helped to expel Al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who had been driven out of his house in Sleikh in the north of Baghdad by a hand grenades attack after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaedas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing tranquillity in the capital since the US increase in troops and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", who, in cooperation with the American military, defend their neighborhood.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and devastating funds in Damascus, where over 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three times, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged the Iraqis no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will create sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is the leader in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarlands express the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared to a non-Saarian for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest federal state for its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, which is in fifth place in the education monitor of the Institute of the German Economy Cologne (IW).
The universities thus already cooperate closely from tradition with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring Saarland in an above average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland, the vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every five young people acquire their right to study at a vocational school, which means that the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined possibilities of vocational and academic training are also relatively extensive.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"After the first Pisa study, we started several reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced nationwide comparative tests.
In order for the children to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copy other federal states.
Whether pupils' performance improves sustainably will only show future comparative studies.
At Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal states.
Bayern's better off.
And to the detriment of the Saarland countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area one could otherwise point.
For the language of the neighbours is compulsory to high school, even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will be ticking differently soon than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez will have the timepieces in the South American country turned back by half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Official Journal of Venezuela, a new law states that the clocks will be adjusted to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez based his decision, among other things, on the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division into time zones to full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the termination of relations with neighbouring Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage affair.
The Left Nationalist said that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not have relations with the Head of State or with the Colombian Government.
"I cannot do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is driving forward a constitutional reform on which the citizens of Ölande have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The cause of the dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "spucked his face" with his decision, Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chávez is in all mouths.
A new cell phone ring in the country makes for fear: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you keep your mouth shut) is the sentence that has already been downloaded from the Internet for more than half a million people.
He spoke to King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-America summit had been bothered by the constant intercessions of the left-wing populist and had crossed his mouth.
Germans threaten 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong economic climate, German workers are forecasting a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees could really count on less in the salary account than in the previous year.
"This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price shift in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "Picture" magazine.
New burdens could also be placed on workers in unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year was true and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Employment Agency should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants from the federal government, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and oil products has driven inflation to the highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0 per cent in the year.
Venus is the hellish twin of the earth
In spite of its anti-lifelike atmosphere, Venus is more similar to that of the earth: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind vortex to the Poles, as they occur on earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that Venus is flashing.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory", lightning has created life on earth: thunders are said to have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If ever there was life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly any living thing on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's twin of the earth, but it's a twin," Russel said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the Earth in mass and size, has such a completely different development taken place, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s no more probes have been on the way to research this planet.
According to the researchers, the latest research results now presented in several "nature" articles underline not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the earth are greater than initially assumed," the Esa announces.
In addition to the already known whirlwind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second inner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening star, circles around the sun in just under 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: A Venus Day takes 243 Earthdays.
Although Venus hardly reminds of the Earth with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and 92 bar pressure, scientists assume that both planets were created under quite similar conditions.
Both gathered water that remained on earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth in carbonate rocks, on Venus it makes up most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and has invited the great coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but took Merkel into protection from the accusation that she was running a new China policy.
"The Chancellor did not distance himself from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect dismay at the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from rows of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's "window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the chancellor's office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
In this way, not only has the Chinese leadership released the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries, according to the information provided by the SPIEGEL.
China's head of government Wen Jiabao has now asked Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama's reception as a mistake.
China denies it when European politicians officially receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which includes other present provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France
Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being unleashed in violence on the streets, the Federal Minister for the Interior demanded.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shotguns: Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany after the heavy youth gangs in France.
"We need to make sure that we do not build up and release social explosives in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said, the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person copes with the rapid change of social reality.
Federal, state and local authorities have already worked hard to alleviate problems, said Schäuble.
This was not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, this already shows first successes."
However, it was too early for de-warning.
Schäuble also pointed out that in German suburbs there were no urban and sociological problems as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people in the past nights had suffered heavy street battles with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
However, greater integration efforts by the Federal Government called for the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the crash in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany was not as fragile as in France.
But there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migrant background below 25 years of age is above average.
More training places had to be provided in particular.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "social control in the families takes place".
Moreover, many young people with migrant backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given the "fast opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained largely quiet during the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of the police were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with headlamps.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning bins and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces has been providing for peace.
The police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On the night of Tuesday, about 80 policemen had been injured at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following eight years, unrest took over Toulouse.
The Krawalls were inflamed by a traffic accident that had killed two young people on Sunday.
The police are not responsible for the death of the young people after the initial findings of the prosecutor's office.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The chancellor's real-life appearance documents that the coalition is at the end of its content - and that there is nothing to be expected of it.
In which country does this Chancellor actually live?
After her restless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was wretched and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country which should finally be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel rejected the allegation that she was too focused on foreign policy with an extremely high rate.
It is provincial, she said, and first showed that she does not want to understand what the critics are all about.
In the Bundestag it has clearly documented to everyone how much their accusations apply.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: an eloquent politician who flees into foreign policy and himself remains in trouble there.
For example, climate protection: it praises the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve climate goals here.
At all, the self-loathing - so much insolence would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she clings to the flakes that the upswing comes to the people.
In doing so, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems rather than discuss the world beautifully.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of the lowly ones?
She's got a few extras left for it.
It is significant how often it promises itself when it comes to child care.
Three approaches are needed by Merkel to produce a half-way straight set.
She stumbles like on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Division
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a hard-hit exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The suspense of the candidates is already revealed at the first topic.
He has turned New York into a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants" and has launched his opponent Rudy Giuliani with Romney.
This counters with serious accusations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegal," Giuliani countered and accused the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users have transmitted via YouTube are hardly more than just passwords.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain accuses his opponent Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives strong reading from the Vietnam veterans of the Levites when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method in which drowning is simulated as torture.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq's war and torture debates shows the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
When conservative values are always praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium will appeal.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, "and in front of the base and the television audience, he said he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to the conclusion that he is being asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civil
One day after his resignation as Head of Army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraf was defended as President.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistani television gave the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had surrendered his office as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus declined international pressure, especially from the USA.
Eight years after his seizure of power in an unbloody military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will, according to Advocate General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him after the imposition of the state of emergency at the beginning of November, had rejected all opposition to the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy and four more were injured.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of Krautrock Return
Germany's Supergroup of the Seventies is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia once again took up their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
==References====External links==* Official website
They were already much more famous abroad at the time.
The special sensation then occurs in the form of three set gentlemen at the dinner table.
Everyone has his box in front of him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the flower white shirt at 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
On the right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focuses on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to be a big problem for the gentlemen themselves.
The band Harmonia's music again has caused some excitement among herbrock lovers.
In which one can reveal here: Targeted demands revealed that the name was hurled through collective pop memory, but by no means so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially in England and America, what is called misleading herbrock was always more popular than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for Life's Works to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Laudatio, the surprise did not know any limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later rocked the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the foreign world is one.
The memory is already superfluous with harmony because the trio existed for only two years and during that time also developed a much lower power of effect than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already performed with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Afterwards in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a record label entertained by the Church.
Rother had briefly helped out at Kraftwerk and then became a guitarist at Neu!, at that time perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruins dating back to the 16th century, they lived as a city-run city.
Less ideological than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague himself as a nanny.
It's more like a crazy artist's life.
It is said that a moustache of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and for art also found a name.
Some of them held harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so quiet and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The rice collection did not serve the sole purpose of self-discovering.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a 50-member record set, as someone thinks to be.
From Rother came the desire to pursue harmony and occasionally practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric Spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than it ever was in Harmony.
The Grimessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of harmony takes place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Old Punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
Which would outline the entire range of influences of the herb rock on the following pop music.
Harmonia will fill in the void of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno hovers with the most extraordinary sounds in the hall: "The only true music you have is the future."
There are images showing the producers with harmony in the farmhouse.
The legend is used for projections of other black and white photos of wired devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unlock the instruments via self-contained effects devices unheard of sounds.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the Technically Intensified Tuftler.
The choir of the house doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensstern, the sound clouds are coughed and whispered and sung in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were searched for less in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (power station) or on the run from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Anyone who calls here "'68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmony can't now get away with it.
The most obvious thing is carefully considered on stage.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can bring great happiness to one’s nerves or fleeting moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murdererischer Frieden" two films deal with the Balkan war again.
But they're not both convincing.
Either the concepts rely too much on action and baller or they are too stirring.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnia War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many nice and unimportant roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on Buddhism have driven you to look forward.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (Why do film titles actually have to be as long and we have to look at themselves as locomotive tariff agreements today?).
He provides a wonderful eye-catching presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been done if fate and the film industry were not so gracious: a man who has his very best times behind him for a long time, but who himself has preserved, as a ruinous monument to his decline, considerable remains of the former charm.
But despite this trump "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Murdererischer Frieden", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films continues.
"Murder peace" can be a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbin from Kosovo's hedge protectors, to which one immediately falls in love with them.
Although it is welcome that not even the Serbs are represented here as the sole root of all evils, the telescopic film loses all too quickly in baller and action.
There remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be exemplified, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to track down the Serbian upper-war criminal "the fox" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in the personal union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are very striking: both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military can't do, and both times it's going to be a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the downfall cynic with heart as he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script also has to conjure up a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream if the reporters succeed in the time-lapse process within the last five minutes, what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to justice.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against the cinema.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to argue that Karadzic and Mladic are still running around freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to agree) not too intensely to pursue the persecution on the basis of secret political agreements.
But the good mean and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into the mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's desk: "I see with compassion the swollen styrades, meaning: how strenuous it is to be evil."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same swelling heads, but they suggest how strenuous it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, in this newspaper, it has been reported that all of the Iraq films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star is drifting around the world's crisis herds or minefields, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Jensenits all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bludiamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with "Skindler's List".
Some films are likely to ripen - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" that are now considered to be classics have never been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home on two screens in real time, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the screenwriters of the carefreeness they need to tell good stories.
After all, "his or nothing" or "The Great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcasticly distanced artist's view of the Romancian Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked in parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be cruelly murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Beust reaps criticism for Olympic Absage
The departure of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Summer Olympics has been a major criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But by Beust, realism urges in assessing the chances.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, said on Wednesday that "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed as much motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, the sport policy vibration would not be maintained to the same degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project but to find a new long-term approach to "a change of time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust continued to state that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportbund on an application for the 2018 Winter Games in Munich, expected for the beginning of December.
"This preference means to us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period we have planned until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreaming for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to compete for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by burying the plans already at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application also contradicts the statement made by the head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception at the General Meeting of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust described Hamburg's application for the Universiade 2015 as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Hochschulsportverband had not nominated Hamburg as a candidate city until last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group accused the Senate of not using valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and excluded the construction of housing," said SPD members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD had always demanded integrated planning for Olympia and later housing for the Little Grassbrook, the CDU had put one-sided on the "Event Factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics had given rise to a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Those who connect the terms Sweden and wooden box think of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's catalogue.
Most of the twenty-four Brillo boxes listed there by "Typ Stockholm" are fakes.
After a few months of doubting the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now coming to a sobering conclusion: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has done as a gift to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and probably most of the approximately one hundred other Brillo-boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is shattered, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the "Brillo" soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet 1968, with Warhol's consent, exhibited hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, they were mere pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which, however, were not issued in the Moderna Museet.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen crates, which at that time have rightly been incorporated into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100 000 dollars at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, and that Warhol had then left it to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the Swedish private holdings in addition to the six museum's own Brillo-Boxes, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press strips were first grounded and smelted, after which white oil was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel with a paint roller without primering - and this is not about oil paint, but about acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would follow the "serious accusations" raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
But since then one has been hiding there in unswerving silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have abandoned themselves in a hotel in Manila, demanding the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer bloodshed, said leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters in the hotel.
Government-faithful soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly settle down with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to guard him, apparently had crossed over to him and joined his mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked up the district around the main hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Consultant Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Their government has been overshadowed by accusations of corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of attempted mutiny by about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The uprising failed after almost 24 hours of the army's refusal to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
20.05 percent of the capital is now held.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option is left open to increase the share of Versatel.
The step is to drive forward the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet announced.
On Wednesday, there had already been a start on suspicions after the Berenberg Bank increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house held the shares only for a third party, it was called the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet had already participated in the Drillisch mobile company with almost 10 percent.

5.15 million shares of which United Internet has bought for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies have entered into discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," explained a United-Internet speaker.
The two companies set up the joint venture MSP to take over the competitors Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of more than ten percent in Freenet and not make use of their right to acquire another 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to further increase all options, in particular their participation in Freenet AG.
Discussions between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-November.
The persistent and difficult-to-understand poker around Freenet for months is part of the consolidation of the German Telekom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
So far, United Internet and Drillisch's holding held 6.01 percent of the freenet shares.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another around four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
