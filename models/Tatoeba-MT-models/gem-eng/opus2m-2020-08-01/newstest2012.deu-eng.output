No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced, as a result of a revision of the Criminal Code.
The new regime, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-Prime Minister, was rejected by Members at the second reading of the request to alleviate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in October for the conclusion of an allegedly adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet enforceable; in December the appeal of the defendants to the Court of Justice is to be negotiated.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised the suspicion of preconception of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was condemned to be removed from the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 MEPs.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Sieg
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the victors are to be defined.
As usual in this region, in the elections Islamists win, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the right of habit of the Sharīʼa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for theft one briefly hacks off the hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any faith abductions are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will in future be united by the Koran from interdependent tribes.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imagined here and above all hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively seen either and would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were helped by the infidel dogs at all.
To their apologies, only the fact that NATO's air raids were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The victors in Libya?
We only took part in a shot change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without that having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are concerned - namely the expulsion of the cruisers.
But do the oil companies get the black gold at the spot price without an occupation?
It is hardly possible for the West to boast once and for all of its selflessness in protecting human rights.
If they do not destroy this, the Sharīīa-representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in focus by investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm broke through Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
Today, however, the bond market breaks down all records.
Investors not only keep an eye on Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to rise by 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared with the previous year.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend of growth slowing economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of the year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
Preliminary and seasonal data show that the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Throughout the eurozone and the EU, between July and September, the economy recorded growth of 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on its 10-year government bonds increased the value of 28.45%.
The return on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to experience problems...
The return on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are loud, the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well laid out goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from home play and will once again not be missing at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascent game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of Jiráček's day in Montenegro, the Czech selection also won a very happy 1:0 and thus paid their ticket for the football EM.
They also put more pressure on the Montenegrins only in the second half of the year because of the precise defense game of the Czech team.
The bad birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be joining the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the local football team will receive a prize of about 200 million.

Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
In the second half, too, the pressure of the home team remained, and the large reductions in the penalty area were successfully prevented by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core program of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's nuclear programme before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed before the object on Tuesday afternoon and then announced death to the USA and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a live shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
By doing so, they wanted to know that they were willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary also with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had apparently not abandoned a nuclear weapon after its efforts.
In Israel, too, there is talk of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear installations.
Students had prayed to the complex at noon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, if the Iranian nuclear program were to be halted as far as possible, the attack target of the Isfahan Center would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Nathan's attack.
The menu of a obese child: it does not breakfast and eats to the dinner sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the environment in which he grows up and is the examples surrounding him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages stand up to half more often on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before, under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence".
In families with Dickerchen also sports are not just one of the favorite jobs, however, as far as the majority of today's students are concerned - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools surveyed throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Fund and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of overweight or even obesity children.
"Only half of the children interviewed, for example, suggested eating breakfast-second breakfast-vesper dinner in five times a day - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the pupils' families had breakfast.
And - in most families everyone breakfasts for themselves.
The worst was the finding that is not cooked at all in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that many times unhealthy fries are consumed in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - without regard to weight - drinks sweet lemonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed do sports, only less than half of their parents do so - that is, only 15 percent.
Generate your own menu
A further part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), from the opportunities offered, according to appetite and opinion, to compile their own menu.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades", is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, doughnuts won just before poultry.
The children almost didn't like legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Turning to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In many cases, a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition has been mentioned in the results of the project, among the survey participants' control group, which completed the questionnaire after completing the informative presentation "Adipositas is not a coincidence".
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
In the questionnaire the children also crossed much more often poultry or fish as the main course of the day and were willing to eat less noodles or sweet foods.
Claiming professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I had a little tasted that this was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the square" runs.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the test moves, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (no man takes part in the course) how to dress a woman who has no ideal proportion figure.
And at least that's most of us.
One has a short neck, the other one too young without proper curves and others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually cascade wide shoulders, extend the neck or create the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with big busts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure betonite, without making it too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or trousers really don't fit, you should at least have a piece cut to measure.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels much better than in one of the rods, which is always high and slippery, in the waist, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bows, applications, embroidery or refining.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week to let everything go down my head.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to make it in the light of the assigned housework.
Each of the students was awarded a prize, for which they should think of suitable outfits - day clothes and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who may know you from Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, for this is much better for me personally than to attract Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who in recent times has probably increased to the hundred kilos (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are to cut the clothes out of magazines or search, print, and then graphically edit them on the Internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should then be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit it.
And sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in quite different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, i.e. like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on your heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to shrink up the sleeves or collars and the whole look is very different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most came to me the following advice: "First, you must know the rules perfectly."
"First, you can hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we have to break all these teachings, what we can combine with what we can and why, even if we often get to see something different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all of this when designing the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half of the success confirmed to us also Jan Pokorný.
You just need to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known personalities often think this is money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look secondary).
And if any one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us on a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to make sure that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has re-entered or declined, etc.
Jan and Mario put our hearts to us on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then to "build up" the outfit.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people he stilutes and he must be a weaved psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing up to him.
"If any manager orders us to see their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can't clear her whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"At least you have to find some praiseworthy things to recommend to them what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that is tied to the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, peelers for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are rubbed in the back if it is too large (traps or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and, of course, sewing fabric.
But not only do we have to listen, but we can also try something practical, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, one can damage the sole of the shoe, silently outside.
We glued and glued...
With the scissors, you can't even touch the shoes so that you don't damage them.
So you really have to be smart.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was just the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to devote yourself to the styling on a professional level is not a children's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors to the routine journey to the early layer.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the barn tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" aroused high expectations.
He promised to re-move the already-eldered game series "Need for Speed" into a new dimension, and in the playable demonstrations, he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious as to how the passages that were fit into place, in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and continues on foot.
But how you get used to it at NFS is very different in the end effect than you expected.
Sure - potentially there are pretty decent arcade races, but overall the game is reduced by some superfluous errors that are present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it's actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time, one is introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, that is, on the west coast, you get on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is performed on a different route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One has no moment the impression that game would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing moving around the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deep snowy landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
Over and over, untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that greatly limits the view.
In the mountains again you must be careful that you are not wasted by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well installed in a row.
Although only a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect another personal duel with a single opponent.
And that's what the police are trying to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far less such passages in the game than one would expect (in concrete terms only three).
In the end, this is more beneficial because at least this element has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model steps into the footsteps of the previous parts.
In other words, from today's point of view, it does not rip out trees, but on the other hand one could not claim that it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations has to look elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be quite justifiable, although you could find better in competition.
Until then, everything is in good order.
Real problems only appear after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
A game of this kind can hardly be expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no impact on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is all right.
Typical example: When you overtake or overtake cars that are arriving, you "strip" the other cars easily in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into the sleuding and twisting wild pirouettes.
Or take the car straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter anymore, but it's always annoying.
The restarts are solved this way: if you have total damage or you land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last stop of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
Once you've exhausted it, it'll all start from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn't work, but you better not rely on them.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn't even help, as nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
Very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to go through some curves in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Otherwise, you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate location, whether you are coming first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when one sees that the opponent comes by in front of a playful two arriving cars, but until one arrives there, the cars are already in such a position that one has to bypass them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that it always comes close to this situation in front of your nose.
Contractors have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
At the craziest, this is at the end of the game on the long bridge that one happens in the opposite direction.
The contrahent must obviously overtake one of these devils.
And then if he's already in front of you, he'll take a look, of course, so you can start by driving your own car a couple of times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses you the joy at the game.
And that's a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game as a whole is quite entertaining and sometimes even so loaded up for action that you almost don't know where one of the heads is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is about - the concept of fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't cause boredom, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change of car during the race.
You can't ignore the gas stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just got is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical rides, for example on the Serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations known from history.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common to the tasks (challenges) and history.
To get to a higher driver level, different items have to be unlocked: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides for further collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible carpenters is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you come by car to a subway tunnel (roadway), where you rest on the rails in the dark for a long time (roadway).
On the Tacho look at numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (roadways), but there comes a subway from behind and drives a uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial team we will probably continue to argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the frequency of images is slowing down and sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, is particularly true of accidents involving a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound reproduction is as far as OK and the soundtrack is tasteful.
In an effort to address a young audience as wide as possible, a soundtrack a lay "of everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not thwarted by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared to put these faults in the eye with the power of airport lights.
Concert of the "Students of the Contemporary Revolution" with singing ensembles of Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festa Academica is now the third time that the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Samtenen Revolution and this, together with music experience, has been a success.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Euroskeptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has brought the balance between the individual institutions out of the lot."
I didn't expect such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years for the waves to smooth out and get used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply speaking at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "understandable and open about Europe" she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism was raised that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that it all breathed how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a human being who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and who, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, she then explained in response to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil cap quartel
Ms Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Union lived, lives and plans to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government's case during the Presidency was described as a major negative which had greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has all its hands to do.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes it much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and economical budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be more and which will be less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "understand Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's horrible shorts, foreign words and professional jargon that no one understands.
How am I supposed to know, as a citizen, whether you really think about crumbs or round cucumbers and different sizes of bananas in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban the quargel.
She would also have liked to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
A Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are called to be Eurosceptics who perceive more the negatives than the positives of the case.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakia is nearby, then the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you putting together your heads - is this your V4 again?" and makes a pretty angry smile.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU is looking forward to tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States in the future.
As a much more real, as a "European Federation", it sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Reinforced Cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries that want it to work together and those who don't want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong "Europe of different speeds", she expects.
In this respect, it also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues have to be discussed with an impact on the EU as a whole by all Member States and not just by the eurozone countries.
Fire Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a proper word that the strategy of IBM is the most precise, then this would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has been a century since its founding.
The basis for this longevity was already her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the hallmark to play on the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the internal magazine, which IBM started to publish in 1935).
This was also the basis of the well prepared corporate culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not deter it from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society in the course of our first century.
We hope that we will do even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Convenient system
Watson has already operated social care for his employees in the thirties - in a similar way to that of the entrepreneur Baña in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had a holiday paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful pay system for best new and best dealers.
Similarly, IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are also elucidated.
As one of the first companies in the world, IBM raised any discrimination from the very beginning, the company was ingenious in the promotion of talent and was able to choose it accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan at the top of IBM will be replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken up the position of Vetriebs-, Marketing- and Strategy Manager.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo because of its family called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have already received the Nobel Prize.
Its most well-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes or diskettes.
With around 220 billion dollars of market capitalization, IBM was the second largest technology company (similar to Apple) this year, and for the first time since 1996 it has overtaken Microsoft.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with its own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr computers.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so one must not emotionally bind to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In the winnings of IBM, most services, software and hardware are involved in one fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percent share was the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has been selling low-profit assets worth 15 billion dollars, but at the same time it has invested 58 billion dollars in purchasing future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Here, too, IBM remained faithful to the legacy of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the major global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today's crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent rocket-like since 2008 and the company's net profit has grown continental.
The company logo of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values can not be changed.
This is also why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to all-world flights
Founded one hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over only 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous card sequences to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the Supervisory Board until 1930, became the architect of this new company.
And it was Flint who hired the head of Thomas J. Watson's competition firm to help him manage the company.
This leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - based on Watson's ideas to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name reveals, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cashier.
In the first four decades of leading the company, Watson doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped manage NASA flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC that set the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus entered the business of consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned to date, such as improving the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform to help retailers lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
In 1932 IBM founded a branch in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe headquarters are located in Prague and there is also a world-wide top team of researchers dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful spouses:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - it's over now!
After her husband, Josef Rychtář (53), had become a lover of her by the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of her life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," D. Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, you wouldn't even have dreamed of what happened to her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back on her longings after 30 days, Joseph immediately went with him.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved them.
In time, Darina, yes, it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the run.
Rychytář doesn't care who's sleeping with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already separated herself emotionally from him and stood alone for mutual decency.
The fact that Darina had locked the back door for him, Joseph had been carrying dignity so far.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina I am having a normal time, we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he won't stop her from it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a friend or who is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female wrongdoers, what about you?
If you ask the men to call some typical female wrongdoers, they shake some of them out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsittered revues happen again, causing the men to spill the blood into the veins?
Purchasing
Does her husband propose to them to be a shopping man?
Do you have to buy at least one hader every week?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more in the case of actions?
Then, in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and are trying to keep their shopping a little bit under control.
But hand to heart, which woman is already able to walk in search of a well-sitting upper garment just so through a dress shop and not to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often pure hell.
Why don't you think about how many times she's told her husband?
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"I should lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do I even like you?"
Does this seem familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you will probably also be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to let go, but a lot of men react sensibly to when their wife constantly regrets her appearance.
The stronger gender is in agreement - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
First of all, order and cleanliness
It's a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, wiping tiles and dust, shoving the tub - and this at least twice a week.
If you squat with your partner, because he's trampling on clean tiles with dirty shoes again, you'll be shoving the kids because the just squatted sink is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has got fingerprints again, where the polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer under this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you can't exaggerate anything and that the order and cleanliness of family life are not the first priority.
This immeasurable purity can ultimately also damage mutual relations and, above all, the tranquillity of the family.
Tile
"Poor pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that will bring it to the palm.
Of course it's not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not have had to meddle so much.
Clapping and trampling
Some women would like to chat and chat, because behind their backs they are tangled or even slandered or forged alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to hate such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I guess each of us women have a little harmless clap and tramp in stock.
Hand to heart - this is probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with clatters of coarsest calibers, to which nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise anyone in their surroundings and who poses a considerable danger especially to women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
The ice hockey tower Jaromír Jágr, with two assistants, had a large share in the 5:3 win of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match, took advantage of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jagr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
After the game, Jágr told journalists that he had a great evening prophesied to Giroux.
"Just before the game, I'll tell him that he'll succeed in a hat today."
I kind of felt that."
"Hin and again such a feeling prevails," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fought the puck behind the Hurricanes gate and presented him to the successful Maxim Talbot between the circles.
A second before the debut of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jagr praised his center.
"I wouldn't have thought that when I finished my career, I would be playing with such an ice hockey player as he did."
"I'm thrilled."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my co-players set their game on me and now the spear turns around," said Jagr.
Carolina still made the play a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who got out of a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in excess of two against one.
"Excellent prongs were still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took the ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," Voráček described the last matches of the game from his point of view.
This victory brought Philadelphia to the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to his upper body.
In addition to their experience, the Candiens also fine Beck their leadership an unlost in Penalty shooting 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not change one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they only played with five defense players to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only played the meeting with one experienced player in the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to be done with," said Jacques Martin.
"When each change took place, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it."
"We should have made the game easier and brought the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec refused thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
At the time, the travel agencies sold only travel to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, and in the West they were only allowed to select.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even the citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered to travel to the west, but then they had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
This was not the case for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for an exit to the West - was granted only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to raise the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 Joint Revolution followed a revolution of the Czechs on their feet.
While a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their vacation abroad in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer known today, is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia by 1989 at all because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s, foreign exchange obligations were lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not get enough for a long time from their travels to the West, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
Thus the Czech holidaymakers slept in the park when traveling to Paris in the tent, because at the time who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of Czech travel abroad was at that time a boxroom filled with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of living and therefore the average salaries increased, which meant 1997 at another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agencies began to regularly prepare journeys through charter flights after 1997, making the flights incredibly cheaper, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already had currencyless payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-sammen" travel came in 2000, when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was completed in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying in far-off sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are being flown directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Czechs travel every year to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which made our country definitely among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 thousand CZK per head for a single holiday stay, including the cost at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again there is a threat.
For almost five months, the Czech football team has no chairman and threatens that Ivan Hašek's successor at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary Annual General Meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement as to which electoral system is to be elected.
And without this there is no vote on the three potential successors possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hašek resigned from his position, inviting his colleagues to join forces and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era of Hašek the old querels broke out between the two chambers of association again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This turned out to be clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the People's House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the negotiations resulted in no results and this was not just about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote at the plenary session - only the members of the assembly or the officials with a mandate.
At least a partial agreement was reached on this one point, and the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law also contributed, which, in the opinion of a representative on the basis of authority, was not valid.
However, disputes about the electoral system continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity into the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even though the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgical point remained the same.
The question is, how do you proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a pattern situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to a bet-making model, in the third round the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Ants are allegedly prepared to accept the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one-third of the votes cast in this percentage.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no meaning at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which found it best not to bend the electoral system, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik also agrees, even if it is noted that the electoral order of all candidates is probably the closest to Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible after the Statute."
"In order not to create any absurd alternatives, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who ran for the first time and distinguished himself mainly in his opinions towards Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM on today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If football only rides on the Euphoric wave, then there is also a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's holding back.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "conform" the rules for their own purposes."
"That is why a new blockage at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind ultimately wins," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations should allegedly take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality up to the qualification game will be complete at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were supposed to fly to Podgorica, could not even start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, and so one was anxiously looking for a replacement, as one still brings a part of the executive committee to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday, is crucial.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the split parties within the country's largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of the Czech football team and the forthcoming ČSTV Annual General Meeting, which is to guide Czech sport towards the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is in the fight for the chairman's position because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers in front of the extraordinary general meeting, could have made up a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the football association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have agreed to the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclik ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is thus to prevent the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the case of his victories, he intends to exercise the position of chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too much involved in the football business.
"I have spoken personally with some of the people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify themselves with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegates' votes on general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta had the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in Czech football it didn't progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," said Paclík.
He also points out that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with phone interrogations for the investigation in a corruption affair, but Pelta emerged more strongly.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees something more serene.
However, if Paclík won the Thursday election, he could imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the October Annual General Meeting, who ended up with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) was the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to run the association as a manager."
"I don't have my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had caused him to stand at the head of the Dagmar Damková after the arbitration commission was convened with Lu­ěk Macela.
Paclík himself claims that he feels that he has grown the role of the chairman of the association.
He is also the head of Pilsen, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which may be in bad situations," said Paclík, who does not make a heel from his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he saw the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would praise political leaders for increasing the flow of money from the lottery tax into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to".
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not look like a handicap, although he emphasizes himself, the chairman of the FAČR had to be "super-party".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will trigger a pat situation in the future.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make himself strong in the event of his election for the FAČR to have a new statute, which in the future excludes disputes over the electoral system from the outset.
Prior to Thursday's debate in Nymburk, the Jablonec official is confident and believes that the election campaign will certainly be dispelled if the Czech election is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September, he wanted to concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last Annual General Meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec Club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
This is also why he believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football team.
He is convinced that the Euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek is responsible for today's election problems.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the Annual General Meeting in June, which were not as perfect as they had all accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman as of September," said Pelta.
In particular, he used the revision of the main document of the Citizen's Association as a means of attracting delegates.
"If I should become chairman, I would take it personally and be prepared to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a matter of principle without which he cannot be," says Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to demarcate himself against his opponents.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent was his first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík has also not attacked him for a long time, which in turn left no dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"But his attacks were cutting and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That's why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes to the national team.
And this is supposed to be Czech football.
"I would also try to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians to the aftermath of the corruption scandal of the past year."
"Just after that, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football industry," said ČTK, forty-six-year-old candidate, two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personal cleaning.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, because of the long anarchy, there is obviously nervousness.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only point of contention is how to choose in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former Deputy Chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new Chairman of the Czech Republic's football association at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly be a defeat to many members of the association.
Rajchl promises to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek started.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, from national selection, professional football, to youth football."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football can advance in each segment with milestones."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of just criticising the work of others, they would have to start working really hard themselves now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it had been considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't throw a button between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"But many people told me that I should not give up because otherwise it would also do others."
"That's trust you can't play," he said.
Apparently he also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have managed a large piece of work and I don't want to just throw that away."
"Procedures have been started, which are probably only valid in a few years and I would not see anyone stop," he said, expressing his concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't do."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the elected."
I guess you can blame me for a few things, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because everybody is doing well and not just the chosen one," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for ants."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian section, whose winners then went into the first league each."
"Then it couldn't happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravian," says Rajchl.
Since the head of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik joined the struggle for the position of chairman, Rajchl is not sure to assess his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the savings of ten million crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lottery Act as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames the association for not drawing on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football to regain confidence," he believes the second rival - Paclik for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the staffing in the Commissions, he would obviously not change in principle."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favor," Rajchl judges over his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump to the Blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optics, Punkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spasms.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip over the past one and a half years, one could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying back on the water, she looked high in artistically designed domes, she swam marble powders waiting for them at the basin edge, and marveled at carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she recorded it in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored the architectural historian Meder in this way - and now she presents her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
With sports she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Regrettably only that swim fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while jogger can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to happy bird whiskers in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based meds.
"So I began to collect beautiful bathrooms."
Water Surface Doubled Architecture
The spa factor in bathrooms is therefore so great because all senses are served, says Meder.
And when the builders have given themselves trouble, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "A floor is set on a bath with a water surface."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture band "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes a desire to jump into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrated water in a pristine karst cave (a cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the whole city is in sight from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can see the drift on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits guests in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open to the top, it evaporates in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool did the pool collector Meder of the smell of chlorine go into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong for heating oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slick sticks one to the skin as soon as you can slide into the basin - a special kind of wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing areas: when she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing pool in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found an enclosed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, was closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, one has acted against the decay in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bath behind them; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements, which come from times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favourite pool of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to merge different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
At such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only secondary.
Agricultural Speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business of agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the head of the Group then wants to have consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges push prices up - and the banks therefore bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche-Bank-Chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, raw materials bets were intended to secure dealers against price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that the socks have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business was "worthy to put the Deutsche Bank's reputation at risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations of the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the examination will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank - including recommendations on how to deal with this.
At the end of January, the bank's top wants to report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the raw material business, or even a complete turn-off.
Ackermann makes his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatically how reckless banks are now damaging the general well-being."
Ackermann is now especially required as the top bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio where money is spent on bets for food prices," Bode said.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes at first glance surprisingly, but it is clear that a few months before his resignation, the CEO wants to give a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not change to the Supervisory Board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make any losses, he hardly needs to shave - this would eventually have to do with his successor.
Each second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa interviewed 1001 people.
So just eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer facilities that are bet on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: every second would, according to the survey, cancel all investments in which money flows into raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to think about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The Moving Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and stoned.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition hall.
If modern post-war architecture is flooded with clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brüssler World Exhibition is a striking and famous example.
Schwanzer Pavilion got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his lightweight and floating steel glass construction at the time.
The construction is still considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so known that he also built the pavilion at the next world exhibition in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus scotch-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
After the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, his temporary exhibition pavilion had been erected, rebuilt and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20er Haus" was called it.
However, the building was neither spatial nor technical as a museum - no walls for hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krishanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a lucky event in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007, took the lead.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of art historian with considerable careers, among others in youth as an ice-cream runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, worked hard on the reconstruction with politicians and monumentists, obtained public funds and private sponsors, and established the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because he changed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensitively and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer's Technical University in Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "very important place" where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and ease of use when it moved to Vienna.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy slug," says Krishanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two lower floors brought space for the new use, a lower light trench between house and street ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light cock pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house has been painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly what it used to be.
And all of this under strict supervision of the Monuments Authority and with a small budget.
"Often, a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor on the ground floor.
Despite all the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "that came out of Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "wake up a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been an urban happiness: around the Swiss garden, the completely new "main railway station" with offices and houses is being created.
And another lucky case may still occur: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krishanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, it already negotiates with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in million height
The railway has developed a crisis plan designed to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn reports that over 70 million euros will be spent in addition this year.
The "Picture" newspaper reported in advance, referring to a Group-internal crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of around EUR 300 million were planned.
This would improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees for the snow removal on railway installations and rail access to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 per cent of the necessary operating distances.
Two months ago, Railway Manager Rüdiger Grube had warned of train failures and delays after a top meeting with government and industry this winter.
Last winter the railway had considerable problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves, among other things, under difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railway Agency for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years the railway has also made it possible for them to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at the Cologne Central Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar fine in the USA
After the Tumult for Chief Josef Ackermann, a new inconvenience comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank must pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are now bringing in their past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars in a comparison (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the collapse of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes to a large number of major banks to have misled the cooperative banks with false promises for the purchase of financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and cut banks to the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not admit any guilt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to the payment of $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the discovery of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US co-operative banks and jumps in at Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billion-dollar damage.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also predicated other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase sued, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage papers in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble exploded in 2007, this became a disaster for a large number of financial corporations.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Although the events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried countless complaints to obtain compensation or to suspect errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest lawsuit wave.
It advocates 18 international large banks to have overestimated the two state-owned real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file a complaint against the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires Frankfurters to be on the verge of "substantial losses" without, however, mentioning an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as impeccable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion at IBM
Finanzguru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies can only be predicted poorly.
However, he had now read IBM's Annual Report and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He had had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily provided services and computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered to be a knight in the financial world.
As a result, the IBM IT Urgestein can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now revealed in the US economics channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM had not known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had brought good profits.
"You did a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
IBM has been focusing on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centres for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached for example a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns around 80 subsidiaries, including shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost insidious sense of making money has given him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was announced, the IBM stock increased by one percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the world's most valuable technology companies together with Apple and Microsoft.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, he doesn't want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates was a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the Zwickauer Zelle, Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a small Greek entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded to in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkish people, a long-faithful ghost returns: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the revealed right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from visible.
"Is the bloody ideology back on?" the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" titled the Internet issue.
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasises that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities too could be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with the intention of remembering the victims of racist violence with a memorial watch in front of the Brandenburg Gate on the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish acquisition agreement.
It had been staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
Like an eardrum, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot be taken to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been murdered, that taxes had been paid and that their work had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German Turkish Internet forums, the conduct of the police and its subsequent success is being discussed in a very critical way.
The authors wonder why the German authorities did not have much more time to look for suspects in extreme right-wing circles.
Some of them show themselves at least rhetoricalally prepared to use drastic means: "If we continue to snuff out here, nothing but self-defense and arms will remain for the migrants."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger made clear by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of Solingen's fire ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, exacerbated our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly contested after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After Solingen's fire, he sent an accompaniment chart to the Turkish Presidents, but was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at Cologne's funeral ceremony - Kinkel mentioned how many taxes the Turks paid.
Just like that, the value of a person is calculated by the amount of its tax.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been since then in the local rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive investigation and re-evaluation of the far-right terrorism in Germany, we need open words this time.
The Skandalbank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, UBS has been almost bankrupt and has been slipping from crisis to crisis.
Now it's for a German to judge.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it was announced that in 2013 he would take on an almost as spectacular new job: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grossbank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidarity and made friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But as early as September, it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A dealer of UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank's security systems and swallowed around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as being elected - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been announced that Weber may consult the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics, he's a banker, and he's a banker.
He then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long earned the title "greatest scandal bank in Europe".
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand, it has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also buffed Swiss asset managers had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to be a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, the UBS managed, on the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars, more money for customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she was in the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students at the time I always set UBS as a pattern for a good bank."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I be so wrong?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something quite wrong was happening in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Officer Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later, they figured out why he had left.
The bank's investment line had been covered with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To do this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, though, over whom some of them had only recently shrugged their noses: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was so silent that they did not even know its name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, the Board of Directors of Marcel Ospel, who was still the second best-paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse of the financial crisis in view of its misinvestment and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced migration bond, over which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses such big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS in 2007 was more than five times that of Switzerland's economic performance (see Graph).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster was followed by the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who might have been taxed with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions along with penalty payments.
The UBS thus knew more or less openly to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of the CEO and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking through the falsifications and asset management through the aid for tax evasion.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as you thought, now the UBS will get back to it, so this unsavory dealer story follows: A single dealer swallowed up 1.7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes obvious: with the risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn't work.
"The case of Adoboli has made it clear that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, for security for money - even beyond the Alpine republic might the world break down.
The Swiss banks' safe havens had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich are still suitable for the clever Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classical.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main railway station directly to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitist private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by a heavy turning door.
Inside are the walls marble-clad, before which there are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign for the "Safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has displaced both large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point they have betrayed or betrayed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the paper, but, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS had become far too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fishing Saxons had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing left to say.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, gave it first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became visible on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million nation decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros have been approved by the politicians to save the big bank that is facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big at the merger for the small Switzerland - and grew more and more.
In doing so, the two different forerunner banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came to a great deal of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors at that time.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach person who has worked from banking to top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffle.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Of course: Overconfidence came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, on which CEO Wuffli keeps issuing the same parole: Goldman Sachs comes out of the throne.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the foreign exchange business and in the stock trade, she played at the top.
However, business consultants, who were commissioned, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the "Fixed Income" banking language, there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
She developed into a huge machine that packaged and extended securities on American mortgage credit - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long sought the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought it there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after another had to go when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become sluice seats and are still fragile.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has managed all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: end of investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink sharply, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only meant as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from previous pitfalls.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he is to run the UBS's business on a permanent basis, the Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to move the investment bank back to the middle of the nineties.
3500 jobs he strokes.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself now.
He says publicly that he will first look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdened US stock exchange
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage of the US investors at the start of the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The turbulent industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes of stabilising the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still half-full last week, not half-empty - but now the problems got back to the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales cards.
The Dow-Jones index of the default values recorded a trade close by 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of the trade, the market survey ranged between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax passed with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced their production and is at the end of the upturn.
Enterprises produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
This was skeptical to the US investors: "We are not an island, we are dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from recession as quickly as possible, and there will be further signs of weakness in banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett simply confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for an end to the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw over the pile a decade-old principle and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional company and initially had him record against the trend in the trade process just under one percent higher.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece according to its own data and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of its investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America's shareholdings were significantly stronger than the market, with 2.6 percent.
The house silvers almost the rest of its shares in the China Construction Bank and spends $6.6 billion on it.
With the net profit from the business, the institution wants to increase its capital ratio in particular, thereby complying with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft builder Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the Group had collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-distance machines of type 777 on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at 18 billion dollars.
Including options on 20 other machines, the volume is even 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed ownership.
719 values increased, 2281 gave up and 79 remained unchanged.
At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares made 630 in the plus, 1913 in the minus, and 82 unchanged.
Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are considered "problem birds": However, experts claim that the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents’ complaints about the dirt and noise of the animals accumulate.
A means against the "problem birds" is not in sight.
Seed crows were no longer to be extracted from the cities, said experts at the first Krähensymposium in the East Frisian void.
There, experts from all over the federal territory are advising on possible routes.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Naturalists also brought the problems in cities back to the land flight of the specially protected seed crows: chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroys traditional habitats.
Hunting, growing cultivation and the fall of typical brooding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crayons are protected by nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district was responsible for negative strokes.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the ramifications, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver found out from Empty.
Spraying nests with water or falling trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals depart, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Foaming is only possible as an exception to hospitals, old-age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get rid of them."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Empty.
It is conceivable that there will be a combination of animals from sensitive living areas and lockers to relocate them to other places.
On the other hand, "information boards instead of chainsaws" the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens asked for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: "We can finally bear a pickle in the face with the best self-confident."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen teaching path in Schleswig-Holstein, where he informed about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication that they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get to a tasty bite, but even produce their tools themselves as an aid.
Behavioral researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed crows, how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they had to bring down a scaffold with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined what size and shape a stone had to have in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the fluffy crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid wire pieces for them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then hunted the bucket at the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seedlings even succeeded.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Guided by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM-participation in a row after the 0:0 game.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off-back game with outsiders of Montenegro, after the gamble (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
No more burning Croatia against Turkey at 0:0, Ireland brought a looser 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other hits for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga pro Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal achieved a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from about 30 meters to the early lead into the worms.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long shots and met at 2:0 from 25 metres.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of an hour, had their first clear chance by Torhunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a baseball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not exceed the goalline (33.).
Jiracek meets Czech Republic
After that, Arbitrator Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the centre of his mind.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penitentiary, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic was sure to transform.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made everything clear with four hits.
In the 81st minute, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic.
In 1976, the European Champion will go to EM for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nürnberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a horror second already in the early phase.
With a reflex at the last moment, Endemann Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the border of punishment just barely past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross-blade had to save the Czech world-class gatekeeper, and again the stormer of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
After all, the gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey thus missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hidedink must thus almost certainly clear his seat on the 2002 World Cup Third Bank, the Croats can rejoice at their fourth participation in an EM round.
Before 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost reached a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the post, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the impacter in the gate.
After the horror second, however, Croatia took control more and more.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who made his seat for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga Legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bavaria Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni drives to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the game, in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian outback prevent the possible leader.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unfortunate defense by Endeman Pavel Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball over the line at 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and recruit corresponding employees," co-chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader in business software will double from five to ten or eleven.
Up to now SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4000 of the worldwide more than 176 000 SAP customers are in the boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 strategy of the Dax Group.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year the Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software provider's business, which employs 55 000 people worldwide, is running almost rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China supported by comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Emotionally and generously, Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Fear. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that go to your heart.
Here is a tip on how to do this: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic story. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raving reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and terror" almost means the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, get mad or die.
Each of these lives flashes on like the votive candles in a church, some are added, while others extinguish.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war on the West Front.
"Beauty and terror" wanders with expert views over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bee baskets, a celebration of Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells like Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Stay or take the run?
Who's even coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "are furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and terror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englund’s little moments of gathering lost in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made of pressed rice and baked in bulk fat (and last but not least served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes soaked with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes, which were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "One feels that, despite all that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, and so to do as meaning such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind his own strengthened and lamented shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and no one will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe, which is falling apart, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in a scale suit that slaughters while he sits behind a desk."
Human beings behave in an unforeseen way and there is as peaceful behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexual disease in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque expression of it can be discovered in trade with Gonokkken Eiter, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital in this way," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate to see him in the eye, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "disseminated uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on the First World War were usually more forged like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book of facts.
I'm not giving it back.
But it's as if he took this page away with his book with the main characters in front of his nose and lit us with a match.
After an early misstep, a minute planned assault
Hundreds of policemen were involved, some of them wearing helmets.
They had decided for the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-ranking officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protestors, which violates the rules of the department and provided the houseowners with an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing occupations in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - anti-terrorism measures, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which meant a declaration as "exercise".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including emergency services from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually deployed in high - criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day many people go into and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1:00 a.m. is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people are in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before the descent at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the prerecorded news that rang out of the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protestors.
When the public officials caught up in their light blue wind jackets in the park, many protestors simply gathered their things and left the place.
The police said that by 1:45 no tents would be put on to give the Protestants time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen collecting in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesperson of the police president, said that this had been done to their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officials' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved westwards through the great mess of personal belongings of the Protestants, including suitcases, artificial turfs and bags with clothes, their employee followed the cleaning of the city that had been lifted, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters attracted position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were connected to their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, as reported by the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were, as he said, due to "irrespective behaviour and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent local official was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was there too.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "led the operation not," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a roadblock north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It could be observed how from these police sites the perimeter extended further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place was observed, as several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern perimeter.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Trade union of supervisors will file an action against the city for dismissals
The union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, because the dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory due to their inadequate influence on the schools teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last opportunity left open by the union, district council 37, in its efforts to reverse redundancies.
Six hundred seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city and who had lost their jobs in a chess train on 7 October, described the trade union leader as political revenge for refusing access to a health fund that the working groups had held, with which the budget gaps should be closed.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specified that employees of the school assistance would be released.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education about a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to formally announce the filing of the appeal before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The action will be brought by Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as defendant and eight redundant workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latin-American women, as are most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not in the process of suing, and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft appeal submitted by the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of school redundancies in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools had lost more help because they were chronically underfunded.
It explains that while there were no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost in the 23rd district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the 8th and 9th districts in the South Bronx.
With the observation of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of well-trained parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. Furthermore, money was lost when the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for each poor school enrolment.
The union also complains that the leaders of the High Schools were led by the language in a memo into the wrong which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the salary list of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," the draft appeal states.
Mission ended, Congress prepared to reach agreement on Libya
In the end, it looks as if Republicans and democrats in Washington are already having an understanding of the uprisings in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations adopted a resolution which was submitted to Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "mut".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House disputed the choice of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain issued a resolution approving the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law was passed in the Senate. In addition, the board passed a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. Mission entered a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was busy enough to criticise Obama's approach in the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him off the ground under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "grates Libya's people to their enormous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-exemptiveness" and " commends the men and women of the US military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislators as it did the June Act?
The last version meets the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugars spokesperson said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional Legislature period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change to the budget or another area that is currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been presented to this Congress and cover a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to Congress and to the Senate - others differ only slightly from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners from the Republicans who want to polish their careers - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the ban on two Presidential terms.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among equals is, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As zealously as the members propose changes, they move at an uneven pace as in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Meeted, but not defeated," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after an armed man had shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the desire to return to Congress.
When she appeared in the ABC news "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer, she ranked by words and needed help while walking.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, surprisingly, she returned to Congress to give her voice to the debt brake triumphantly.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled and sang - and described her recovery as "heavy".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered (41): "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special, recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos that Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she was seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with his head.
It's a touch of the lip.
And then, her first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see how the congressmen sing "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" along with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said that on March 12 Giffords had read an article on a daily newspaper about the murder when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The suspected shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is compulsorily treated medically while waiting for his trial.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Hart, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated"?
You've only been hit.
And you will survive and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever.
Forces feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and Marines gathered around him.
The amount in black tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the Gala, who was observed, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The sharp contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are being praised for their victims.
But praise has its price, servants say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were suffering the people in uniform.
"We were by no means a victim," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way to support the one is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to be ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops were fighting in recent years of the Vietnam war was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in the quiet and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, the Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe because they had defeated rebels and had traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "enraged, violent veteran under the surface" was hiding, said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and, after his return, took over an elevated state post in Washington.
During his search for work, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military heroism as was absolutely normal in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military puts itself under increasing pressure to get through rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are charged with non-interventional rape before the military court.
Should this not be the case, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week she was pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who carried a 12th pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texan woman wiped out her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, claimed she.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint it has filed against former Minister of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a Washington D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months it rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to find out, condemn or provide appropriate case law after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem started there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the cultural retribution of the? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many further complaints to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Ministry of Defense, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss a complaint.
The documents of the court that are available for Newsweek detail the defense strategy, in particular that the military cannot be charged with violations by current or former soldiers to which it has come in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for any injuries to soldiers in active service.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the plaintiffs," says the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction lies in the name only: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, soldiers' teams play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combat.
It is time for the military to be modernised, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a lawsuit against the four most important military academies for the alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
Independently, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America files a lawsuit against the military focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that was given rape victims to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December her group filed an action against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the administration of the war veterans) in which she claimed to have been sexually abused in the service in her treatment of performance claims.
Nine laws have been submitted to Congress independently of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported by the Ministry of Defense.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military were brought to trial, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a set of rapes and the blood of her attacker, who came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her friend before the assault.
Six persons spoke out as witnesses in the name of the suspected perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would be used. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, "That wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was irreverently released so that she did not receive any support.
Whether the action that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military lags behind for a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence that a liability brings with them.
He adds, "The chances are against them, but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms occur," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed an amok race in Norway in July, at which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time in front of his computer and chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British Idea Factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to precisely define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extreme groups across Europe and then inspected them with add-ons, but instead of linking themselves to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking for their educational status, their attitude towards violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a rather new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online promoters of right-wing extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a sort of surprising twist are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more rational, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom that has increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page, which you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried earlier to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook it all goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found out that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more inclined to drink problems than students who are silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that equivalent students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in the 2010 interim elections and a National Luck Index (mainly using information that only Facebook has access to - master of digital freedom has long known that the site should make its large data fund for other research purposes accessible.)
But the users of Facebook know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to display its own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think many users ever thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she was concerned, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social issues - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Calt and Inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood two amok races in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said in front of a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hatedologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I'm not guilty."
Judge Torkeil Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who made a preliminary speech, the permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police keep Breivik under investigation for 12 weeks, that he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence over eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims' relatives took part in the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in their eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was staying behind the lock and bars.
Everyone took part with the goal that everything goes on a roadblock.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian radio station NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and worked calmly and professionally throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had been accomplice.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the victim's relative.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans might find most revealing in the recently discovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed hippie, but he was also an ardent organizer who worked zealously on charts - a man who believed that many managing directors are suffering from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the break-up of the Personal Computer. And he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since Apple had been forced out of jobs, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
It was only after job death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reworked film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for abhorring detailed interviews, jobs here seem surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
Over the course of the interview, there will be four longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfectionism comes to light when it seems impatiently responds to cringely's questions and encourages him to respond more quickly to topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow unmistakably farsighted when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous valuations of career jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the leap to grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he pulled off and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in the business I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues its efforts to streamline accounting with Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs", which were calculated on mere assumption and which were then adjusted with "difference" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest extent.
How the Pope was made aware of:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could sneak into the telephone company and conduct long distance calls for free.
Much has already been written about the device, but job enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-determination, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-based phone, make a call and then connect from one AT&T network to another while they drag as many satellites as possible through.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times, and when you cried on the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," says Joberend.
"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that can control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be any without it Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called through the Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh loose before the Pope came to the phone himself.
How he fell in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think both through the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember powerful arguments... you yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15.
About large companies that leave behind:
Long before he revived Apple, jobs saw ahead of them the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions had stumbled and lost control of their shares.
"Did we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the monopoly of shares, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are such people] who ultimately run the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly position, is being eradicated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger, could have been Microsoft in the 1990s...
You won the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
In the end, it goes to taste, it goes on to try to get involved with the best stuff that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who by chance are the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are dining with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political-sharing question of whether to listen to a challenge to the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the law firm that the case was represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be dealt with was an action brought by 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which was decided by Congress last year, a law that became the slogan of conservative activists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to stimulate the 2012 presidential campaign, which will be in full swing at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law is to tilt will probably be Paul Clement, once the Attorney General under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an ancient group dedicated to defending conservative principles of law.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that contests the law.
Another sponsor was Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical giant, who is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republicans' political group in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the federalist society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events of law nearer and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or according to the program no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms involved in the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert moral and government activists.
"This amazing violation of morality and the opposition to the Code punishes the actions of some judges lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a Benefizi event with lawyers with floating trial in the court."
Their appearance and their support for a donation campaign for this event undermine any claim for impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix courtship too easily with groups who are led by the agenda, such as the federalist society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state attorney general under the Obama government when the first legal appeals came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because she was too engaged in defending the law in order to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record orders of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Airline Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft totals at a record amount of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest contract for commercial aircraft at all times on weekends, measured by the value of the order: 50 dual Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars in 2011 at the Dubai Aviation Show.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, exchange specialist from Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend to cancel or shift aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have natural security," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in check, which attacks the premise with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350 that competed directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more confidence after customers had demanded a higher payload and reach.
The Boeing shares increased 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparently election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have supported opponents Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race for the governors' posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won from the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, the race for the governors' positions in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the Sunday election.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied election booths, built roadblocks ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just struck Claderon, who had still led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the current governor, came to third place, a severe defeat for the split and hapless left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links with drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates rose out of fear of the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how outrageous the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented by the PRI in the race for the president's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory leaves us bravely looking into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations of the world must do "everything in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), which are "passionless" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"Everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is thus helpful," he said at the Financial Times in an interview on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asien may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been experiencing a serious debt crisis over the past few months.
In the past few days Italy's interest cost has increased dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging severe debt crisis in Europe is exacerbating fears that the global economy could fall into recession and led to calls that leading emerging economies should join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of EU bailouts, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's an assignment, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at American Brown University, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe, of whom more than 800 million out of 2 dollars or even less live a day.
"At some point they will find out that the Greeks retire with 50 and spend vacations on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on all of Asia.
The forecast of the ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/is now threatening "the risk of classification" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant migration of capital of their sayings.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cuts in defense
Minister of Defense Leon Panetta warmed up the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticably, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civilian riverside bands.
The Pentagon is already contemplating cuts of 450 trillion dollars in the coming decade, but is now afraid that further cuts of 600 trillion dollars or more will be necessary if Congress cannot reach a conclusion on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called confiscation, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"This would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness."
The cuts were finally hit by the combat forces," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the anti-terrorist campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of the war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and the recruitment supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of staff would be reduced, which would lead to late payments to wartime traders and would have disrupted both legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and there is certainly no one to force us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be permitted."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be expected.
Panetta has increasingly unbreathed the possible cuts, although he could gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what could happen - a military with shells, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force of contention that lacks morals and alertness and is unable to accept it with potential opponents."
"She's actually making you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta gave new details on how reductions "created significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and resilience, leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects of the strike could fall victim to the victims, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes fighter pilot F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighter vehicle that needs the Army and Navy to replace the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step towards upgrading so that possible dangers can be banished by China and other opponents.
How to Uncover a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how thoughtful and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the master of the accusations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as reportedly held back reports after which a retired football coach had sexually abused a boy.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman Anthony Weidner made himself a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is charged with the violation of campaign financing, which is linked to the custody of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about school rumblings and college exams are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the examination answers so that they could do well even in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and rumblings are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Identifying lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every human being, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as Sharaden, in which it is the goal to call "Hab you!", deterring a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at respected universities that carried out far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of research is that most old myths have been deflected from the lie.
Lies look into your eyes.
They stutter, stammer, redden and don't always gag.
But we must not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and defile.
A trained lie deterrent can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing field of detachment. And it is clear that detachment of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding out in our complex world, especially if hiring or questioning persons or negotiations or administration are one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appraising other people's interests and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that the extroverted people lie more often than introverted people that men are more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "orientated to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less often than unwed people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been defunct as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of having lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually constantly triples with his foot, so that they do not wrongly accuse him when he triples his foot during a meeting.
Then watch out for accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of detonation.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet are pointing towards the door or they are leaning toward the exit, changing their position significantly or showing a "relaxment after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhale and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often falsely signal that a job interview is over, only to look out for this relaxation after the interview.
Also be aware of the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's snitch is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can also use a distancing language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I am known ... to best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, often causing the alarm bells to shrill.
There is no means of magic to detear lies, but you can learn skills through which detearment is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become less likely to be the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised following a threat by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which made trade unions angry and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to replan the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company is still confident that the pipeline will be finally approved, albeit with a different course.
This was followed by an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision was taken on a federal approval for the project until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, opposite Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered, may take a decision by 2013, following the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama announced last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, defy the laws to force a departure from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy said that the main inspector of the Ministry requested a separate probe of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she allegedly forced a toddler out of fear of vomiting
A New York family claims that the Disco Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a violent attack that would have put her little daughter in such fear that she surrendered to fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made Genevieve Monk so afraid that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
On November 10, last year, stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, was a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on his arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You should not put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to shudder - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tip water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle fell upon the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companionship and pulled into a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no answer.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The claim is for a damages not specified in detail, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he would not charge the fees and the family would plan to donate the money they get to help children with cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is placed opposite a kindergarten girl who wears an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate change slowed the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and gave great hope to economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic hardships, growth cannot be the talk of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in agriculture at millions but also limited the growth of the national economy and in the first quarter caused a general fall in economic activity of 3.6 per cent. This is mainly due to the historical decline of agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which slowed down on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of land used for agriculture were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The fall in economic activity by November has steadily increased unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, as from January to March, 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment, corresponding to 4.53 percent of the labour force. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which is 18,969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented that public institutions' policies indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently observing is an increase in unemployment, which has several factors to do with. Among other things, with market liquidity losses as a result of the austerity cuts by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are not allowed to accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or otherwise use them."
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there as well. These people stay here and are looking for work to increase unemployment," he says.
Blackworking
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if the high proportion of undeclared work is taken into account.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretary of Trabajo y Previsión Social (government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was up to September 5352 pesos; that is much less than the general government average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decrease in the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and increasing unemployment, the biggest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI from January to June amounted to 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to a float of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143 312 dollars in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the light of the economic crisis, in July the State Government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
The first year of government, Mario López Valdé's inability to government was made clear to the representatives of entrepreneurship.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It has to be worked hard to regain the lost terrain this year and in 2012 we have to make double efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the well-coordinated government team have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slow-down economy that is not moving enough to produce an economic dynamics that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will complete the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Profession
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico Business Association) in Sinaloa, said that the state had to be brought about more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that would lead to better government efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas in which it can be said that the government has acted more extensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg marijuana
Five years in prison and 100 days in prison, a national of Navolato was sentenced to eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic Procuratorate announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on June 7, 2010 by Mexican military forces in the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez versus 80 guard post in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated product was handed over to the district judge and the sentenced person is still in the penitentiary.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants foreseen in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes run the risk of not being completed due to lack of resources or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the Social Development Authority stated that, although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, as the government has not paid the funds it has to pay for the three programmes, which exceed 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction was expected.
"12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny, and this, although they have had to pay us a bit in July," he said. "To not be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the congregation had to borrow 7 million at the beginning of its reign. This corresponds to the amount that the central government should have paid.
"We had already done so in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient financial resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not spent to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the public authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance, , was asked to speed up administrative work and to pay the outstanding amount as soon as possible.
"They must contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have not given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The switch from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidential Decree, which require the transfer of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the absence of eight votes necessary for the legal challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree-Law with the details of the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate, since it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the appeals project, which was drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Legislative Decree unconstitutional as the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicación (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, which is why the Decree-Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and legal reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Decree-Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree-Law and ceased all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the appeal lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration under general rules.
"I also do not believe that if this were done, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected." She also recalled that the central government is responsible for the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, as it directs state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a delay in the exploitation of digitalisation, which was a decision in the public interest, which had not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of characteristics which put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
It called to mind that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transition, although they had highly specialised institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government intervened in the powers of Congress with the publication of the disputed decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán separately is considered.
According to the information provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the Governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes in total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballot is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultsados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the governorial elections is just 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, pointed out that just last 9 November, the electorate had adopted a number of rules to harmonise local rules with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms adopted by Congress, so that they had not entered into force during this electoral round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the public prosecutor within the time limits provided for it with the argument or objection.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature and judged the Ombudsman's vote on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and unlawful", since it did not have the right to "find" it or " veto it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of individual counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there is now the possibility that the local electoral authority could count the ballot in part or in full.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part.The results of the minutes do not match; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes do not appear on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total number of full ballot cards may be counted if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the one standing in the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of those candidates.
The total number of votes may also be counted if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate is equal to or less than one percent in the second place, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose second candidate has become. In this case, the voting packages which have been partially counted would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rustled this Sunday evening at Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the show of the dead and a mass of the dead took place.
According to family members, the last intention of the Lieutenant Colonel was to scatter his ashes over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on an airplane of the Mexican Air Force together with the others who were killed in the accident. The colonel was the nearest person to take part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes landed on the hall of mourning, which is located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, and where the family and friends came from.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Institute of Technology. This show was given by his former fellow students by the technical abitur and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said that to his family and his friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the air force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good person. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had driven to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
Last farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honored by the Governor Jorge Torres López. He was honored by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, headmaster and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and became outstanding in both his studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons from the same authority were also killed.
At 18.05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, a citizen of Saltillo, met to be handed over from the funeral company to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. There he was already expecting his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned body was found on a property at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the meeting, military members introduced the media to eleven persons who had been arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transitors saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall was piled up.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons, which they immediately told the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another one dressed with a white top.
Nearly a meter away was the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three of them were on their stomachs.
According to the information received on the spot, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridge sleeves have been found.
On the wall of the country house you can read the inscriptions that one organized gang of criminals writes to another, as well as several shots were found in the wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretary for State Defense) presented 11 persons, including a minor who was part of a criminal activity mainly in the town of Cadereyta and who are associated with kidnappings, murders, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estate and a mobile phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 6:00 a.m., the military found a car without license plates with two occupants in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret confiscations in the places General Terán, China and Caderyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that is expected to present the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government that is expected to present the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidency Palace announced that the Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocratic cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of talks with the political parties on government formation.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well positioned," he added.
Monti has managed to create a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package called for by the euro-politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush on Monti was still exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, resulting from which Italian government bonds were charged at 7 percent interest for 10 years, which corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue shield.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confederation of Industries Confindustria, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the fullest extent possible."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
The chances of success of Monti were greatly increased by the support of the party PDL by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, as so far many of its members have opposed a majority of technocratic governments, which are currently forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying the reforms could once again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Federation of Foreign Banks, with its observation that a failure of Montis was a disaster, also exerts pressure.
Monti started on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening is to conclude the session.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who in response to the crisis initiated an extremely rapid change of government.
After a short breath towards the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
Saving Italy with a national debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue shield.
Monti said that his government would have to take up to the next elections expected to take place in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, pointing out their concerns in view of the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of persons from political life.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players retrieved from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the hump.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 called 50 games is behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared to each other for the friendship game that takes place today at 15.05 am at the San José National Stadium.
While World and European champions, the number one on FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-colored team has only Michael Umana as the only defender with over 50 international games.
He scored this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated secession games at the Eurocup and the world football championships is added.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA ranking list at the very bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: the Iker Casillas Gatekeeper, who reached an equal status with 126 foreign players on last Saturday against England (down 0-1 in London) with the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition last week from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number of 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle tower of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side tower of Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there came only five to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the least games.
Less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet attracted Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour for the celebration of its 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform in the National Stadium with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica from 7.30 p.m.
You will read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also comes true for us.
This is just the second time we've been playing in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I have only once been on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will probably stay there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely yielding. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we’re sorry to have needed so long until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn't that a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've been doing in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a look at the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there, we don't set limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision that we will play each doesn't go easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played anymore, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could become forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year history.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don't think anyone ever imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together now.
We like and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the hour of the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of big bands.
We are well-friended with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are happy to be still friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) met with us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being alive, and then we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have been opened up that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music. We could not be better off.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to lose this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of the music, this reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has created, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. That has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years who had never released a record until the death of Andrew Woods.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and so the band chose for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That’s why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That’s definitely going to be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I think of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could seem a little lenient. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in them.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examination
The former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his family doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated four times and controlled.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congressman and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish to do so because he considered him innocent.
He was operated four times on cancer of the tongue and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition to other diseases such as severe erosion of gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted up.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía Detention Centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several Ministers and Entrepreneurs, will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss regional policy issues.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón. According to the Uruguayan President, this will be the highlight of his booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks the support of Calderón regarding the incident with France, when French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 Summit in Cannes.
In his discourse, Mr Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which are still acting as tax havens, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a question from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, one of the world’s most powerful emerging and industrial countries since November. Since January this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan Government has tried to speed up the concreteisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Since 2004, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
With "Super Mario 3D Land", the slurry installer enters the third dimension
Super Mario has struggled tirelessly for 25 years to save the Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the storetops of the world this month has been tailored from the beginning to the properties of the portable console Nintendo 3DS, with which three-dimensional glasses can be played without a special spectacle.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, who is responsible for the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game by Nintendo, which has been developed for this console from the beginning" , because until now, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it was three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" was an "at cost" video game that allowed a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the various levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time. However, to overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects", always has to be played three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The cordless installer has to overcome speckled platforms with dangers in order to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in movements, the environment, disguises and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom pays for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of the former Governor Alfonso Portillo so that he would be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of $70 million.
Thus, the trial of the US's request for delivery of Portillo ends so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom, confirmed his decision based on the independence of judiciary and government, bearing in mind that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that he had not intervened in court decisions during his government and had accepted all extradition requests from which he was informed.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to condemn the former President of State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation has been clarified in Guatemala and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This negotiation preceded extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case again.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was set up to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: in this quarter of the century, 6,000 young people who have been threatened by social exclusion have been supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, more than a hundred jobs are created for this social group.
Yesterday, at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated, a balance was drawn.
Trinijove was created in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by many responsible bodies and institutions who worked together with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green town councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is “a good foundation”.
Trinijove is an example for the President of the General Quote, who knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupyed house where giant parties were held was cleared
The owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without having done any resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on Balmes Street have ended.
Twelve people voluntarily left yesterday afternoon the building that they had been illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The evacuation took place on judicial order without police intervention.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house manager.
The housekeepers, who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the others were inhabited - took along the entire electrical system and part of the water supply. Moreover, they had painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, lasting up to two days and driving the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that her business had decreased by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the homeowners made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure facility had been shown by the neighbors for rest, while according to their claim the noise was not stirred by the visitors of the disco, but by the house owners and in particular by the guests of the feasts that were organized there, and that, according to the statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks, became more and more and more.
The head of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The president of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week asked to clear the building immediately and get the problems of bourgeois cohabitation and the downfall of the district.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that in the last few months the occupants had pre-empted on all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some even thefts had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to take action against the asocial actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35 street after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people wanting to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees, agree to the invitation to tender.
The urban call for 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its pamphlet on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became again in the eyes of many people at the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few, which does not spread in the north-south direction, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, Yellowstone and wild boar in the role of Yogibar were no longer the Central Park.
As far as the city was concerned, in September a huge invitation to tender, consisting of 16 competitions, was issued for further access to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
It's either that or someone's going to put gates on the land.
The question is self-evident: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to reflection on the city, the topic of conversation in the mouth of all the architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive issue on which two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can draw.
And this very fact offers the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, after the attack on the coast, it is necessary to talk about the "front of the mountains" insofar as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore von Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not "think of it as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, sees the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which poses "some dangers".
Risks arising from the "insecurity that brings about the design of a public space these days" based on the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swan song" in the area of the forum.
The first fear is its own limitation on what can be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, believes that the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park which does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study by Patronat de Collserola that should not "come to deaf ears" although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his board the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of the guidebook allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "difference" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly what is right," he says) "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because there is no global view of Collserola in the tendering conditions: "There have been 16 cross-sectional competitions", he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that views the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strips are equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt at all lengths, resulting in a soft transition between city and green areas.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the administrator of Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial that is being conducted against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the administrator of Casino Red has given him the trial before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which runs the trial against the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is on display, who is supposed to force him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the prosecution, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the Panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest order after the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the detention centre of Cadereyta, because he had probably bribed the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security section, as threats of murder were presented against him.
The authorities allowed him to take part in the trial as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a prison decree, which stated that after nearly two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence to justify the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the courthouse in order to open it in return.
On this Monday, the administrator of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to release the mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had done the damage and which the owner of the competition had pronounced his forgiveness. The lawyer, however, withheld the name.
According to case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak. Nor can there be any opposition to the proceedings, nor will any damages be claimed.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free after the hearing of the authorised representative of the betting house at 3:50 p.m.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza City Prison to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the aircraft accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretary of Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat für Kommunikation und Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation of the accident in which the Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and another seven persons were killed indicate that the helicopter was rallied directly against the ground with its entire undamaged structure, without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees at 25 metres high, with the helicopter losing its hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other locations, which covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to obtain the results of the studies as soon as possible, but they could take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary of Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at a flight speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, this was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions during the take-off. During the transit to the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds rose.
Selected routes:
It is possible that due to the clouds the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact site:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are in line. Before the impact, there may not have been any loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route.
Dissemination of the remains of the aeroplane in a limited area:
The information available up to this time indicates that the helicopter had been impacted in a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was impacted on the ground with its unharmed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the site of the accident neither on fire nor on explosion.
The final results of the investigation indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is parched and has a slope of between seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the enclosed area of the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforced the assumption that the undamaged aircraft structure was rallied against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The National Social Insurance Institute of Mexico is directing a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project on the discovery of obesity genes in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers are to be found in association with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unitad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especiliades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers, was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested people can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday starting at 8 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began at the Cuahtémoc sports field (western Mexico State) and was continued since 8 October at the Nezahualcóyolt sports field (eastern México State).
If the goal is met by 500 to 600 investigators, the study will be continued on the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the aim of the study was to identify factors and the role of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors for Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he stated that three thousand children and young people aged six to 14 years should be filled in with the consent and supervision of their parents in questionnaires related to nutrition.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on Saturdays the investigators (weight, size, waist size), their blood pressure were controlled and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors were determined (trying to identify genes related to obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out on the basis of health care professionals' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of obese girls by 47 percent. Excessive weight also increased dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that one (e) Mexican (in) is an average of 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity were inability to burn out the excess of energy (calories) taken from us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that direct benefits for the investigators were found in a comprehensive study of children who would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-existing diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all the measurement results to the parents and suggest changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short paths.
The high calorie intake, i.e., increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt prevented by UNAM
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would it not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 keyholes if the rainy season broke out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt coating were appropriately damaged, the number of strokes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Slapholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible developed modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Mr.era Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of pitfalls.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, a part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part a low - the so-called maltene. Together they give the road surface its characteristic elastic behaviour.
The calcareous behaviour of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very solid and almost solid at 50°C, while at very low temperatures it breaks down.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," explained the chemical engineer.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of flexible road surface consisting of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalted and then fortified stones.
Every single stone of this layer of wear has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called bearing layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e., sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they need to produce friction.
This road surface receives and distributes the most forces, and the bearing layer also needs an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes wet, water enters the layer and escapes only difficult again. This causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and consequently the appearance of percussion holes.
When a punch hole occurs," he said, "the layer is first worn off, while the layer of wear is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico's National Research System) stated that the vehicle load was another important cause for the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface always had to be proportionate to the vehicle load and it had to be ensured that this regulation was complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still a lot of research work to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, with which the keyholes could easily be repaired without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that led to Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Again, Valle del Cauca left empty at the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning stage, showing a silver crown and the band she was presenting as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the departamento comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown almost in their hands. Amongst the proclaimed misses are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monaica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing had she been elected to the Queen of Police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beautiful queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury's decision to appoint her first miss is that she had not convinced her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos the answer to the question, "Which book has influenced you the most and why?", which Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a kind of civilizing, ultimately I think that the book that shaped the strongest for my childhood is 'The Little Prince', a rather profound book.
Currently, I read 'debt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'suffering'.
An answer that encountered little love, firstly because of the concept of 'civilizing' and secondly because she had not specifically explained the way in which each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one who had received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomy contest Easter, audience vote on the best hand-cut costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous what the queen was stressing, which therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was noticed in her first performance in the swim suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and in her two lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she was safe with both of them, she lacked the strength and the momentum shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will eventually not become Queen".
Additionally, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doggy said they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already cooperated in projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derriere and the fibrosis that was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the belly, which was frankly hardly noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedure she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make her do it right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to be realized at night. It was dubbed that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to let them come to the pleasure of the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that from today on, Melina will begin her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, had escaped the crown.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoscopist from Cali entered history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lophoscopy of the unit of investigation of the Cali Procuratorate (CTI) confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had been on standby, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he settled after Valle over and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
He flew from Palmira to Cauca in the helicopter on Friday night.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore, he should take along the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least like the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a plant cellar and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the printing sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the head of the FARC.
On Track Search
The appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliasar González at a press conference on the use of "cano" was very important for a daktyloskope from Sijín in Cali.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopeists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they have none.
We'll take them off the fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house with a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this very place, when he pulled out a box full of jewelry and money.
"walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of schnapp.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopy stated that "the fingerprints were taken from the object with chemical or physical reagents."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take them.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, that's the crime database, or to the stand office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without ID cards," said the CTI expert.
He said not everything was the same as it was shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold shines, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "Emports" are calling out the authorities in New York.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
Most of them followed the evacuation order and changed their location to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhattan Square after they had been removed from the square in the dawn and had tried to occupy a different place at Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered before the Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to gain access with a judicial order that allowed the "employees" to re-camp at this place. Meanwhile, another part of the movement held to the evacuation order and occupied a park further north of the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the square, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray argued that the "Emports"' response to the evacuation of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City, came before the court where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the violent evacuation of the place and the demonstrators approved the tent.
In addition, the "Emposites" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixt Avenue, just near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can’t give any exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization assures that there have been hundreds of people in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square (an area in private property) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing, which is still open for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the enclosures in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven by the place carried photocopies of this court order with them and distributed them. They even gave them some police officers who guarded the place, which resulted in "some small clashes", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had beaten demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that due to this court order the new opening of the square for public transport and the demonstrators had been lifted. He pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation of the Zuccotti Square, which had been arrested almost 200 people in the morning, and was decided because the demonstrators "refused the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to clear up the place because he had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some shops had received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation in the dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement who accused the mayor of "not respecting the freedom of the press".
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organizing "great actions" for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been taking since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", woman of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson will appear together with the "crowner" (ballades singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will bring life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program, in which Anderson - also appearing for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a doll in his lap to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator on the show "My Violet Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears to be Jesus Child.
CTV's Christmas program is based not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé called North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake, which led to an nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster Japan had experienced on the 2nd World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo rated damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on gross domestic product from July to September finally concluded this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the rate calculated for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable growth.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or reconstruct infrastructure.
Japan has been awakened, particularly as a result of the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - fled into one of the "refugee currencies" of investors who were charged like a tombstone to the accounts of the export companies before the debt crisis of the Eurozone and the turbulent forecasts for the U.S.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, returned their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the Yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September most Member States showed clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator that presupposes the turning points of the world economy revealed that the biggest economic potentials had slowed down.
Because he sank by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens Again Brings Doubt
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high-level risk premiums of the peripheral countries and growing uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured him that he would support the new austerity measures and not in any case withdraw his request for new elections on the scheduled date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," said Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of the Disciplinary Law for officials and new measures to combat tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear up the doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to the support of the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader went one step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and he made it clear that he would not approve a commitment statement on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still annoyed by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu Referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that it was not necessary to change its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the Troika "very soon" came back to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is "necessary" for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has reached a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide".
Yesterday, the Spanish Queen Sofía reminded us that Spain has developed into a second donor for this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "Wesen" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind based on trust in men".
Yesterday the Queen inaugurated the fifth world summit on microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of the number of people who have to live with incomes of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit".
Spain "also continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, hoping that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which will last until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "are facing many challenges."
The summit on microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for launching "two fundamental goals".
The Queen stated that it was intended that 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit is based in Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia considers to be an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financial instrument described her as an "admirable idealist who had dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the spot.
This experience followed a year later the first world summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. "We have all been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen, whose commitment to this project brought her the assessment yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "chairman of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by animating those present to participate in the debate and looking for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical commandment" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind economic booms to development aid at times, as it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez felt that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy for eradicating poverty", and that the governments of the industrialised states should now work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim to it.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "who are always at the door of closed doors" "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that opened "their gates, infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the President of the EU on the basis of a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats Congress (CDU on Monday, November 14th in Leipzig) was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not foreseen in the programme, but it prevailed in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on Greeks today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's proposal for a Presidency, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation, which was initially valid for Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, was not open to any doubt on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, like the proposals, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a revision of the Treaty of Lisbon, strengthening the control of the European Union with regard to the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is certainly one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate clearly stood by.
Certainly it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the case, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates rejected the proposal of weighting of each country in the Governing Council according to the weighting of each economy, which obviously led to a first-fold increase in Germany's position.
The chancellor, based on calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the difficult European countries that would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
In so far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" is dedicated to a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in case of medical reports?
After family support, UMP and the government are now tackling the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and to present a speech on the theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the State, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy to a tough test, but on the other hand does not mean less foreshadowing an axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers' health reports.
First with budgetary objectives: the government is proposing the introduction of a fourth qualifying day before taking into account an accident report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the salary of four days without the consent of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to infuriate anger, but would help to bring in EUR 280 million.
And that with another measure was more symbolic: to grant state officials an unrequited carenzy day in the event of a disease (there is so far no qualifying period for them, unlike the three carenzy days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority of them are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time aiming at the abuse of work-related absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will be refunded if this is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, November 13th, in front of the station RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of disease reports appears to be somewhat disproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation since 2002 and of political offensives that have been the most fruitful.
The French are no longer sicker than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first stay with the nationwide numbers.
According to the CNAM National Health Insurance Fund, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of the Health Service, the daily payments in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros of 5% of health expenditure.
This figure included 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, the French were on average granted only 14.5 sick days compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
One average that conceals certain differences: another published in 2007 by Monster.com, the Career Planning website, pointed out that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers did not take a single sick day.
Another study covered this time by health insurance shows that 37% of the disease reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are thus no longer prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (founded by disease or other factors) was oscillating between 10% and 11% compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of medical reports represents a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak amount is achieved here.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatic controls in case of disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university of technical and engineering education and training) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 completed short-term medical reports, which is said to have been "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In the systematically controlled disease reporting cases of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were counted in "unadjusted or unwarranted" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this amounts to 169.000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have filed an accident report.
A point which represents only a weak measure compared to, for example, those of the blackwork.
According to the UMP member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between EUR 9 and EUR 15 billion of tax losses per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the amount of the debt in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the participation of the country within the eurozone "was at stake" as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's government deficit"by 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it amounted to 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but foresaw that his party would not qualify for an additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his new democracy party.
He had agreed to the targets for the reduction of budget deficit and debt, as well as for the fight against waste, but he was hostile to any policy that would hinder economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, Commissioner responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs, had prevented IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties on their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, such as an expert body
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain relief treatment to provide the best pain relievers, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a reluctance to death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually want to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice is made, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a starting point, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada has placed itself in the 10th place, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada tell us.
And despite the Canadian majority's desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate is highest in Quebec with 86% of hospitalized deaths.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are counter-productive to the position of the federal government, which has already exercised, not to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also inspected all those countries whose approach has legalised or decriminalised euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would result in abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations were encountered in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as was confirmed in a teleconference yesterday by Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support the Euthanasia
We note that, according to an Angus-Rid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already done so in favor of euthanasia, as they believe that at the end of their life they allow people to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not lead to conveying the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to those who have already practised an accompanied suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As regards the maintenance or discontinuation of the medicinal products in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the author of the report.
Similarly, in their list of recommendations, they suggest that the criminal law should specify that the removal of the funds for which a legally valid refusal was made should not be regarded as criminal.
The expert board also calls for health care professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a retirement of resources at the end of life, and this must be feared without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving drugs, and this goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the substances already widely used in the Canadian health care institutions for pain relief or life-absorbing measures, the body calls at least for consideration to be given to them, since they were as little used as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and focus on the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already submitted reservations as to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the reporting experts as "extrem", as they set no limits to the practice of euthanasia in the case of the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sphere of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly concerned with the reports on the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus pounces a "complott"
Syria is seen to be more isolated
The Bashar al-Assads partisans demonstrated in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, which, however, thanks to Russia's support and a "complot" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before Syria was eliminated by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the reigning Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Bashar al-Assad to do so, "to establish his office in Syria", in which forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Add to Bashar's interest in his country, he would resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighboring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he explained, alluding to Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey is taking a constantly harsher attitude.
The United States, for its part, welcomed the "encouragement of consensus against Assad and the acts of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"In the face of repression in Syria, the international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have struck an ever sharper tone," observed Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the besieged city of Homs in "Shoot Change and Heavy Bombings for Jobar".
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country "was taxing on the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added under the guise that "the plots forged against Syria would fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently examining a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of sending UN observers to stand by civilians from repression of the regime, after encroaching on his "Paranoia" to protect himself.
An extraordinary reconvening of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan on crisis crisis escalation adopted on 2 November, in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lawrow listed the Arab League's decision as "uncorrect" yesterday to prevent possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy ready for sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program requiring "victims" to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before the meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in Parliament, which is composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups who took part in the discussions, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had, in turn, been waiting for Mario Monti to put a vote of confidence before Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a strike list, which will undoubtedly extend from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness in the stock exchange and bond markets required her time.
In "democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he pointed out that it was "certain that markets would be slow and sensible".
His appointment by the President was welcomed by the beginnings of the markets, but the unrest had increased further, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister was to set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would like to include also "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive Parliament's evidence of confidence by Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working urgently to make Italy the "new protagonist" in Europe since it began its role.
A spokesperson from EU Commissioner Olli Rehn pointed out that "it does not change our diagnosis of the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government."
In particular, the EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the savings plans that have been undertaken in recent months, has requested new initiatives.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's Chief Executive, who will meet on Tuesday at Monti, is also concerned with the need for economic growth," because a country that has no growth to show is unable to respect the deficit indicators."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "Epoch Change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trust" and a "other Italy", according to the editorials.
The great unknown is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, as Italy has now raised State bonds for EUR 200 billion until April 2012.
Russian scientists are helping the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wyacheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-powered explosive capsule, so confirmed a nuclear risk specialist American NGO on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents derived from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the AIEA had announced its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to a detailed study of AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "Nano-Diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Prior to his return to Russia, he took part in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear fuel system had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who had not only been overly involved in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency said, had worked directly on the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin via his entire professional career."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated crimes of violence, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either declined slightly or have increased slightly in the same period.
According to this data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49%, while a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes directed against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes was recorded.
The total number of "hats-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a weakening in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," stressed the Human Rights Organization Human Rights First."The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," added the organization in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had stressed for a long time that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible member of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these abuses," he added, believing that this could be done by improving the police's attitude towards the "hat crimes".
The "hat crime" is represented in American federal law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after Martin Luther Kings' death to punish acts of violence directed against race, skin color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter transforms the platform and resembles more and more Facebook
The Twitter Microblogging website introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service resemble that of Facebook once more.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" tab allow you to better understand the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are being tracked and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out whether these allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August with a small percentage of users," said Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner in front of the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, endowed with somewhat esthetic graceful wording (RT to the referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiations, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus compatible a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation via the Internet with the help of certain "Tweets".
"This is useless, intrusive and resembles too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me track certain elements of my Flux Twitter better," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a "golden budget rule" into the Constitution
On Tuesday, the Austrian government in power of the great Social-Democratic/Christian Coalition decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in the Austrian Top-Bonity (AAA).
It was the Social-Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public debt of Austria is 74.6%, far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the level of debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's ability to pay was not reduced to a blow from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros of interest each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian-Democrat Foreign Minister.
Austria also makes a request for the Brussels Eurozone Member States Summit of 26 October: The Heads of State and Government would then have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to the public balance of accounts in the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to have incorporated such a "rule" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, while the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% GDP ceiling from 2017 onwards, while the regional and local authorities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eliminate household debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda is threatening a new intervention on the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the yen were to continue to rise, Japanese official power would again intervene in the currency markets.
If we find an excessive volatility in the Yen's exchange rate, we will intervene as we did the last time," said M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was again in a hurry to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31st.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollar to lower the Japanese foreign exchange value, which is setting a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has steadily increased over it, draped by purchases of investors who consider the yen to be "receivable" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped among the symbolic latte of 105 yen close to the levels that had captured the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
The Japanese currency's petrification fire damages the Archipelago's exports, since it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which have devastated the Tohoku region (north-east) for its reconstruction," says M. Noda, who fears that this cost of the yen could kill the weak upturn already in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter, the third world economic power has regained -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time this year thanks to the booming growth in exports and consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the Yen's cost does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
The Finance Minister, Jun Azumi, invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to destabilise the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the Institute, informed that the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures" which allowed him to say that no additional currency relaxation could be expected on Wednesday.
At the end of October, the central bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to cancel the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) cover amounts it had spent on various purchases of financial instruments to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rates speed up to the height, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The risk of infection of the debt crisis is constantly undermining European figures.
Despite the accession of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to increase steadily.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also operate this Tuesday, 15 November even a little more in negative terms.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions with regard to the yields of government bonds in the Eurozone in difficulty, global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
"The investors are nervous and only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the press agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which, for its part, suffers from the re-fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued to continue, closed with a deficit of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variety corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone damages the single currency, which continues its boss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it gave up 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it went back after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had accepted an application which provided, in particular, for countries in difficulty to withdraw from the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy's and Spain's interest rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% in 10 years, which matured to 6.2% of the Spanish title.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel investors' fears.
The future Italian head of government Mario Monti requested more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by paralysis from the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had in turn confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was the main task of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting euro area growth rates
Statistically, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office of INSEE had revised the bases of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts most.
Germany, on the other hand, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first euro area bill is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If an issue exists that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting to consider this issue as well as the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their views on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is driving forward a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, an enormous proportion of the world’s population is not to be deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be eased in order to continue to produce electricity without the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
Fukushima's accident doesn't change any of these parameters.
Germany therefore remained isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision on the need to find a substitutable substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
In contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States has decided, after Fukushima, to draw up a new unit for its park by re-establishing the Three Mile Island plant that was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, which is based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes set as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in electricity prices, an increase in energy dependence on Russia, in particular by increasing the use of imported gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will already become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity; on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill in contrast to our French households.
As the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability path for industry on national soils, French companies have an advantage because of the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the price of energy, which led to the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys showed that it is a price that the large majority of French people are less willing to pay, as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us note that the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 inducted jobs.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France were to take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, the majority of these SMEs would fall victim to it and the annual EUR 6 billion of exports of capital goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
What electrician would commission an EPR designed to function for sixty years if its producer's decline was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no miracle medium for the production of electricity as well as a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy reflect the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, entered normal operating conditions, so he left without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by a mass that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as of cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to withstand such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical technicians to build a nuclear power plant, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, allowing them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvring dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overburdening police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had influenced the weekly shows by the authority, and the Interior Minister had announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need any talent, maurer or waitress from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
From the right, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900.000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, are not likely to be a problem for a country", was left by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990 that France "could not absorb the entire poverty of the world".
The only difference is in the degree of growth.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
Immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that the immigrants are willing to face.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalities, which indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
Like the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the local labour force, especially the low-skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are, in fact, much more complementary than domestic wage earners, since they are mainly engaged in occupations in sectors that are technically unexploited.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors where local wage-earners do not travel much less, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the labour supply.
Positive pay effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, so this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect on the migration of immigrants to wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants causes a co-linked, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of native immigrants among American Nobel Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to the social systems, with an average of about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is a 30-year-old immigrant to Germany makes an average net contribution to the public household over his lifetime (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to produce the missing intersections with his teeth at the start of his term of office.
However, these said teeth, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had caused the whole of the 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Greek colonel.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to conquer democracy once and for all over their enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that this was a characteristic of the mind.
The general right to vote, which constitutes the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can as well become the "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a case law.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is also a major political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek false-truth referendum would have been double-discovered in this regard: once that the necessity of a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that today the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised according to the needs and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European single ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, out of full law, clarified and constantly, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which are suffering from its lack of power and its lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each and every one of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
For it is up to the whole community whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at European level, which cannot be made without total democratic justice, without surely ruining us.
After this proposal has been fought for a long time by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone today is urging European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - this would be a once again folly and another dead end.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not do enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards become the general good
The World Trade Fair for Chipcards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM cards telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reading device.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should increase even further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground with regard to contactless payment after it has long been behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming up.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, equipped with a contactless chip," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks Test Payment by Mobile Phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) needed to carry out these transactions.
"You're in default."
"But they should have a real upward trend at least next year."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also announced yesterday that it would prepare the launch of an offer that would allow its customers to pay without contact via mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands itself, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing relationship between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seems to confirm itself.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now become "certain about it".
"The way in which both organisations act and the relations of the secret services indicate clear cooperation," he explained without going into detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigations into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January have promoted interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, are said to have been killed at the same time on the following days as several of their abductors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several phone chips in the debris at the site of operation that belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the phone calls led to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one leads to a Nigerian who had stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but no doubt you have to wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem".
"But it's conceivable."
"It has been known for years that the sect has attracted financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that they are increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo mitigates.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly obvious in their course, as have the speeches and operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the withdrawal of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to begin with Washington has since exerted pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the grouping to be a community of Illuminati for a long time, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western Education is a disgrace" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this mediocre region, the merger is experiencing rapid successes.
It politicizes and demands strict adherence to the Sharia, while its affiliated activists engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in sight.
In 2009, Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their increased attacks on the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, however, as usually indicated.
The army surrounds the city, there are 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, who was taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assassination in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was assigned the blame of a suicide bombing that took place in Abuja's secured police headquarters - the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia has alarmed all security experts ever since.
While Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger to operate the Somalis of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria and showed himself ready to "speak all the clues".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-impaired America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements and their statements on foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
There are slogans about China, Iran and Israel - often in no way underpinned - aid.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" which is the highest in the course, Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of "cash manipulation" - the leading theme in an America that is most intrigued by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
He said it was stupid if this were to imply the start of a trade war.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost deflected the air with regard to his emotions flattering gesture.
He had called for a firm but constructive exchange of views with Beijing (also the current Obama attitude).
But Huntsman is not being heard because he is stagnating in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Eponymous
Romney had also praised military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran," he had spoken.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest-ranking candidate, is showing a shameful documentary.
Recently, he called for the Chinese military threat to be countered, since Beijing was "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to pay more attention to the fact that China has already owned military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and demands military battles against Iran, exacerbates himself to be prepared to employ the American army against drug cartels in Mexico.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, Republican candidate in 2008, an external gravity.
The current presidential opponents object that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War in spite of all of them.
They recalled that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, which concerned the issue of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive intercession with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boy" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the call of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so coercive.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding itself against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised more appropriately by arguing that America had to be reconstructed economically in order to revitalize its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea seabed and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to perform this event with brilliance and Gloria.
Over 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly below sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast with orchestral sound and fine-tasting buffet.
German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have symbolically turned together the load of the valve, which carries the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km long, connecting the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - will be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the possibility of building a third line begin on the track itself.
For Gazprom, the timely and point-to-point completion of this huge building seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream pipeline will allow for direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of their power: it is now more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, was not shy away from comparing the North Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that, politically speaking, the subject is too sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through its support for this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of a decarbonisation of European energy, as the project has made a breakthrough between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits tend to decline in just under five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," said François Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are also politically and economically important.
All of this explains the wide smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The submerged line consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
Mining fields dating from the Second World War had to be eliminated during their construction.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed carefully," said Jens Müller, spokesperson of Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off Sweden's coast, but the project managers have declined because the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company settle in a permanent manner at the height of their coasts.
"In the event of a breakdown, we close the gas flow in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
So in the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors to be less likely, as the welding seams were estimated to be resistant to one leak per 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a seaship, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measures a meter in diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipe and moved through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of transit through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five societies have joined forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French company group GDF Suez (each 9%) are affiliated here.
These five companies have formed a group of companies called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to this company, on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real volume of gas transported will fall," Jens Müller explained.
The financing of the gas pipeline was secured to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
Total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges on a sandy, forested coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a trademark notebook.
Founded about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine now wants to give the writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, with candlelight spent with writing hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell sides, as over time aged.
However, the Moleskin notebook, as is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at the time to place on the market a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, at the time specialist consultant of the company, is commissioned to launch the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (Mole Skin) which describes a cotton varnish used for coverings of upholstery benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was regarded as an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand-responsible at Modo Modo.
Success is coming.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% and established themselves with a sales volume of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small, Italian company, which in its beginnings numbered 12 employees, employs over 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on web portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of city centers and understands how to enforce its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new need for writing, which exists despite the upswing of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exposure called "Detour" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood to diversify his products: bags, appointment calendar, fillers, computer shells... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that engenders the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought up by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a determined public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, which is organising the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but tripled."
"Nevertheless, much remains to be done."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for disabled people before they get a job.
Older people are more common: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% of them do not have a diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with 38% for the total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
Keep the unspoken, the spiritual attitudes, which, though certain, but still continue slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated that the managers surveyed "have a weak level of knowledge about the disabled", which was "overrepresented" by people in wheelchairs, mental or intellectually impaired persons.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Proof: The number of "fees paid" establishments has decreased, as has the sum of the sums paid up between 2007 and 2011, from 59.000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real awareness, especially of the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments employ disabled workers between 20 and 49, while enterprises with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard:"What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue Tuesday evenings" (20:45) the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasures that brought them the game of friendship.
It would have been too far-fetched to claim that there had been a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the audience stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been happy to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the native Liller on his part.
As to the contrast between his presentation in Club and National Elf "It is a unity that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium".
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France to finally "glaze".
However, without neglecting the note of "rejoicing".
The French national team fired him since he was 7 years old, and he led his victorious campaign between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily helps to strengthen the "unique" character of this encounter even more.
So much in advance:"Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he says.
"We just crossed the road."
"To allow them to play means great happiness!"
Leekens, on the other hand, sounded with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride of wearing a gala match."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his capacity as a "neighbouring child" - that France" has once again become a team at a very high level", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will very well see the plane sharing with the Blues (the French national elves) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he emphasized.
"We're planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento is looking forward to the return game against Bosnia this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the play, both teams had missed out on the subject.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf for whom he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that really means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in Zenica Hell, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game over more than an hour, but the team was unable to press on the matter the so important stamp that had taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not achieved an exit door".
At home, however, in its brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is equally hot at the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close," said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but are absolutely convinced to be able to win the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance at the 2012 European Championship", however, Carlos Queiroz's successor relativised.
The decision on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a goal.
A decision can already suffice for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we have not reached an exit door," says Bento.
"We will fight a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would have expected to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning so as not to give them time to think."
A good idea, assuming that it is put into practice this time.
