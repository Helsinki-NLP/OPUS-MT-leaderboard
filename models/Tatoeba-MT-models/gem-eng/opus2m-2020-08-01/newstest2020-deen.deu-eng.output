Fire deleted in French chemical work
The fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the north-French city of Rouen has been wiped out. The prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Borderers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the Chemiewerk on the banks of the Seine are made additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people work at the plant. The chemical factory already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methane escaped and the environment smoked widely after lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to seek 57 days for her missing bitch
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had left the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the bitch every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had panicked the dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie had immediately run out. Probably a loud thunder had panicked the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. However, weeks were spent. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The Tears Swallowed"
57 days after Katie’s disappearance, Carole King received a phone call: a man reported himself and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly stood her bitch under a tree. “I only hugged her. I didn’t want to let her go,” King remembered according to “Daily Inter Lake”. “The tears flowed. The people stopped in their vehicles, got out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her”.
Losses at the Bundeswehr: Machine guns disappear without a trace
Friday September 27th, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of shotgun ammunition. Among them are also three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" extent.
At the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition disappear again and again - many of them so far untracked. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 bullet ammunition. This is due to a list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which the editorial network Germany reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon part and 3474 bullet ammunition have been re-emerged. The weapons and weapon parts that have disappeared are, among other things, six MG3 machine guns, eleven G3 type G3, four G36 type guns, six P8 type pistols and two P8 type pistols. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the German Bundeswehr was "anxious," said left-federal member Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since in the course of investigations hardly anything had been found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "poor balance". Renner criticised that the listing was not recognizable as to whether under the lost ammunition there were also those who had been found in the investigations against the federal officer Franco A. under suspicion. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday today. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was the destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but initially he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipping company it was said that one wanted to wait for an official report from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" had been accused of violating security regulations by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Strait. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the Gibraltar belonging to the UK.
Hormuz road is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped through the oceans. The tensions in the region have become immensely intense in recent months. The trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Merkel commends the courage of the people during the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has acknowledged the commitment of the people in the GDR who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989 courageous citizens would have weakened the then GDR regime, said Merkel at a ceremony of the Thuringian CDU faction on the coming day of German unity in Erfurt. The chancellor recalled among other things the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken by terror," she said.
Musk strives for a delivery record
Tesla's quarter may keep record. Despite the delivery boom, there were last losses at the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers have to be generated for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from tickling themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress has also been made on the question of why children are so fiercely fighting the kitzel, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter before the touch. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers laughter at the expectation of the kitzel.
According to earlier research, rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound field when they are tickled by humans. This "laugh" is conveyed by the part of the big brain, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smile is suppressed during self-movement
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-contact and touch by others - that is why people cannot tickle themselves. However, the Berlin researchers found in the experiments on rats that laughter, as well as the activity of the relevant area of the grand brain, is suppressed during a self-movement. This is also true if living beings wash themselves. During the foreign touch and tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been increased but laughed.
But if the self-movement and the touch by others at the same time pass by, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the brain of the rat cannot distinguish between the self-movement and the touch by others. The new findings suggested that humans cannot tickle themselves because the self-movement activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats had also been trained to tickle themselves. Thus, in the experiment, they sometimes interrupted this initiation in advance, showed fleeing behavior or fearsome rigidity. This ambivalence is the same as the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great Fire in French Chemical Works Deleted
The fire in a chemical plant in the north-French city of Rouen, which was particularly dangerous, was wiped out. The prefecture of the Normandy told the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should have been released. The samples taken do not give any cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was used with about 200 fire brigade vehicles.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

The chemical factory has already provided headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methane was leaking and the surrounding area was widely smoked for lazy eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first session in Parliament after the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
About Cox, who had worked for Britain's stay in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to reunite this country would have been to take the EU exit."Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Monument to the attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 dead people on Saturday in Norway, a memorial is unveiled in honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Cathedral in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims' relatives. Among other things, the opening is expected by Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On 22 July 2011, the right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first launched an auto bomb in the Oslo government district and, following the Utöya Island, killed dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the Youth Organization of the Social Democratic Workers Party. In total, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Releases British Tankers
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But there is now a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to go back to sea in Iran. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has been held in the streets of Hormus in Iran since mid-July. After being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Sena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" had left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now drove, among other things, for medical investigations to Dubai, explained shipowner Erik Hånell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "Good that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a Friday communication.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had determined the tanker on 19 July under the pretext of having failed to comply with the rules of the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were in a good position, said Hånell. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhilarating situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": At the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been destined for Syria, had been put on the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities opposed EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received a reference to the ship from the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assuming it was a trade to free the "Stena Impero", London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important maritime roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. The tensions in the region have become immensely intense in recent months. The trade shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents have occurred with tankers and drones.
Iran rejects the tension between Tehran and Washington, the nuclear battle between the two countries. The Americans are proposing to the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. In 2018, the United States alone had stepped out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has been putting pressure on the leadership of Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and extended agreement in other areas. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Due to the dispute over the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the streets of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign defence powers, wanted to ensure the safety of the Persian Gulf shipping.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war-winner". In view of the criminal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves. Financial leaders of Asian companies who are considering shifting their production from China to another country call India in a survey of UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This does not only have to do with the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a huge pool of young workers as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created as a way to play a more important role in the global wide-broadened production chain.
But now India itself has become in Trump's focus. Devalued by the Haudegen in the White House as the "kingdom of customs", America has deprived the emerging country of the trade promotions for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The USA accuses India of proactively high tariffs and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of the trade wars, however, the frictions with India are merely a sideline. America also sees the world’s largest democracy through the Security Policy spectacles. Delhi and Washington link the concerns about China’s power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a ointment of American criminal tariffs against India is unlikely to occur. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just started a second five-year term, is therefore likely to weigh in safety.
However, the problem lies in a different location: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets are accelerating economic development has a difficult situation in the socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. His reformist spirit is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic error that suffocated in the multi-ethnic state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies are now receiving rapid construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more cumbersome insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for seemingly fast liquidating high-debt companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics has made a great deal of progress in the first five modes. However, this does not apply in trade policy. In order to protect low-competitive companies from foreign suppliers internationally, the National Conservative Government has even created new barriers.
In the West, the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country, is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. At the heart of the "India First" lawyer, however, never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dispose of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive through the cut-off of their industries are among the tribal voters of Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and are blaming this short-sighted policy.
Consignment of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is expected to be buried in Paris next week. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, reported the AFP news agency, calling on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. For Sunday, a public funeral was scheduled in the Paris Invalidity, as media reported.
Carrying the competitors to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The world's top has long been in the finish when the cooled-down Khalifa International Stadium was playing heartwarming scenes. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could hardly hold on to his feet more than 300 meters in front of the goal, running in an unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly interrupted him and dragged him to the finish with the last half of the stadium round. The forces were still sufficient for both to stop the participating watch after the finish run. As if the scene had not been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the assembled journalists. He left first, didn't want to talk about his heroic act at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Federation for the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have been allowed to start. "That's why I am proud to walk here for my country," he said.
He did this with emphasis on the evening - and much more intense than he would have thought. Because this heroic act will be remembered. Zummal Dabo even left his competitors Busby in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well over five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead. In the end, it had nothing to do with it, because the busby, which came only with much help, was disqualified at the end of the World Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, started to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data, although he managed to do so at 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already there". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions of Masks: Egyptians Armed for Wild Protest Day
In Egypt security measures have been reinforced in the run-up to possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Last few days, the police had strengthened their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opposer of Al-Sisi
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been hundreds of protests against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali living in exile, who played the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "millionaire march" in central places in the country today. Ali demands a "people revolution". For most young Egyptians, the man is not a "good man" because he was a sub-contractor for the army, but his messages arrive.
According to the protests, the number of arrests was increased by two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organisation (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed at first. The government confirmed and did not comment on the figures either.
Random arrests
Many people had been "wildly arrested", "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW announced under appeal to lawyers arrested. The accusations against the arrested range from "proliferation of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the security forces interviewed and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW data, also randomly passersby.
HRW also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: shippers should be able to make returns easier
For online dealers, many returned parcels are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the garbage. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While it is not possible to exempt companies from VAT on donations of goods, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green Bundestag faction, about which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday. However, traders could set the market value of the unsale returns so low that they would have to pay no or only little VAT.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that when ordering on the Internet, the German citizens would return every sixth package. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - would then end up in garbage. They would be donated by companies according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities would evaluate donations in kind like a turnover that would be subject to VAT.
The Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies cannot properly evaluate products for sale and can donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online sales, but also to other shops from fashion shops to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There never was a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksys's work underlines "the re-establishment of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3rd. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had once again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, called "Question Time", was renamed "Devolved Parliament".
The picture could change the owner for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard-hit exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the House of Commons after a forced pause imposed by Johnson had been lifted by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to do the twice-moved Brexit on 31 October, if necessary, even without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, gets involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks with a chisel a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not, in his opinion, contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy was a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will leave the EU and we will win."
Johnson had brutally attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and accused them, among other things, of "confidence" to the people. Accusations that he could jeopardize the Members because they could be targeted by threats of murder, he did so as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest was if the MEPs finally respected the decision of the British to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were upset that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the excited mood, even the bishops of the Church of England called for restraint on Friday. "We should speak with respect," it was stated in a statement. "And we should listen too".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, said Khan on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this goes badly, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have been responsible for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have waged three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had removed the state of autonomy of the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the overthrow of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It fires the population with sharp ammo, more than 2000 prisoners join the prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already in there. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. However, since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything in its power to avoid a scenario like at Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by one’s own government drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that el-Sisi’s regime cannot handle, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, every third party in Egypt is living below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who he is financing: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty in delivering a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in terminal: BER-Chef: No more "showstopper" for capital airport
Two months have been examined whether the complex interconnectivity of BER fire protection is working. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there were still deficiencies in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large. The construction production indicator is now due to be submitted to the building office during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of defects in power cables still need to be corrected, and the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for the take-up of the flight operation, work must continue to be done intensively to address the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all the duvets on which the cable routes hang. The airport manager expects this to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the transition to the station below the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis already three years ago. This time it is about smoking aprons that come down like a canvas on a fire, so that the smoke does not spread. They are going down too far. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree hedges and planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was to start operation in 2011. Since the start of construction in 2006, costs have increased from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros to the opening next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers are planning to expand the airport. That is why the Supervisory Board will attend a special meeting on 18 October, as the Chairman of the Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial manager Heike Fölster changes to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, personnel manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put airport finance on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Vending machines for drugs blown up - Police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased a number of vending machines into the city of Chemnitz! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket engines bombed in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police seized a 33-year-old German on Bürgerstraße and on Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation of the conduct of explosives explosions in an act unit with a particularly severe case of the theft conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-olds was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the loot, he apparently financed his addiction to drugs."The bomber only blew up parking tickets on the Bürgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation, and the police investigation against him continues.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is implementing its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price struggle with low cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa’s daughter AUA takes over “the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna”, confirmed on Friday a press speaker from Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, AviationNetOnline had reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Flyer Eurowings will be dissolved de facto. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. From January 2020, the AUA will take over the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, said the speaker. Flight times should be coordinated on connecting flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the Vienna hub and, on the other, to expand the decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as a "Production Company" for the Group sister AUA. For example, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight attendants would come from Eurowings. According to the report, Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number will no longer be completed in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport a price struggle broke out after the Niki Pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that next summer the fleet in Vienna would increase on 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost pilot will send four Ryanair machines, including crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "wetlease", which criticised the union as a bypass to the collective agreement.
In five years, the Battle of Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary said that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in response on Friday's AUA Chief Executive Andreas Otto: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Uncle Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the early months of the Italian holidays, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have stopped at the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the Palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to actually be married," the couple, who have been together since October 2018, announced in the official announcement.
And on: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the years to come this will help us very much."
Sister Eugenie clipped the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will be announced to the palace in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a celebration of the same size as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or an attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the genetics of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the genetics of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking region, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the Zurich University Hospital, is involved.
Obesity, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the main influencing risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete genetic heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1000 former patients of the University Heart and Vascular Center at the UKE.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes have known changes in DNA - so-called mutations - causing disease. Each year, about 200 are added.
The aim of the five-year project is to promote the development of new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other people’s diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, Head of the University Heart and Vascular Center. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as on cancer diseases are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong desire to use the data for research into other diseases. So far, the hospital of the Foundation in Davos deals mainly with allergies. Now, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be established on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created. To justify his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur living in Switzerland said that he had been operated on the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and very gratefully.
The biosamples of the healthy participants are from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, according to the clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In heritology, strict attention is paid to the protection of the anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of data, said Holger Moch of the University Hospital in Zurich.
Today, according to the UKE, the heritage of a human being can be deciphered within 24 hours. The actual cost of this is 1300 euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is due to start on 1 October, and all 9000 samples are to be analysed by the end of 2020. In the following year, the first results are expected.
Nigerian police freed hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have liberated more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran School. Security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the still minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys had been held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "improved". In fact, the guards had been held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred pupils, including children at the age of nine, had been chained in a small space.
According to the Koran School, it has been reported for about ten years. Residents would have alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran School, said Sabo. They had not known about the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran Schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. The people in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Aid Agency, over 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police freed 400 children from school
Policemen in a school in northern Nigeria have liberated nearly 400 students from terrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that point to torture," said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after a hint in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "unworthy". The officials arrested the headmaster and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept at their school as slaves and put on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed demaculated and injured students in a recognizable poor health condition.
World football selection: Further accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the world football association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. Lionel Messi is the sixth honor and thus the record.
After Nicaraguan captain declared that he had never voted in the world football election, accusations came from other countries to the fifa. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious reason.
In recent years, much of the fifa has proved to be a source of remorse: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Cup election has not yet been suspected of running away unsuitably - if one refrains from the fact that the qualified national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often agree on sympathy rather than on objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, there are now further inconsistencies: Egypt complains that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not appear in the official and publicly visible vote list.
The fifa apologizes to the fact that "the signatures on the electoral forms were given in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without a response.
Sudan's coach is also amazed
While the situation in the case of Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese Association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was as well, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Assaults had also been raised by Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Did not vote for the #TheBest2019 awards. All details about my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
The news came from the association on Friday: True, but of course no intention. The completed election documents had been provided "in error" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, it was said in a communication from the association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", it was stated in the communication. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "in exactly the way it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the fifa to be examined in an investigation, but emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long, Lionel Messi remains undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp world coach of the year.
Ukraine business: Ranghohe Republicans speak out for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly voted for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that leads from here is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the activities of democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine. According to Scott, Trump observed Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, and few have been disappointed by it. Scott’s comments are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the bottom."
Scott and Baker, as governor of the U.S. federal states, have not formally joined the trial against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their comments are therefore symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. In the midst of Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Parliamentary chamber, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could lead to the initiation of an anti-trump procedure, and the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation. They suggest to him abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the withdrawal procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the democrats could make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. Up to now, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally controlled the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board. After violent protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
New serious accusations against rockets are now being made. Three men who are being charged with torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicilian) after migrants had recognized their penitentiaries in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any guaranteed information about it," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben, new builder of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Muhammad C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to atrocities - through repeated and constant physical violence," it was said in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot exactly know who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why the people of Libya are fleeing. It is therefore quite likely that the perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that they follow this."
Italy's right-wing ex-minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk strives for a delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US budgetary dispute: Only bridge financing once again
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States are once again in favour of the new fiscal year starting on 1 October without spending plans. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided to continue with the resolution (CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shut-down on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to put the decision into effect.
Shutdown Denied
The Federal Government is now temporarily financed at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the financial year 2019 ending on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot benefit at the outset from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. $.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. Conversely, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve spending plans more or less, which are hardly a majority.
The spirits differ mainly on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans apparently try to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The democrats interfere with the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall construction had escalated already in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall construction, the spirits differ
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the next seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21st is not excluded.
Against the background of the persistent inability of Congress to agree in time on the twelve spending laws, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas to automate the process of popularity. Proposal p. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, hinder the travel activity of parliamentarians and keep their wages back until the new annual spending plans are in place.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilisation is to be open to women and lesbians living alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilisation, which should increase the demand for anonymous seed donations significantly.
The presentation still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core element of a bioethics law, which defends health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It depicts the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to their idea, the cost of artificial insemination for all women is to be borne by social security.
Infused with sperm by dead husband further prohibited
On the other hand, by a limited majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which would allow widows to have access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is permitted. In Germany, there were cases in the past in which women in vain complained about the shedding of the sperm of a deceased person. The opponents of the advances in Paris argued that such a fathered child would then have a "very severe fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had opposed the artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if her husband's death left unfulfilled with her children's wishes.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can in future be fertilised with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with her own partner.
So far, the artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot witness children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the leniency would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - yet it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: Calls for air tax for Unis are getting louder
A lot is being flown to the universities, which is why the country intends to have a climate tax levied there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under internal pressure.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate about a climate tax on flights from universities and universities before the summer break began to start again. After the regional rectors conference had sceptically responded to a similar advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now received support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university plead for compensation for service flights. This was the first step "necessary", at the same time there had to be a wide debate on the prevention of flights, according to their opinion. The initial cabinet decision planned in July is still on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again catches North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time, there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injured ones, it was called.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages, so the North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguards travel there according to their own data to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30.000 squid confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 squid had been detected and confiscated on the boats. In addition, the data were confiscated by three fishing and two motorboats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authorities had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
In future only 18,000: USA lowers the upper limit of asylum
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world shoots off the search for protection: As confirmed by the Washington Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the upper limit for the legal entry of refugees is further reduced. In the future, especially threatened believers and Iraqis should receive asylum.
In 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the admission of new refugees. As the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, the limit is still set at 30,000 people in the almost-past marketing year.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the willingness to accept protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, far higher reception limits had been imposed.
The recommended upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the launch of the US Refugee Programme in 1980. The Foreign Ministry nevertheless called the US "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the language of the President-in-Office of the United States.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to allow refugees to return to their countries of origin to help rebuild them, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening removal process.
The US government intends to focus on the inclusion of two groups of refugees, people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Foreign Ministry's statement states. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The US wants to achieve that especially people from this "northern triangle" of Central America are seeking asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to curb immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders the release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan female has been transferred to an animal collection station in the United States at the request of the Argentine court from the former Buenos Aires Zoo. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock Zoo was granted the rights of an "inhuman person" and therefore its release was mandatory. The animal was taken to Dallas by direct flight on Thursday evening - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo bay, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms heavy human fiend is unable to adapt to the wild life, it is to live in the future in the open air of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orang Utans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. Before entering Florida, however, "Sandra" still has to survive a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, Kansas, U.S. state.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal protectors has contributed to the conversion of the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023 a research and education site is to be established there to preserve biodiversity.
Record for Swiss climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The climber Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new Husar ride at the almost 3000-metre-high Big Tin in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-metre-high north wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the ascent. Thus, he prohibited the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit increase. Net profit rose to 1.4 billion dollars in the past quarter (just under 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly addresses its customers online.
Revenue rose to 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike’s sales figures increased with an increase of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Group from Beaverton in the US state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directing itself to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People’s Republic of Oregon.
Financial Manager Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike would continue the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus came from Brazil had been insulted by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@oficialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing with AS Rome since 2016.
The club responded on late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly Italian fans scandalise racist insults against black players rival teams. "We can't have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. One must identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The reason for the statement was racist songs at the first league party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on last Sunday.
However, there had also been recent discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now proven 38 randling fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to stop entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. For the rest, bans of four to seven years apply.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups in Juventus' environment. The twelve are accused of severe extortion, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigations with an advertisement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind the black market with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan basket and should have blackmailed Juventus staff to get to cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - entire vintages are conceived with catchy names. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" This call officially launched on September 21st at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also introduced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Public Relations Department.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothills of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's great natural environment offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun have already started to breed crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crabs industry has developed into a distinctive sector that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun’s economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued a large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers’ incomes.
In recent years Gaochun has launched a reform on "distribution of power, optimisation of administration and of public services" and has carefully built up the service network for "licensing under one roof, a law enforcement team, a network for services, a credit allocation platform". Thus, the city wants to fully optimize the environment for permits, services and development.
Gaochun takes full advantage of the advantages offered on the ground by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui and uses the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a signpost to establish intelligent high-end production plants, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, as well as organic farming companies leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, all-area tourism area and tourist areas of national importance. This has included the ecological and cultural resources of the Gaochun countryside, the state of the buildings for civil services and public services, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ Tourism" and the development of high-quality cultural tourism. It is worth looking forward to the future of Gaochun.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iran’s President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer by the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States had put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
US President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "The Iranian wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the situation as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions to be terminated has been discussed. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this advance had not been made in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. Given the applicable criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week Chancellor Angela Merkel had met with Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Iran with Russia and China. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel at the margins of the UN General Assembly, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After the Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. Thus, there is growing concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region from Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared to tremble, said Istanbul’s Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built homes fall into – including mortar made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly rock Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have for years warned that large open spaces registered as refuges in the center have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Beeben in August had the architectural engineering chamber of Istanbul warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the earthquake of Thursday was in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. TRT’s state station showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students cried out as they could see on images.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder that marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7,1 to 7,4 might threaten strength. However, when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. During the earthquake on Thursday, it already hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called go-bags with all the necessities next to the house doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth is shaking. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to these figures, two mosque minarettes fell into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyar.
Warning before aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users reported panic. Buildings wobbled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned against aftershocks via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the date of the quake, official information is given at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a aftershock, which was indicated with a thickness of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was only on Tuesday that an earthquake of 4,6 had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was up to Istanbul to feel. His epicenter was also located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority told Afad already on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge itself - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It had become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a major earthquake," Ersoy said to the transmitter. "In the past or later, the great quake will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake caused great anxiety in Istanbul too. In Albania, there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. Also on Lake Constance this year the earth had trembled.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine
Two fragile documents provide for new fuel in Ukraine's business for possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible removal of office, the U.S. democrats see themselves strengthened: the complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous adviser and its controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President provides important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "witch hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
USA: Passenger of United Airlines locked in toilet - Flight diverted
Because a passenger was detained in the board toil, a flight has been rerouted from United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, the airline announced according to US media.
In the event of an unplanned stopover on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour if she had been locked in it, US media wrote under appeal to other passengers. To proceed towards San Francisco, passengers had to change the machine.
In an online video that is supposed to come from flight 1554 according to US media, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We're currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says one man in it. The airline apologized to all passengers. At first, it was open whether the woman received compensation.
The cockroache: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the entire Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about Brexit Chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but is now at once the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the people's will into action and is determined to let nothing stop him and no one.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers are blatantly lying like once the Soviet leaders, when Brexitians in high positions virtually flee the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to that: write." By McEwan, only in the spring of the novel "Machines like me" appeared about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's first published story in 1915 is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turned into an immense monster," is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually goes down. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands his head," said the Diogenes publishing house.
EU invests EUR 9.5 million in Austria's rail infrastructure
11.200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary get whisper brakes to reduce noise pollution caused by freight trains. In addition, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this should make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German tour operator Thomas Cook cancelled all the travels until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency. Travel could not "be started for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday evening.
Bookings by the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or paid for. As it stands for travel with start from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had entered the parish of the British mother group and had filed on Wednesday insolvency. The company, which includes, among other things, Neckermann's travels, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to send hotels back money from now on
From this Friday, however, hotels abroad, which are currently hosting Thomas Cook holidays, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers are no longer required to receive extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without presenting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman from the German press agency said. "This applies immediately and on condition that Thomas Cook travellers from these hotels are not immediately required or otherwise required to pay individual hotel bills," said Bernd Engelien.
The insurance therefore responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their own accommodation on site according to their own information. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, the insurance spokesperson said on Friday will be in agreement with the insolvent travel provider. According to information from Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured holiday and return of Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are currently on the move. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly on holiday only, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel by including October 31 would be cancelled. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left the company open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance company, the further procedure was examined, it said. Basically, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and use a web form to assert their claims.
Prince Harry destroyed Sprengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana’s commitment. In Africa, he is now walking right on his mother’s trail.
Dressed with a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry lit and destroyed a mine in Angola.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit on Friday morning in front of running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the savanna landscape, without damaging it. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same warlord who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to take the path she was going at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a cleared minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust demonstrated.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of a no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made a clear determination: with him there will be no third postponement of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are made by the polarizing British people for an eternity. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a Damocles sword over the blond shovel. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to complete his Brexit course until the date of withdrawal has been cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring about an extension of bilateral talks by 31 October in the event of failed negotiations with the EU. Johnson had, however, been categorically excluded again and again.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But pressure does not seem to pass Johnson either. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made clear that in the event of a non-agreement, he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks later, the EU and the British negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without agreements. However, the recent talks again have not been successful. An agreement by the end of October appears to be rather difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a further postponement of the date of withdrawal will come into force. However, the opposition does not believe the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no deal.
US authorities: Other deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injured persons in this context, the US Health Agency announced the CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 people affected, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been known so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the US.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The building contractor and actor living in Spain demanded a "people's revolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, who accused critics of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hoped for mass demonstrations with a million participants in central squares of the country.
The security authorities are in any case alerted. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, streets around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in the past few days the police had reinforced their street controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians had partially searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura there had been hundreds of protests. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. Accordingly, the security forces reacted to it. According to the Human Rights Organization (HRW), almost 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arbitrarily arrested - only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW, under appeal to lawyers, reported arrests.
The organization also criticised censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocked websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamic president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed by Skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" on his arrival in the port of Hamburg.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement was a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He had waited many years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas. The expedition had, among other things, been measured with a drone of Greenlandic glacier and fished with nets after microplastics.
In the context of the Hamburg climate week, the Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all of us who love the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades."
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euros for pasta
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near Engelsburg in Rome: That seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill with 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered heated reactions.
"These cases damage Rome's reputation. We ask the police to consider whether this is a fraud," demanded a spokesman for Federagit, the Association of Travel Guides in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women not only ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this cannot be taken out of the bill. Also, a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, said the host landlord.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an office withdrawal procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is said to be open to the public. The accusation of the Whistleblower, who has finally made the conversation out of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint, is monstrous: the president had abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election in 2020. He had exploited Ukraine’s dependence with extortion, thus forcing them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be understood in the now published note of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not represent the full text. However, the phone call of 25 July is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center beside Trump is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story starts from the public's perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are fragile. "We don't mix in a choice, we mix in an investigation into what we have the right to do," he says. One could think it was inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants investigations to be pursued in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could prove to be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former mayor of New York seems to have infected himself with right conspiracies fixed on Trump's counter candidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the United States. However, this accusation was never to be taken seriously.
This is precisely the investigation that Trump will be talking about on the phone with Selenskyj on July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: The former vice president and currently promising candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine’s commissioner of the Obama government, has pushed for the release of the then Ukrainian general prosecutor Viktor Schokin. And in order to stop the investigation of the gas company that he is responsible for, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was working. Biden senior had financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up the corrupt actions of his family.
In fact, the procedure was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general had to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Also, Schokin himself was deeply accused of corrupt gesture, the US government was by far not the only Western partner who pushed for his dismissal. Incidentally, the Obama government even explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive interferences with Instagram and Facebook. According to this, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website alleretyren.de, users report that Facebook has not been charging again and again since about 3:30 p.m. Also Instagram reports that content could not be loaded. Also, Whatsapp seems affected by the disorder, although not to the same extent.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had been lost for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users mainly resort to Twitter to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were on the way with a tugboat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station since 1977, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: smartphone NOT wirelessly charging
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi-standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since just a few new smartphones have arrived on the market, which support wireless charging and sell very well - first of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call a study to mind from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the findings of the University of Warwick, this is extremely damaging for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat output. If you load a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the phone is slightly next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only suffers from capacity but also does not last for so long. Thus, the lifetime is less than expected. The researchers therefore recommend always charging the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange with modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has even increased the cost of a battery exchange once more - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is very convenient: simply put the device on a suitable charging path - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and laborious plug-in. Since Qi (represents inductive energy transmission) is a global standard, which exceptionally even includes Apple, there are few restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest statue photographer: 13 eight-thousands in six months
According to a Nepalese climber, 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world have climbed within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) had reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer announced.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight-thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He already made international headlines: From him comes a viral photo of climbers standing on Mount Everest Snake in the spring.
The image of the crowd triggered a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May eleven climbers had died on the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the ascent of the 14th millennium: Currently, the Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, among other things, bad weather is called. At the beginning of week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four Dead Elephants Discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police officer announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited the former fortress of Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police officer. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously held themselves harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This happens mostly when the animals move through nearby their habitats.
According to Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants still live. The death penalty is theoretically due to their killing.
United Kingdom oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after he was arrested by Iran. According to the news agency IRNA, the Bandar Abbas announced this to the maritime department. Iranian Revolutionary Guards had imposed the British flag tankers on 19 July under the pretext of violating the rules of the Law of the Sea in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The responsible Economic Committee of the House of Commons wants to examine the plight of the giant traveler Thomas Cook in detail. It is intended to deal with the board's salary packages as well as the question of why the UK government would not be able to help the surviving company financially. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external accountants," said Rachel Reeves in London. "It seems that we have a bad example of management greed."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in intestinal cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family increased intestinal cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as familial dietary habits are likely to weigh more heavily than previously assumed. This has consequences for calculations of the individual intestinal cancer risk, emphasizes the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". Demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the customer. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95’000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400,000 cars. Six-digit numbers are required for this in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is needed, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does the British government want to bypass Brexit law? Johnson withholding
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for ways of circumvention of the law recently passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a similar question, he simply said to journalists on Friday that his government would abide by applicable law.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement of the withdrawal date, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" in order to circumvent the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the post-EU period.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement."
Iran seems to be driving up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of willingness to take concrete action," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference on the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York. In case they did not stand by their promises, he put forward "further steps" away from the agreements of the 2015 agreement that were laboriously negotiated.
Background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, in return, contained the commitment to Tehran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States alone came out of the agreement to force Iran to change its course in the near-host policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump’s government intends to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and, in the meantime, to impose tougher sanctions on Tehran. Iran has recently reacted with a rise in uranium enrichment limited to the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing the construction of more than 300 further centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of oppressive US sanctions, probably Rohani. However, there will still be further talks that hopefully brought about a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huti rebels in Yemen, supported by Iran, had known themselves about the attack, but what was regarded by the United States as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rohani said. "The European leaders would not have been able to do so during the talks with him during the UN General Debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen not to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, Rohani asked the government in Washington to change to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This has been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions to be drawn on other solar systems.
What was initially only a guess is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The distant comet had been discovered on 30 August by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up of various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellar object, which was sighted when our solar system passed through.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get near insights into a strange solar system before it disappears on never again. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun," said Davide Farnocchia of the US space authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis, the comet is on the way on a so-called hyperbola track that takes it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origins, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tails, which had initially been led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in flight. Thus, researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium sized telescopes by April 2020," said Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already visited the visitor. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first investigation. Pictures of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear tail of the comet.
Researchers at the Astrological Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our, completed de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that the IAU estimates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such trip visits are is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-piece space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet interceptor) at a waiting position at 1.5 million kilometers away from Earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it will either wait for an unspoiled, fresh comet from our own solar system, or for an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, the new mega-port in the south of the Chinese capital has landed a China United Airlines first passenger engine, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers will be handled annually at the new airport, and by 2025, it will already be 72 million. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestige project is also called “Seasters” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways and runways to be expanded to seven later and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new metro transports passengers to Beijing city centre in just 20 minutes.
Even during construction, the Chinese had been told several times that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been in construction since 2006, has so far been postponed. On the other hand, a first passenger machine landed in Beijing after four years.
New supersonic aircraft is scheduled to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of making it possible for this, a special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire for the 2030s, the U.S. broadcaster CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely achieve this," said agency manager Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work more closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only oversonic aircraft for passenger transport so far, the Concorde had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 and took three to three and a half hours. In 2000 there was an accident at the start of a Concorde at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 passengers died. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft together with the US space authority Nasa, the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft could be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "next generation of truly reusable frame-driving devices".
Rebellion in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine
In Ukraine's business of possible abuse of power by the US President Donald Trump wants to track down possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday in front of employees of the United States Embassy at the United Nations in New York. The data subject was almost "a spy" and had been treated with this in the past "a little differently" than today.
This was regarded as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several US media, however, distributed audio recordings of the speech on Friday. Democrats responded outrageously to the President’s statement.
On Tuesday, the Democrats in the US House of Representatives announced preparations for the withdrawal of Trump. Their accusations are based above all on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who filed serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters. At great public pressure, the information provided by the adviser had been published on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, according to which the U.S. President uses "the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country intervenes in his favour of the US election in 2020.
At the heart of the accusations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues in office to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about past business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his shot from Ukrainian justice. Biden is ahead of the democratic presidential candidate for the election in 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House of being kept under the cover with a view to Ukraine's telephone service. Leading government staff would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic word protocol had been made. This had been removed from a commonly intended database after the conversation of lawyers from the White House and was stored instead in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the informant is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be a member of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had second-hand information that would have turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there might be no tipper or spy.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given Whistleblower information, however, aroused outrage. The chairman of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worriedly and complained, Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations have been taking place in various committees for months against Trump and its environment. In the light of Ukraine's allegations, the democrats are now pushing forward investigations with new strength to launch a possible withdrawal procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, accused him of misrepresentation of things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insulted the ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, who worked mostly among democratic, but also among Republican presidents, presented themselves in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation launched by the Democrats for a possible withdrawal procedure. If the allegations were true, if Trump's "unscrupulous abuse of power" would be said to have been the "unscrupulous abuse of power".
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, democrats could try out a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on an actual withdrawal was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects of success of such a procedure are low. So far no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Works Council: "sleaking" workplaces
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the motor manufacturer’s works council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros from ten billion euros to 2023. Of this, 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the works council in 2016 already provides for the destruction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. Basically, a job can only be dismantled by the car builder if it is proven that the associated activities are no longer necessary. Moreover, employment security will apply until 2029.
However, as our newspaper has now learned from operating councils, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are "slipping" over another path - that is, past the official course. Thus, becoming regular jobs would often not be replaced.
In these cases, the works council has no possibility of forcing the replacement. In the meantime, there are many staff who are lacking to increase the densification of work, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the car plants would increase. In order to increase the fear that vehicle production could gradually be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "An adjustment of the volume of employment takes place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This is also intended to reduce costs and also speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Head of Production Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "In uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves firm for crisis".
In this way there are already successes: for example, this year, production costs per vehicle would be reduced for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production time are not called VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around the Gulf 7 round.
20 hours.
In our region, the main plant Wolfsburg is the only VW plant in which vehicles are produced. The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the rule of thumb that 800,000 cars need to be built there every year to ensure that the plant is satisfactory. In 2018, however, the utilization in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles – due to the falling diesel demand and the problems of switching to the new consumption and exhaust gas testing procedure WLTP.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg "perspectively" should roll a million cars from the band. This should make it possible to combine the golf production in the main factory - because the Zwickau plant is refurbishing the golf production site by refurbishment to the e-car production site.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Gulf and Tiguan last declined. Therefore, the expectations now rest on the Gulf 8. Despite all efforts to build e-mobility, the Wolfsburger's bread and butter car should at first remain.
Forced by Voodoo to Prostitution: Trafficking in Human Beings
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution. Six suspected traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment on Friday in Bochum for up to eight years and three months. The accused had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced prostitution. In order to enforce their obedience, the exiled Nigerians still had to swear a ritual oath in front of a voodoo priest at home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean by Libyan locks in tugboats, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany they arrived, they were distributed across various brothels to work out the alleged lock costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the encroachment and the subsequent distribution of young Nigerians into brothels in the process. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult to do," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the hearing. "Some were rightly opposed."
The judgments are based on the occupational and interlocking of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, detention and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm's permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo Airmanship with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform the LH Group on 14 October about the work-fighting measures", said Ufo tariff manager Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct collective negotiations with Ufo for months. The question is also whether the union has legally terminated collective agreements with Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now sees itself strengthened following a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to see that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined to bring an appeal against it. "That a second court sees the matter quite differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo CEO Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed a request with the State Labour Court in Frankfurt to have the Ufo's status as a trade union reviewed. The company argued that the union had not set up a representative board for months and was therefore unable to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
Prior to this, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartenwerk, in which numerous members of the board of directors and the advisory board have resigned, including the long-standing trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. Due to the doubts about their leadership, the Ufo had suspended an initial vote on the strike of the cabin crew at Eurowings at the end of July.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is about to change. The country of the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and local visitors would increase to 100 million per year, the tourism commission announced.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a one-historic moment for our country," said Ahmad Al-Chatib, Chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the ore-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to Riyadh's own statement, it wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Abkaik and the oil field in Churais. In the follow-up, national oil production drastically broke down and oil prices rose. It is likely to take several weeks until the Kingdom’s oil production reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for the wedding feast
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time). Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles according to the People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi couple wants to marry church on the weekend.
The beebers gave themselves the Yes word a year ago in a New York State Office. There had not been a major festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead at plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed when a small aircraft crashed in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck had been discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), the police informed. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had sent an emergency signal via GPS. In the search, a military helicopter was also in use. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, alien species, unsustainable wood impact and the growth of cities are the causes of the threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species of trees known in Europe. 265 of these are not found in any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "dangerous", "highly endangered", "threatening from extinction" and "dead in nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as being endangered.
Eberesche and Wild Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats".
It also looks bad for the wild usually Rosskastania. Since 2017, it has been considered a "dangerous", level two of IUCN-scale. The biggest threat is the Balkans Miniermotte in addition to a mushroom. Since the 1980s it has spread from southeastern Europe all over the continent and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Rosskastania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 specimens. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and avenues.
Species of shrubs and mosses also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of the molluscs and mosses and almost half of all species of shrubs were threatened, according to IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of the wild, to dragged species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and being an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Agency. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 Reported Injured
At the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the reports, there were no dead people. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were thus damaged. Since the quake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks. On Thursday, the magnitude 5.8 of the earthquake had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now that the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, marking the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian Earth Plates.
One of the most severe quakes was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the mid-term show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. "It won’t be bigger," wrote Shakira to a photo of himself and Lopez. She was insanely excited to stand on the Super-Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be ready in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky during the mid-term show. "Now it is even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect to "show what we girls can do on the largest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honoured to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and all over the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "kingesses" were on stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against falling audiences
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most viewed TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped audiences, in this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the least viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still almost a hundred million people on average.
During the mid-term show of the last Super Bowl, there had been an uproar: According to media reports last February, Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the debate about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the reviews were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had been on his knees in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the national anthem from protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most afro-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unresponsive since March 2017 and has no longer fought an NFL party. He accuses the clubs of not wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are likely to face up to the plight of travel provider Thomas Cook, who is threatened with high write-downs on outstanding bonds and loans. Credit Suisse is also involved, writes the Financial Times in their Friday issue.
According to the report, banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to make total write-downs on their books of up to 1.8 billion pounds (about 2 billion euros), which would have been shown by the consulting firm AlixPartners.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase write-offs of between £900 million and £1 billion and the lenders between £550 and £825 million. The amounts actually charged would be more likely to lie at the upper end of the band, said an expert to the sheet.
How great the losses of the creditors will be in the end will be, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A person close to this procedure did not exaggerate too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK were "old" and many of the properties were in bad locations. Most of the money could probably be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't even have any secure information about it," said the spokesman of the Sea-Watch refugee organization, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators had been arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to Lampedusa Port, and in doing so, a ship of the Italian financial police, and that day the three suspects should have arrived there. The captain is facing investigations for aid to illegal immigration.
United States Warns Federal Government Against Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," said Pai to the "Handelsblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges each company "under Chinese law" to comply with instructions from the security agencies.
The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin wanted to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" under reference to its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," continues the FCC chief.
To China's Huawei Group, he announces close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The employee company, which allegedly belongs to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said the "Handelsblatt".
The US was informed that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to advertise the position of the US.
Chemiefabrik in Nordfrankreich burns: Schools closed
During the night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a north-French chemical factory. The fire has been wiped out after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the north-French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and kindergartens remain closed in the region.
The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not to put off the smoke. There were no injured ones. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their food and to stop the harvest for the first time.
The fire could be completely erased on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still a risk that the smell spread after the extinguishment, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes were in use.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported of huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol factory, which produced additional oil. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city centre.
The Normandy factory is part of the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In Italy, Seveso, Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river dams had been built against pollution, the prefecture stated.
The fire broke out at 2:40 in the early morning, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port town of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more in order to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany must invest and now, the sooner the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone was weak, warned the Minister.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions".
Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these margins, the Minister added and pointed to the high national debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. The French sovereign debt had to be "stabilised" and "reduced", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to address its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reliefs of more than €9 billion for households.
Among other things, the French government is responding to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates from question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capital Law" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law presupposes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics, however, fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician deviates from this option.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the law recently passed by Parliament, which should prevent this from happening. Johnson simply told journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the withdrawal date, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which complicates negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to postpone the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU's withdrawal. Johnson said he was striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is by agreement."
Johnson's chief consultant Dominic Cummings stated that he felt the political struggles for Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU exit was still achieved: "We will enjoy it, we will win, we will leave the EU, don't worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the 2016 election campaign before the EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK government seat Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister into an impeccable situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the picture "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroid Diaries is a fleeting glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for LindaMcCartney's legacy as engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Arizona until she found her photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s until the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekov Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is always at the heart of the matter: her husband Paul - how you may never have seen him.
As he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wears unshaped moonboats. Certainly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the spotlight on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a normal life. Thus Mary McCartney said according to BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had made from old potato boxes. And it was not always cleaned up at the McCartneys either.
Like hardly another medium, the polaroid camera captures the immediate moment. Linda McCartney’s recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about deciding click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to take it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you shoot two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in the Eshun essay.
There the light, the composition, the picture cut-out and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes already seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey intends to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems with the import of Iranian oil, as some companies had "retired due to the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran particularly on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The US has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the US, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear programme and is not complying with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and to a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
US government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The US government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. On Thursday, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling for a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which is equivalent to a 40 percent cut.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while the US would continue to see itself committed to supporting refugees, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system was overburdened.
In future, the US government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as indicated by the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be admitted from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected around the world and relocated in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the currently applicable ceiling of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85.000.
Aid organizations reacted horribly to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The US would continue to harm its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration into the US - legally and illegally - strictly. The US government expects 350,000 asylum applications according to its own data for the next financial year. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Drawing Close to a Spittle"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of spying. Whoever has scolded the informant who accused him of abuse of power, "comes close to a tip," said Trump according to a record of a private event in New York on Thursday. Several U.S. media report this in agreement.
According to this, Trump spoke to employees of the US UN Mission. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial transactions in the White House, he replied: "This is close to a tipping line". Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrayal, we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now".
The observers appreciated the latter remark on a possible appeal to the death penalty. The democrats strongly criticised Trump’s comments and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. Furthermore, it was an attempt to impede a congress investigation into a possible withdrawal procedure against him, the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory Committees in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower charges the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office in order to seek interference from another country in the US elections in 2020. In particular, it concerns his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation Trump advised him to launch investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump disputes any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower and its informants are. As the New York Times reports, however, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat known: Baby and toddlers drowning in Aegean
Time and again, people try to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats are often familiar with it. At the end of a tugboat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the end of a tugboat. Among the victims of the death were also a baby and four other children, reported the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men could then be rescued from the floods from the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouss in the northeast of Chios Island. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
There are currently hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancels Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has found a steady end because of the inconsistency of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. Daltrey told the audience in the eighth song, "I think I should leave it as long as it's still running".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added that Daltrey could not "really speak now". Townsend promised the audience that they would pay for it at a restitution concert. However, an appointment is not yet set.
On Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who announced that they would be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
All of a sudden, renting stopped: WeWork shakes real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has risen to become the largest office tenant.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from small startup to driving power on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had resigned founder Adam Neumann as head a few days ago, postponed the planned stock exchange process and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to gain financial room for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork, has stopped closing new rentals with immediate effect. This means, among other things, that in New York and London, the largest tenant of office spaces is suddenly reported from the market.
WeWork rents large office space in the long term and rents it in some small units to members in the short term. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning money at a breathtaking rate with this business. Last year, the company introduced a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with sales of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, rental costs are expected to have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars by renting new large areas. In order to limit the loss, the new management should now have pulled the emergency brake and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded leases with a maturity of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars result. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the world’s most expensive real estate markets, over the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWork’s new contracts made it possible that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the areas that have been new to the market at that time. Without WeWork’s expansion, the office teaching in the US metropolis would have increased at this time, as Alpert wrote in the “Business Insider”. Similarly, in London, WeWork is currently operating several dozen office locations in the best position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house bought in last year by Sparkasse Funder Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to write off some of the expected billions of income. Access to WeWork's reserves - anyway scarce - they do not have any reservations despite the long-term lease contracts. Because the rental of the individual WeWork locations is usually made by subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has only limited liability.
Russia again recorded numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, a total of 262 wilders who had fished illegally in the waters have been arrested, according to the Russian Homeland Secret Service FSB, informed the Interfax agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there had been no injuries, it was said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
Thus, the North Korean fishermen were on the move in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastguards are based on their own data on the protection of their marine biological resources patrols. During the re-inspections, 30,000 intensified fish were discovered. In addition, the data from three fishing and two motorboats were confiscated and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Nowosti, the coastguard in 2018 recorded a total of more than 8,000 infractions.
Even after complaints from local entrepreneurs, the Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high ecological damage caused by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with tight synthetic nets banned in Russia. With them also small creatures would be taken out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard had been injured in the last week’s arrests. According to a wounded North Korean, the FSB later died of his injuries. On that 17th September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second one after it had opened fire.
US ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The US has imposed bans on the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs justified this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations". As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he has a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily arrested and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, the brother of the dead leader of the revolution Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there by the support of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," pointed out American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had banned entry on Wednesday, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, there has been a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him to kneel and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The Socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the repression of government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again planning actions and demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the shift in time, New Zealand and Australia are expected to begin before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major demonstration in Montreal, Canada.
How big the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "Last Friday has worked over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany, last Friday’s attendance was very large. A good third of all worldwide protesters – around 1.4 million – had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to Fridays for Future. According to a list of the movement, rallying was planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the road for climate change.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had stood before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to ask the politicians of her country for a stronger commitment to climate protection. Within a short period of time, the Fridays-for-Future movement emerged. Students and students are involved in the climate protests, but increasingly scientists and other adults are involved.
Together they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disaster. In particular, the Paris climate agreement required that global warming be curbed to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison with pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York about a month ago after a two-week Transatlantic Tour with a high-sea racing yacht. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday she gave an emotional speech to the UN, in which she spoke in an intrusive way to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home Stockholm on Wednesday, she was awarded the Nobel Alternative Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation for her commitment to climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow, according to Tass agency. The ban is due to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes anyway has to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette is to ignite a fire, the penalty will be higher. According to the Ministry, it is also allowed to burn candles. Also meat squirts on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Fighting Cybercriminals - Investigators Eliminate Servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal transactions in the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as an operator of a data centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through the internationally operating criminals.
This was announced by the General Public Prosecutor's Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening during a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects are said to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had destroyed investigators in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million Telekom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in the Cyberbunker, according to the State Attorney General.
Such a hoster had been expelled in Germany for the first time, it was said. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
The access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9 has included searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It has been the result of nearly five years of investigations. In the afternoon the investigators want to inform us about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement again planned actions and rallying in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major conference in Montreal, Canada.
Climate Protests (2010) Who are Thunberg's hindmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. All the more amazing is that a 16-year-old girl keeps the power man in front of his nose at that time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing a climate activist? Historical mastery or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and moves young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. Historically, it is not the first time in Europe that a young person manages to gain a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt chosen to work for a more just world. At that time, he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself and this convinces him to cross the sea to get to the Promised Land, just like Greta Thunberg has recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this? Why does it take a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far enough, thanks to the daughter in the spotlight. Also, old proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into effect in the media around the world and there is a lot of money flowing thanks to the impressive action.
Is it still authentic if certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the World Salvation Action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratically shaped society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question seemingly devout projects by certain trend-setters critically.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star crossed through our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on Crimea. He looked at the sky with a self-built telescope and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind that was sighted during transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to catch insights into a strange solar system from the vicinity. Apparently the comet resembles that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), the comet is clearly interstellar and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola railway that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in detail. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted in his approach, which means that he can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium sized telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US space agency Nasa. "After that it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights into comet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it, the spectrum of the tail is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in ours, added de León’s colleague Javier Licandro.
However, observation goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Again and again, asteroids employ the researchers. Only recently did a giant asteroid rush past the earth and come close to it dangerously.
"Absolutely repugnant": Rachel Johnson horrified about brother
To Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, is biting the prime minister's war language as "flavorless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Fraud", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip himself - at least verbally. During the question hour in the House of Commons this Wednesday, this encountered massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have spoken: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News, her brother, to use words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU withdrawal were to be "hanged, dragged, quadrupled, whipped and feathered." She thought this was extremely reprehensible. She did not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnson, who had entered the EU Parliament elections for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
Her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly House Member, who had been murdered by a Neonazi a few days before the 2016 retirement referendum, said Boris Johnson in the House of Commons. "It is very unsavory to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," he criticized Johnson's sister. The perpetrator had obviously come from the right-wing extreme camp, who felt "enforced by this kind of language". For all those who mourned about her, it was very untapped.
The widow of Cox also strongly criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is to enter passionately and decisively for what you believe - no matter what you think you are. But never should you "damon the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen that attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson’s younger brother Jo had resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory’s member. “I have been torn between loyalty to family and national interest in recent months – it is an insoluble tension,” Jo Johnson explained the step.
Johnson's language was also critical of the Church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is a strong sign: in the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women perform with Latino roots, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming final of the US Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira announced in a video.
The final of the American football league, which will celebrate its 100th birthday next year, will be held in Miami on February 2. Many people live in the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is shown in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. In 2001, she made her worldwide breakthrough with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected with excitement in the United States every time. This year, many are also considered to be a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a giant advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused terror there. Usually, NFL finals watch well over 100 million television viewers, it is now also very popular in Germany.
Last year political controversy arose in advance. The reason was the dispute over the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up against police force against blacks when playing the national anthem and had been hard hit by U.S. President Donald Trump, among other things. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance – including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the rock group Maroon 5 appeared was ultimately criticised by many.
An actor and Youtuber joins Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for the first time.
The two men who have an influence on the flow of blood on the streets of Egypt have both spent the past week abroad. One of them once again floated into Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The ex-general, who in 2013 resigned Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had Sisi taken action against political Islam and lost no silver on the human rights violations at the Nile - in a week when Egypt’s security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the president. He had “no reason to worry,” said Sisi at the airport in the microphones of state television. “The Egyptians are not allowed to go astray”.
Leading astray - according to the president of the other man, who is currently deciding what happened on the streets. Mohamed Ali of course remained abroad, where he withdraws the access of the security forces who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Before weeks ago, the 45-year-old as an actor was known only to a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tone-giving voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafes, the living rooms and tearooms of the country: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise up against Sissi.
He approaches the head of state directly and in quite a rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is in luxury and let himself build magnificent new palaces, it says. The army leadership, based on Sisi’s rule, rejects Ali corruption and enrichment. Because he spent 15 years in his second job as a construction contractor with exactly these gentlemen, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the click figures show just too exploding.
After the last week that Sisi had been arrested for the first time since the arrest of thousands of people, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would venture on the streets. But there were isolated minor protests, for example in Giseh near Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants accused Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his resignation. During these protests, the police also used tear gas and rubber bullets. These videos were not independently verified. From security circles, it was said that the police ended the protests.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where protesters broke banners last week with the portrait of the president, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the downhill streets. In Cairo several metro stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance work", most streets around the Tari Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, on which in 2013, supporters of the overthrown Muslim brother Mursi hid until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, should prevent another measure from gathering dissatisfied: Sisi's future party wanted to hold a major rally for the president here.
Mohamed Ali caused these precautions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a retreater, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not have to blindly trust the provider’s speed specification. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of a problem.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a contractual element and should therefore also be achieved, says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various testing possibilities. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the agreed rate in the contract.
"However, the tests of suppliers are carried out according to supplier-specific requirements and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the Consumer Centre of Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised service. This is best done in writing by registered registration.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also claim damages. However, if there is no success, only the path of action will help.
First senior Republican for investigation
As the first senior Republican, the Governor of Vermont has voted for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it leads from here, the facts are determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower business before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the resignation of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic presidential candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump observed Biden "for years."
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort. Scott’s comments are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, for example against the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland’s Spider-Man would no longer be part of the “Avengers” universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is what several US media report in agreement. This is why the movie should also be recorded: In the USA, the film should start from July 16, 2021.
Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted in the magazine "Screenrant": "I'm glad that Spidery's way continues in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to compete in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidery verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it get to the sudden good news? It is said that Sony Marvel has offered an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which includes Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of emerging Spider-Man films. However, the news is not confirmed.
That's how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now arrived at the big final. In the last episode, there have been many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, has been garnered in a charming way. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series final.
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a last farewell greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospects showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and the successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his sentence of imprisonment.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finale incidentally, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) walks straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a significant remark about his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a skirt, the suspect Harvey wants to know about the bridegroom, only to be cleverly noted: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Aegean: Baby and four more children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in the cellar of a refugee boat in the Aegean. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousse, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he would like to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the relevant EU Commissioner, he wanted to "inform himself in Turkey about the situation of refugees", said Seehofer on Friday. He wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of Greeks" in Athens in order to help in dealing with them.
On Friday, a spokesperson of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for the Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey still arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increased figures recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement signed in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who illegally cross Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each displaced Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only arduous on the Greek side because of lack of staff. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29,400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrants are currently accommodated in a storage facility with a capacity of 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 have there been so many, reported the Staatsrundfunk.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system over the next 20 to 50 years," said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the cardiovascular system created high temperatures and high temperature rises within a short period of time and led to heart attacks. People with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics were particularly affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for embarrassing photopanny.
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained undetected for quite a long time - and finally noticed. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand the reusable coffee cup with metal straw. On the party’s website she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also distributed to the media - and there was the cup still a snowy (pop) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chief must be responsible for photopanny
The National Post subsequently launched May's manipulation and that the Fake News Party produces news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection". And that in the middle of an electoral campaign on the Lower House elections, in which Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and debated fake news. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cups."
May appeared shocked and claimed on her blog that she didn’t know anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, held a cup in her hand. However, the one who put it right was from bamboo. She always had it with him. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was just about putting the party logo in the picture, and not hiding something. From the photo on the website only a cut-off is to be seen.
May writes, it hurts her for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something from her overcommitted team: "If they want to edit a picture again, could they not do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also come across because of their use of disposable plastic or because of flights in Shitstorms - their pictures were, however, not photoshopped. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was granted an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked to check in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneous get an upgrade for the Business Class - many of them dream of having passengers. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in staff offer a free change from the Economy Class.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-explained influencer actively asked the airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng will follow more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the way out, employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline even though she had presented an email that allegedly provided her Cathay Pacific with an upgrade. Writing wants to have received the influencer from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, accuses Jaqueline of having forged the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman should have presented the same mail, but with a different reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they were hunting at the headquarters. In fact, the employee from whom the mail was supposed to come should have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not show up.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about $1,280), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocate, a company representing consumer interests. Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the e-mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline’s terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices, according to the Yemen Armistice Report
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollar - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American type West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
The trigger for the tour was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought about five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huti rebels allied with Iran in the civil war country Yemen had filed a complaint about the attacks. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would dampen the political tension in the region.
Should an agreement actually come about, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Raw Materials Strategy Department at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement over the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Recently Bloomberg had reported on insider that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia progressed faster than thought after the attack in mid-September. Thus, the production volume had again reached an eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases calling for insiders to report on rapid progress made by the state oil group Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to avoid a stock exchange and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to exit the port. The crew was now preparing the departure while the ship was still anchored, shipowner Erik Hånell informed Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the U.S. announced that its defence missiles and soldiers would be relocated to Saudi Arabia to the Iranian archenemy. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily brought oil prices up sharply in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, accusations of protection against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials would have made an intense effort to prevent access to the wording of the conversation at the end of July after a disputed phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. That explained an anonymous adviser. The spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, the democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "disgusting". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that it will soon reach a third summit of power commander Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The sense and the prospects of success of such a meeting were questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday according to the KCNA agency.
The US had done nothing to implement the summit decisions in the previous year, said the adviser of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized intensified US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the US and South Korea. However, he hopes for a "wise" and "mute" decision of Trump to bring it closer.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring before he was prepared to do so. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been going on since the failure of Trump and Kim’s second summit in Hanoi in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitary zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revive the talks, but to date without great success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
With a blue splitter vest, British Prince Harry symbolically lit and destroyed a bombardment in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place of Dirico, he created the ignition circuit. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola out of the mine by 2025, he later called in front of current TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who have not helped to get out of the way."
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In view of a rapid fall in interest rates, the pound will lose value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on an early interest rate reduction by the Bank of England (BoE) increase the Pound Sterling. On Friday, the UK currency was fined up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars.
The sales were triggered by statements made by the banker Michael Saunders. This led to a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be averted, as the uncertainty would affect the British economy for an foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was the champion of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by Brexit hack without directly signaling a fall in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would like to lead his country out of the EU, if necessary, without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk. However, it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Danish Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the Light Athletics World Association.
New details about the Doping scandal in Russia appear at the start of the World Athletics World Cup - and they destroy the small amount of credibility that the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and only in an initial way. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidope Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sport. The Wada had shut down the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banished from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual testing at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, entered about 270 athletes in the country under neutral flag, and in the winter games in February 2018 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to participate in the World Cups in the various sports, and even the football World Cups in Russia took place in the summer with the host.
Missing positive findings
In the following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada banner again, but demanded access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases at the State Doping. They should help punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Commission on Integrity (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory were manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Newspaper" of Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower and those that it received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association holds as its only organisation at Russia’s banner. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they are training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week the Wada manipulations had already put in the room and asked Russia to respond to the accusations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new block of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
