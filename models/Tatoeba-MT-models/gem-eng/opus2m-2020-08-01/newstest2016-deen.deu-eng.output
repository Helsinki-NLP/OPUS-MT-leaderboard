Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and condemns Netanyahu's unwillingness in the peace process.
Because of the deal advertised by Obama about the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between the two continued to deteriorate.
In March Netanyahu made a controversial speech at the Republicans' invitation to the U.S. Congress, which in part was regarded as an affront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, and a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election that was to come in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a rather shivering voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was scribbled on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.
There was another death until the end of the day: Lamb took his life when the police chained him up.
One day after the shooting in the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees knew him, helped to draw an image of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching body includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies toward problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said that he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something were wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the University's employment policy meant that the doctorate, for whom the Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic path to an Assistant Professorship.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends called him intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and lamb was 20 when they met with common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
At the time, he was the lady's warm.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played one gig or another together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony game in front of a few audiences.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening, about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Lessons will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentisss called his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to cut down on Christmastime workers
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it is planning to recruit 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country. During the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will start application discussions this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes gradually clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "undisputedly the biggest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - at the margins of the Ministerial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in the crisis in Syria that they demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveys that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have taken him for a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull down Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls, it has (still) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit area, and some start to seriously question what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain, none of whom won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll of the Monmouth University revealed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers stay in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "enraged" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "enraged" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of the Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temper doesn't fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly hats, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
When asked who wins the GOP nomination the most, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet after a survey of CNN/ORC last week.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
But a poll of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A close majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have formed their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change his mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violents" two months ago, immigration was a turning point in public discourse for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it too.
Frustration on the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in ABC/Post's new Monday survey, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington, too.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "hately annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here on the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a Reed roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited", says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows where special layers cost one square metre the most.
Of course, 18,70 Euros per square metre for a student shop in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential areas, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, well noted.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the forefront here, by the way.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double scorer in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy match from Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a earned 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Witch boiler of Piraeus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their first match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hits (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th start-up success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final in Italy on May 28, 2016, where Guardiola finally wants to get the handle pot to Munich in the third start-up.
Müller received the help of Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto in his 28th match at the Champions League for Bayern Leadership, who made one of the world champion's flanked shots happen.
"We will not underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before playing in Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea, without shining.
Piraeus had won his latest six home games in the king class, among them against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bavaria, in seven European Cup duels undefeated with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously approached, but often too ingeniously, in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting to Douglas Costa's left side, which rarely struck the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank from the right half fell into the upper left.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possible 2:0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in half.
First, when Olympiakos stormer Ideye Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26.).
Then by direct debit, the Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayern used to put on her dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needlesticks.
However, Manuel Neuer was abandoned.
For instance, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56.).
Prior to Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain defender with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the cadre, first sat outside.
After the final training, the World Cup hero gave the green light, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else about it, that's already malicious".
During the first shift, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the defeated Lewandowski (59).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and finished everything 13 minutes later, Muller put another on it by 11 meters.
Before the game it had come to Krawallen in the stadium.
After a small group of partly disguised Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts of Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and acted with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported out of the stadium.
Those who smoke have a higher risk of losing their teeth
Anyone who smokes does not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdamer long-term study.
The good news: In case of renunciation, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This results from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of premature loss of teeth was higher for the 2.5 to 3.6 compartment.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The DifE emphasizes that the main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the gum.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the gums in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking, however, could reduce their risk within a short time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years for the threat to go back to the level of non-smokers, explained First Author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
One had to convince people to become non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing of the DifE: "Smoking shortens the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health up to the old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, DifE announced.
Previous investigations have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains of late antiquity at Cologne’s Rheinifer
Archaeological findings have been made on the right Rhine in Cologne for a number of times.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanian Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum will always be added as a department for archaeological ground memorial care.
In the third building phase of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It had already been known from text documents that in the place of the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood, said Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves had also been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman covered by freight train
After a young woman's accident at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police ask the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the railway station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Bundespolizei, she has suffered serious injuries from the operation of the train.
She was treated as an emergency doctor on site and brought to a hospital by rescue workers.
There is no knowledge of the cause of the night crossing of the young woman's tracks to the investigators.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
There are residents or passers-bys of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be given under the free hotline of the Federal Police at 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to resolve the dispute over the planned TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private conciliation bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system which, in its functioning, corresponds significantly more to traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the performance.
The Swedish are planning to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU Member States and the US to select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are to come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time there is also a second instance.
It would allow an objection to be raised against judgments.
Up to now, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long term, according to its own information, it intends to work towards an International Investment Court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The Investor State Arbitration Procedures (ISDS) required mainly by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, by which companies claim damages to taxpayers, by legislating national laws or by enforcing a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact identified the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, called the plans great progress.
The Commission considered key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel had drawn up in spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitrators is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting business appeals by too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises could be particularly disadvantaged by this, it was said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should already be in place at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be non-sustainable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pin.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Steven's lecture.
He tells on the basis of various places that he records repeatedly on the map, about which his minute and delicately arranged songs report.
Where they were created and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear, which harmoniously blend very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
The rumor arises that "Michigan" would be the first part of a disproved series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in a row.
But already in 2004 and near Rhein has already appeared "Seven Swans" and is breaking positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens acts here.
Live enough guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoisis") a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece was published in 2005.
Abounding in ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any year's best list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offsets.
This sixth neat studio album is still widely orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
Long as the smaller clubs got out, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of Neon-Bands and a large fluorescent stage decoration.
Sufjan Stevens is currently on tour as part of a five-member band through Germany.
More in the dark Hamburger!
He will mainly present the "Carrie & Lowell" which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now exiled in their chairs, Stevens, who has become more mature, returns to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide-ranged album.
From the audience one hears: The talk was "opulent" and you could thus "strip away the plate in essence".
Only to an addition does Stevens modestly thank, plays acoustically few older songs and finally bows down to a loud applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is eagerly expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and to join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six pre-set questions shortly after noon, examining his performance by the media probably and the Labour Members from the vicinity.
He demanded "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, for after his appointment she will be a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the Labour Chairman's decision to stand still on Tuesday during the National Anthem's singing at a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and is the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
A speaker from Mr Corbyn said that he had "standed in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldenity of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC’s political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn’s comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour is submitting changes to remove the whole idea of a limit in total.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pension Ministers, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman, who has been facing David Cameron since he was Tory-Chief over the dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "slapsiness" and quarreling with renegade and has instead undertaken to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Minister for Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues sometimes took the floor and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle-Theater", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's question time. But a few years later, he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.
'Shoots in Joburg': Obsessive young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds are rising by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the net profit in the UK grew by 2.9% over the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and made estimates of the date of an increase in interest rates since 2009.
The pound rose by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1,5505 and was climbed to 0.84% compared to the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover bid of Rivalen AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are once again reporting growth.
Glencore's shares increased by 5% after the mining giant said he had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment for the company rating on "selling".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages are at risk of expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labour costs of its company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lipped 21 years young, a prisoner with a superchip freshness.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than that.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m. in the morning, however, the pole sits on the cold stone plates form Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose posters hang in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs just as much as her mama Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Victoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'll make her a dream."
School duty?
Who's jogging?
The fans don't.
Not even beeber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For the advertising break of the Superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-picle company flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like it and goes over the barn table, Bieber also cashes.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you'll be amazed at the window disk.
More than 100 million he should have been so exploited.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros.
At least he does.
Pegida-Placate brings Lebanese to potato-fielder-Idee
Potatoes or donners?
Both things are going on - in the potato-field toner developed by Oldenburger Imbishowner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "Cartoff instead of Donner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spear.
He was introduced to the idea by a poster on a pegida demonstration with the inscription "Kartoffeln instead of Donner", which he had happened to see on television.
Since then, in his shop there is a grilled skewer, which is filled with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculture for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
So Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the spear contains.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary understanding of the people is also well received by its customers.
Metcash launches Soil Permanence Campaign to Combat Aldi Invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA facilities from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesalers Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distribute samples in IGA shops and shop owners selling the cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29th when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA cargo stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of their first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries and will take away all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million of revenues per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash lost market shares in the East, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash's board contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction at the same time as pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler is fighting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week and IGA retailers to improve their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods.
Metcash's chief manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and retail refurbishment programmes will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism of his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is often referred to as "Special Ks", fell into the spotlight at the Montreal Masters due to the infamous conflict of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, and Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a seizure destroyed a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in detail behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty mature about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been a little involved in the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a bat when he lost a seizure in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a fighter out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too hard.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is training hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term fixed component."
"First we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick managed to get up very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the spotlight in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and closed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held fast all those who tried to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man country and Serbian officials responded with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck in the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown time, and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "opened the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrived.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There will have to be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border did not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation block in a disputed meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, finally, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency situation on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said in the meantime that his country also planned to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after ending a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant gateway and an entry point to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4-meter (13 feet) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher penalties for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," said government spokesperson Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree with the military's deployment, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Consultant for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country deeper.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pushed a crowd to penetrate there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's head start in front of Bernie Sanders halved in national survey
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her face-to-face.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-election elections (58 percent before), while Sanders stands second, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, is receiving support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some profits.
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moderates, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has fled, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a great advantage among the older voters.
Last month Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
Around half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections state that they would be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if it were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastically supporting it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections say that they are enthusiastically supporting Clinton, less republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman becomes president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent on dealing with the problems and choice are also quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the Presidential Office into the scales, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
If democratic voters of the pre-elections are asked who would be their second vote for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
More than half of Clinton's followers say that Biden would be their second choice far in front of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election, but this figure of 78 percent has fallen last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most elective" has increased.
Nevertheless, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters raise questions about the eligibility of candidates.
As in last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the pre-elections emerges as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results with some important features in voters of their party's pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden best cuts off the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leader.
Thirty percent of democratic voters don't believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think so.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, most democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this matter was split in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had deteriorated.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of ten, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded by the voters of its party as honest and trustworthy, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters don't think they're an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters throughout the country also regard Trump as dishonest and unreliable.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are the best candidates for honesty.
A majority think of Sanders as being more honest, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion of him.
The error rate for the 351 Democratic voters sample in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson moves up close to Donald Trump in a nationwide survey
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times survey
The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically in support of the new survey.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide. Support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot in the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also revealed that Carson arrived well in demographic groups and surpassed Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he is landing behind the Trump with 32% support at 19%.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
In view of a carson that rose last week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees hot.
Even if peaks are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathers to find warm water.
A bathroom in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: Maximum 18 degrees of water in the North and Baltic Seas this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: In the east it even reaches 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood burdened with the death of a Baruch College newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a schikanous ritual of a student relationship in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murders are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an inaugural ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he was trying to reach a goal through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide utensilien and basically placed the well-being of the brotherhood on Michael Deng's," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with blunt force injuries to the head, buttocks and thighs.
"Too many families were destroyed by the harassment of the brotherhood. At least one student has died every year from the harassment since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an accusation of third degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to make the persons involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also take these to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house is going to collapse, yields for bonds are going to rise, and the economy is going to slip into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start increasing interest rates, but rather on the period required for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical look at how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to squander property income 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the path to interest rate increase, rather flat in the 250 days thereafter (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, head of investment strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that it did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
It is quite remarkable that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the event of an increase in the Fed's interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, only two times the nominal GDP of 118 interest increases since 1950 was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken on an increase in interest rates throughout the year, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading only represents a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all the cycles of increase from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing fluctuations in GDP and have been shattered very quickly after the beginning of recovery," the report says.
In contrast, this is a distinctly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far it is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds moving closer and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flatter, loan margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that carry out the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from rising interest rates and increasing the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational high-debt companies will be worse off, as rising dollar costs their products on the global market as well as financing their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock markets, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
savers could see profits through higher profits, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for his "dump"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The British
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he is doing something that the private transmitters are not doing.
Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public radio station was "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dump" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The British just under a different name.
So, if you're trying to do something else -- these are two spontaneous examples where you're actually just imitating what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and commissioning new works, I think it's really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that hard work had to be done to involve the audience more than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, was under fire to kick the commercial rivals' feet.
The Tory MEP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media at an estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "on special BBC-wise".
He added that he wanted the company to "find a hit from our own stable" when it started a series of entertainment next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet revenues rose the slowest in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was a 7 percent increase in online sales.
Last month, there has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday slowed down spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online revenues stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, e.g. at home on the sofa.
But now this is commuting, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bargains, and some dealer websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargains, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending a little more than £1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in a crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia is loading the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-laden group in part
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into Mecca's Great Mosque.
Mourning ones, largely dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-Friedhof.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the beggars.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 betters killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadjsh after Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the bin-laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the State Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Laden Group is responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company's travel abroad is prohibited.
At the beginning of this week Salman praised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsch, which takes place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of the Krans, and their representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also denounced the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surrounded by Mecca's Great Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia family of rulers for decades and is taking over major construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was evicted by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£174,000) be paid to the members of the killed and that the same sum be permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employment is increasing, says Veronique Lauri
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has risen behind it
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lower their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out the work at their home
If you can handle a hammer or a brush to strike walls, you seem to be a minority these days.
For Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out heimwerker jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Lauri, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe who have now been offering services at low prices has been overtaken.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are aimed at craftsmen and to close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Lauri said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the men are overwhelming.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Lauri said, "It's still working a majority of men in our branches.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of decisions about the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Lauri, who is one of only five women at the head of a British company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial director.
Mrs. Lauri said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profits and sales after the group trained the costs of closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to answer for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants didn't confess.
One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been replaced.
According to U.S. Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it had crystallized that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was removed by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
As a result of the infidelity, the defense stated that the association had at no time suffered an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials would only have billed expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to some 600,000 shillings in 2001 (r. 44,000 euros).
"At that time we faced the situation: Are we going to continue the club or shut it down?" said one of the defendants, in the bread trade major auditors of the Treasury.
He then decided, with his colleague and fellow defendant, to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have pre-loaded money, placed our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at the conclusion.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, only no debts can be made.
In addition, the payment of the compensation had been decided retrospectively by 1991, in the event of financial success.
As a result, part of the compensation was paid only years later, i.e. from the year 2003, when an increase had been paid in the account.
Therefore, even flat-rate and not detailed bookings appeared, the former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association did not have a detailed interest in the financial situation, so the answer was that only debt freedom was important.
When in 2011 the one official investigation started due to abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club account.
Those had been reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
"Why?", the judge wanted to know.
For a long time the respondent did not know any answer to that.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "damage recovery".
Why damages?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree to this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "You're all out of the tailor with that."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never earned a cent, he only charged kilometers of money and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years were not available to the defendants.
They stated that they had not been kept after an in-service examination, in which everything had been judged to be correct.
Kilometer money had also been taken from the second defendant.
All the corrections had been made in cash, so he had to go from his residence to the bank to Bleidurg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard reaches another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the staff cut that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut down further jobs when the company is split up.
The job strike at the US computer Hewlett-Packard (HP) will not end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. Technology Group is planning to cut from 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
In order to save costs of USD 2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step would lead to a special burden of around $2.7 billion, which would be imposed from the fourth quarter.
The ongoing reduction of 55,000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP employed some 302,000 employees.
After reading, the Hewlett-Packard share gave up 2.3 percent.
The large group of printers from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: this is how the computer and printing business should be concentrated even more this year in a new society - separated from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A again disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for their services have recently increased the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter to the end of July, sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.4 billion dollars.
This led to a decrease in revenues in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job deletions.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers are strengthening smartphones and tablets instead of buying conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide for a total of about 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting acts in Iraq would be a major obstacle: 54 per cent, on the other hand, voted against, 35 per cent voted in favour.
The fact that other states are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervention in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on networked, self-driving cars and electric mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "Mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday on.
The organisers of the VDA Auto-Verband expect about 900 000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: outbreak of violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police deployed tear gas and waterthrowers on the Serbian border against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it a police line had formed and behind the police there was a water thrower ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used continuous pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while ago.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees sank together and suffered from respiratory distress.
The press spokesmen of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
The world is watching when the US bank of notes meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found out that a little more than half who was still thinking last week that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and that the interest rates will keep at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years since Fed's interest rates were set on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a slight inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is due to be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday
Death protectors at Delta State University left a letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his co-workers on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unseemly," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency call number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
and said he shot at someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45 who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "damaged to the ground".
He said Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He's not going to jail."
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
In the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University, as his lifeline on the University's website states.
Stars that have lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also allegedly had to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug possession.
I'm sure all this calls for his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is rebuilding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.
150 of the world's around 1000 managers will cost the company the job.
However, the pilots' union has new negotiations.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and upgrading the Eurowings' cheap daughter.
The objective of the realignment was to make a profit contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board team headed by Carsten Spohr.
With the refurbishment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to take action against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the case of collective bargaining with the VC, negotiations will be resumed on Thursday after the court-stopping strike.
The union told me that.
The subject of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible "in a year with a forecasted record result".
The conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is the "Wings" austerity concept in addition to the transition of the pilots.
It foresees that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the Eurowings Group's low-cost line in the fight against competitors.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left defender cry and will exclude him from the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He is transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 and it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he had on an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an 11 meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had erred.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11 meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."
Based on this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of PSV
With the European Championship in France, the UK defender has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Coco.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, the environmental fab of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971, decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because there seems to always be an image or a message that we have missed so far."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book, instead reproduces a table of contents of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amid the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey to the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. One of the interests of love was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but was completely unknown.
As if this were not yet suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins as follows: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the work of the book. Here hears an unnamed boy, as the local environment is destroyed by the money-loving, tree-causing, thneeded knitting Once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a scorning, snorting being, "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who The Lorax did not read a child 20 times in a row.
A downing street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard.
To run into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the cadre that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an exodus.
Alastair Cook's site may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear any 2012 scars, only a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth resigns from the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best pickers.
Long ago they would have extended the course of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he makes further runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The English coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that does not surprise me; he is primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test hit man gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in supreme form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man I really appreciate.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat up next to Cook, what an extra-spin-bowler would do and get four quicks showed up, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a hitman can't hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be a devil's man by Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs right away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up spider, and in my limited way with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are no large numbers of backup spiders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some smart additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as adviser for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played against all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I have always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin, even if the news is in line with the previously said one.
Colly's teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team designers do not set the timetable.
And you have to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easily.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy flares up by 2017
David Cameron's undefended renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to be in more trouble every day, even without the choice of genius Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is fighting fiercely for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Colors.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always on its own account, are tired of Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive Treaty changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like to do so if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes a UK looking outside inside the EU tent - "Let's not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as happened with the excessive endurance like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan unhelpful remarks, quite in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a mess" and "Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU sceptic is the oligarchy of the Press Barones, as it was during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, who supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro-opportunist, who made a name as an "EU-straight-banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing villains, telephone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's swirl of referendum, for Blair had put forward the principle of the EU's non-adopted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never forgave him either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-colored trend and the wilder fields of Tory's small-englanderism can probably say yes to that.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and on television this week when the Scout fought in him, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father on television tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellows and MPs after all the reports at her clause meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of television around the clock and above all in the structure of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to consider Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a self-evidentness, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their narrow siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC does not start a campaign to quit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - in order to make concessions to the British, if all of this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I started on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking were made from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principal Report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called up to develop a multi-criteria analysis (Multi-criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to produce a synthesis of their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting stated that they would receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International in advance, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE tobacco management.
The group's research work "significantly acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there was no evidence so far that e-cigarettes were premature as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers".
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been answered before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related illness, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in strongly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and of broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast, which would also clearly be shown by non-subsidized rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communication Committee as part of his research into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least place your production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course it's nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax programme could be financed, even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what former director of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite, but they do their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put it in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Regarding the broadcasting fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system with regard to conditions that can get the best out of it.
Of course, you all think we all think that you get a big value for 150 pounds a year here, but for people who are for 150 pounds a lot of money, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also said before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review their Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain."
He said that little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and she should take an example of this in "informing, enlightening and entertaining" at the public television channels in Australia and Canada.
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the proms, of which he said that only a handful is shown on television, and enter with the commercial channels alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
Further information on this topic: Read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Srikanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Wire worms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplified the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such as a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
If it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblowers and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with Opgogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn neurons on and off with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can occur freely and can be sent into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the target human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

The ads shame Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Show Video.
Horrible killer drones!
Leg shattering leg restraints!
Pantomime!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British government's willingness to dispel arms to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters, which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from 15th to 18th September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR... customers are asked to help at the stop of the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, claiming that "access to around one third of bus stop advertising areas on the planet is achieved."
Transport for London does not find this posterism "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-weapon stores greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic, ambiguous advertising of companies, but "by bluishing with bright colors and animation it remains more attached."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a step in the way of the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be acted illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors store fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the US Army on "the AT4CS RS shot off the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped head of battle, which provides outstanding aftereffect effects within the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still in the belief in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve- exciting to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to whisper: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honourfully don't love Marmite or hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers.
Leave people alone.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, film night venues and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and dress up their underwear.
Regarding this: Don't think about starting at the university with a relationship
Introverts receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space-bomb culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy that I have used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a companion of socialism is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
Since you start university at the height of the back mania, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat make people sleep when you knock.
To steal food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the chewing of chickens is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about being one of the people who sit in the glass house in the truest sense of the saying.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if it would matter to them to put Drum & Bass a little bit quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had her own music plastered, closed her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student home?
On the other hand, would it not be profoundly embarrassing if you considered a roommate for your future wife, approached her, divorced again, and then had to see her every day, and perhaps experience how all her common friends are moving over to themselves?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk a little sense into your abdomen.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his unclosed room, the border between an elk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never waste anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and place your keys in a glass of water, which will then put you in the freezer - but thank you for your belongings on the ceiling no more than twice.
Holiday homes for refugees, single parents, low-wage earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds row houses for people who don't have much money in the central Franconian corner valley.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only do refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the lowly earner."
"I show you how to build cheaply and well today," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how to create cheap housing quickly: he builds row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient housing in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-storey house is the solution.
Gildner: A house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in living blocks.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How much are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have successfully completed my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulations.
Horrible.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities lacks space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we had a tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built, which can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent mother or the low-wage earner.
I'll show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially studied environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some encountered problems after installation, as they received an error message that announced that the "software update has failed".
To avoid the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or try to update over iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made it more unlikely by slimming the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a cancellation of the update.

You should also make sure that before your download you have looked through our checklist of all things to prevent things from going wrong and protecting yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity feature for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg, in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, knows only one motto: "Full Attack".
Before the start of the World Cup, the two countries stressed in the crucial seven overseas races that "I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore from the title defender and double champion Hamilton on this Sunday.
The British have already won seven of the previous twelve season races and have also launched the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an impact on Singapore's Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days a dune bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed for the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the first class and honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by the chairman Alfred Klein.
It is therefore possible to include chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent searching should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quarterly office looking for direct contact
Saludis and Antonistift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically, to the Graf Stauffenberg Square.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will now receive seniors and consulting information on issues such as care insurance or health insurance services.
For years we have found with our outpatient care that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Even many of the cashier's services are not rarely used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antoni Foundation and the Citizens' Hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care Centre", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is that both managing directors are particularly affected by demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the Quartiersbüro also dedicated itself to the association at an age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite them to a regular social gathering".
This makes the social foundation a major contribution to making it possible for older people to live as independently and as well as possible in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9am to 14pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 16am to 6pm and Saturdays from 10am to 12pm.
Eintracht Bamberg v. Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the appointment for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party player Würzburger Kickers had not yet been fixed due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the 6th of October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian football Totopokal against the third-party FC Würzburger Kicker was now finalized.
It will be played at the Fuchsparkstadion in Bamberger on Tuesday, 6 October at 19:00.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going over stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched pre-sale of cards.
It's special for our team to play against a third-party player.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg won the 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home to the 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Association Cup 2016/2017.
Title defender is third-level deputies SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and head of institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Hofburg in Vienna and to rebuild the Lobkowitz Palace in the Austrian Museum of Theatre.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese recruits a policeman with money
Tim Wiese, a former footballer in Bremen, never noticed.
Soccer was once, Tim Wiese, ex-national gatekeeper in Germany and committed to Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, on the other hand, he hasn't taken advantage of it.
Wiese just cut her hair in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard issuing a bill for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the business, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "picture" magazine reports.
At the city of Bremen one confirms the accusations, is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"This is still under test," says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are well suited for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For three days, the authorities of Panama have taken out the 4,500 plants and burned them.
Men plow on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, was reported to follow his two friends at a distance of about five metres and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the BFT service.
There were also three people on the gas station site.
One of these men now yelled at the young people and struck them with fists.
The victim suffered a break in the nose and bleeding heavily out of the nose.
When his two friends came along and complained to the striker, he initially abandoned his victim.
His friends brought the injured young man home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and demonstratively passed there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the striker and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical attention.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second bat is supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and advisers to report under phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, business promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be on his side with half of his successor in the next few months.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests EUR 310000 in the premises on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently studying at the Verden hospital and wants to get into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was time, I just called her."
The Muller couple liked the idea of owning their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
As an advantage, he sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so one agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family-father Frank Müller also grew up, followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical clinics as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed an emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and is volunteered in the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to settle down as home doctors.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a more voice room.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
Mullers receive a grant of a total of EUR 50000 as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) and from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," emphasizes Samtgemeindeborgermeister Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, some 2000 patients enter the practice of Felstehausen every quarter, with an average practice of about 500 in northern Germany.
In Asendorf there is another doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practice taken over by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller's speech hour will continue to look into familiar faces: takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen remembers smiling.
She feels a little pain after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds: "We have a 6000-square-meter base."
"But I've always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can do so "of course".
The people's supply and security are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that "it needs clear signals," said the Minister.
People need to know that we do not accept cross-border migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considered "Corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to allow refugees arriving to travel to Austria and Germany and may also set up corridors for refugees.
However, this was not the case with the Minister of the Interior, Vesna Györkös Znidar, in Laibach.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia would instead intensify the surveillance of the border - especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, was already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
However, as the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to cut its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had tried to get past the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in East Croatia during the night hours on Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days his country will count with about 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government, however, argues that it is the people who are instructed to take certain routes: "We can't, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the early days a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, and more buses were expected during the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue their journey through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to an already predicted shift from the previous Balkan route to Turkey-Greece-Macedonian-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more western route by observers.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are being carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been one of these since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving the country a good witness since then as to the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the night at the Horgo border crossing leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm the local eye in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he considered the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
It would not currently be very high numbers of refugees.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Help advice migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are listed.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area there are still uncleared mines 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mineowners had been sent to the border region.
Stock Exchange Hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who are accused of having gained insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information collected should have been used to produce insider transactions in financial markets.
According to the investigators, this was a total of over 100 million dollars.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused persons in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is active operation.
People do their errands, partly quick steps, partly cozy.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Automobilessalon at Paradeplatz.
Keeping city railways.
Pulsifying, splendouring life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large boards each with the title "Before I die I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospital Aid drew attention to its 20-year existence with this action and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid is also available to passersby for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some passers-by spontaneously grab the chalk and add to the sentence of "feeling my life", "reading", "driving with the camper through the USA", "stop the war" or "not suffering for long", others stop for a short time, read, say sentences like "I'm not that far yet" and then go on.
Time and again small discussions on the action itself, on life, on how to deal with death develop on the margins.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only when I realize that the end will eventually come for me in this world can I live responsibly," says the director of the deaconic work Mannheim, who is together with the Caritas Association of Ecumenical Hospics.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that everyone does not want to make public announcements on the boards, and this is a very personal matter at last.
The theme of death and death is still attached to taboo, according to Josefine Lammer's experience, although the hospice movement has contributed much to the people's opening up in recent years.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning attendant is one of the volunteer employees of the first hour.
Through personal experience, she faced the topic, read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in dying aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice sought volunteers by phone, she immediately reported and was present at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who are accompanied by individuals and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in San Vincent Hospice.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see the life of another wait, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free and free of charge.
The financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training, training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years, training courses are offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be listed on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that she is planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to recruit 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The share fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84 according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite the rise in prices, which averages 4.9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November onwards.
The company said that it still expects that earnings will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid revenues when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, predicting twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has stagnated its sales in its Express shipping unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales of land transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares sank by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $10.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Threatening over them at the end of the decorated, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are supposed to put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a twofold mandate from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start off from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solidly, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate on federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus as to what the Fed will do, which in itself dissuades the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, financial markets expect a waiting of the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the impact by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial averaged 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week," said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to lift the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on the right track to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world collapsed at the end of last month after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average was more than 16% below its peak in May, when investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would thwart global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May peak.
For Fed representatives, the market turbulence affects the complex calculation when increasing interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn't occurred in the last few weeks, they would have put on the reins in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former US note bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get better control of the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there's almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, therefore it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world's.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication of Ben S. Bernanke’s then leader in 2013 that Fed could "contend" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee who is committed to an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite the limited recognizable impact on growth in the US", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts decreasing.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate fixing committee.
The recent turbulence is not near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are exhilarating," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should advance time.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/stock was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often known as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/storage is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to slip through the corridors.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is located near the checkouts and has various take-away options.
What there is here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and bile, pig’s natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To offer you a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She is also happy to teach with her 74 lentils.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum-seeker's house on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a real school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly tell women how important a good diet is during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal councillor Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for a solar system.
Planning for the long-awaited gymnastics building at the Bernrieder Sportgebiet is progressing step by step: the latest municipal council meeting unanimously blessed the project proposal without much discussion.
The Board had previously decided, among other things, on an application for a "exemption" or "exemption" from the valid building plan.
The "exception" was about permission for a special form of roof construction.
This means that a "saddle roof with a non-middle first and a roof top" is to be built.
The planning background is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will bring us a wonderfully large southern roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In turn, the "liberation" was about the roof inclination, which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike those prescribed in the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary, because the plan of construction does not allow for "exceptions" in relation to the roof inclination, whereas the Bernried municipal council is usually more restrictive in the case of liberation requests.
Turnhallenbau is not, however, a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent for this," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau am Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at cost.
Grants are expected from school and wide-ranging sports promotion.
In the next process step, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Peissenberg Clinic Goes to Schongau
Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peissenberg with them to Schongau.
This foresees the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by Countess Andrea Jochner-Weiss.
However, a decision on this is taken by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the Peissenberg hospital would continue to work.
The vast majority were to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms were present.
According to Jochner-Weiss, employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
The employees were informed of the plans.
The change triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
According to Jochner-Weiss, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgradation" and a broadening of the offer in the field of "Inner medicine", says Jochner-Weiss.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
In transition for the next two years, when the Supervisory Board agrees, fishermen will lead both houses, until next year the former Hospital of the Union, which still has 35 beds, is finally to be closed in Peissenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Weilheim hospital was completed.
Land councillor Jochner-White, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, has come across rumors that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will be used as accommodation for asylum-seekers in the future.
As the property continues, Jochner-Wiss could not say that there were several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a day-to-day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said Fischer about the Quasi move to the lech, which had been "positive and very understanding" taken up by the employees.
There has not been a real perspective for the house in which fishermen have been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been threatened by closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballs of the Rhein-Neckar lions are required at the Bergische HC tonight (20.15 h).
Although the Bundesliga's table leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, there is no reason for superiority.
In the past season, the Badeners took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do there.
Hunting dune with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shootings during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the aberration on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in operation, as the police reported.
After a shot, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospitals.
How exactly it could have happened to the accident was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Violence
A suspect in crime has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate who have been missing since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as the prosecutor's office and police reported on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, who is also arrested on Tuesday evening, is considered to be a suspect, according to the evidence and led the investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been missed on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on the eve of a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal objects of the victim.
After all, when interviews were held in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing persons, an act was suspected against the 20-year-olds.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrest, the authorities admitted in the police investigation to have killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be presented to the detainee on Wednesday, and the investigators put him to death.
Further investigations are to be made on the details of the facts.
Refugees Need Accommodation: Study Warns of Homelessness
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also looking for a affordable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable apartments.
To meet the demand for affordable dwellings, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing.
For comparison: This year 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
There are 140,000 flats missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then come to the apartment market and get into the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also a major failure in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is pushing forward a housing deficit which is increasing year by year.
Currently, some 770,000 housing units were missing in the conurbations, lamented Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals lived in large cities in need in WG rooms.
Young adults stayed involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flat market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per head had declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives should stimulate social housing.
Thus, the land tax could be waived and the land tax on subsidised dwellings would be suspended for a limited period.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with 184 million euros on Monday evening, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up.
Now the project could even be stepped up.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
There is practically no way through to Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will grant transit via Slovenia to the north without hindrance.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior, and if necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Minister of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border was cut off, hundreds of refugees broke up in Croatia to move from there to Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports Croatian TV channel RTL.
Hungary had closed its border with refugees the day before.
New laws that came into force on the same day make ordinary asylum procedures virtually unnecessary in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can go through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it was people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia's border with the EU-neighbourhood country Croatia in the morning.
Most media reports reportedly come from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
There are other dangers to this: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, no more refugees come to Hungary after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people picked up.
It had been 9380 shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday.
The new Hungarian laws refer to the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The defendants are threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and with deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the "transit zones" newly established at the border, of which almost all - 93 - are the most important transit points of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees had stayed there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the street over the past few weeks.
Locking grids have been dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border area has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction.
After the close of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only achieves a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country after government reports.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday, when ten people suddenly stood with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had stopped the rail traffic with Austria surprisingly on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was in Wernstein for them," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars drove across the border to the Near Passau.
Previously, we tasted the unexpected guests first, with sauces and drinks.
We just said we'd take her by car to Passau.
"That was for us of course," says Stadler in the OÖN-talk.
They were very grateful.
A man could not afford to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
"We were very pleased about this," Stadler said.
On Sunday evening in Wels, the stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau to try to cross the border after the short notice that the rail traffic to Germany had been cancelled.
However, the regional train was set off in Wernstein am Inn in front of the border.
In Wernstein, the cross-border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday sociably, in the days before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending us thousands of zigzags is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the Röszke camp to build structures to ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has publicly and officially pushed the Hungarian government into the dark circle of national socialism.
Unfortunately, these policies are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised country", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create humane conditions for those seeking protection in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter.
And it will be even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to his word having weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The lodging of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday had also taken place without great vortex, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.
Should it become more refugees, we can do it.
"But there is no barrel without soil," said Konrad.
He has already had talks with the national leaders.
These would have assured him that he would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF "Help like us".
Privates can offer simple accommodation on the platform.
In addition, it is hoped for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high" yesterday.
In times of emergency, it may not be possible that quarterors have to comply with a certain height of towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
"Emergency standards" should apply for a limited period of time.
Conrad explains that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he was more successful in accommodation.
I am an older man, who is not told the untruth in the face.
Convincence was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they explained themselves.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
Your own search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better distribution
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center for the Accommodation of Refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as the people concerned can be accommodated without these measures at the moment, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in the event of an emergency, additional sites will be tested for their suitability.
The head of the city is critical of the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute here.
Seehofer: "Margins are not locked"
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state chief Josef Pühringer (VP) has on Monday concorded the further action on the refugee question.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be closed.
The transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany.
However, the searchers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Of the other EU Member States, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity on the issue of refugees.
The fact that Austria also introduces controls at its borders again is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the Germans' actions.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
On four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring which.
From the beginning S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are inquiries.
Lia-Peroni-holder opened second business in the arcade
Furla handbags are at the centre of the new shop.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to lay down a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Doubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project: finally, she has gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything revolves around women's handbags brand Furla, wallets are starting at 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously, several weeks were converted.
"I've been thinking for a long time about opening another store," says Breit.
The decisive factor for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the cradle by her mother.
I am most qualified when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women, when looking at a beautiful handbag, find themselves in a tuxedo, can’t answer the expert’s question with the slightest certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag upgrades every outfit.
The Rulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatinate ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called principals.
This property also combines some with the billionaire who wants to become the US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for intruders.
Whether he is hostile to foreign affairs, is talking about journalists or reveals a lack of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presidential Office strongly stimulates the electoral campaign.
And cut it off well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the Winzerdorf on the Weinstraße.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant place are more than -twenty corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel filmed a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this kind of exciting, but in their Kallstadter kind are not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprösslings, among whom, in addition to Trump, the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it there to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tend to believe that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," says Wendel.
By chance, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsche: die Angegier, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the giver.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold graves facility in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland permanently failed in the Bavarian state of which the Palatinate was then part.
He did not take up Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the polders, it's not as sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the grandfather was born of Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distant, "it's always so uplifting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the Church’s organ during a visit, which generally arrived well.
"I can't imagine Donald doing that," says the 68-year-old.
They would find it better if he did not win the election, for "he has such radical views, I do not know if that is good".
If those who had spoken at the time of his grandfather in the United States had been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzerdaughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will also mature without President Trump".
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemagoers, and also in the USA the interest is aroused.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hands of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the National Park Berchtesgaden on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpenverein is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may not have more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area shall be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it did not make any major shifts in the reviews for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's fall.
The Rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September Sunrise stands at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for checking!

The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
The Seven X-Factor remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17.00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 a.m. to 18:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour filled 720.000.
Hot-seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confidently vote that hot-seat will finally come through at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for a million dollar minute that failed to overwhelm the McGuire show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was covered in great secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last Rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows on the day before being out of three two, you may have accidentally given a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the finale on Thursday
All three women have lyrically left out why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Wood's last Rose?", their answers could become the spoiler, who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-fellows and Markoski both quickly called Mackay the best partner for Wood, except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that in the entire course of the show," said Jeavons-fellows.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her realize that Wood could be "one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unreservedly tuned to him," she said.
And when she was asked who would choose Wood, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's an indecision between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banished Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a gun as much as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit did at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return a point and also to the current game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his lost catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian follow-up to his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble and later told Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the schnitzer with his original debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal area led to a Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posing for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field with weapons force.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, Yukos confiscated his oil company and stopped his democratic efforts.
The Free voters call for the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and political leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools at the start of the FW Autumn Course at Großwallstadt, if there is not enough new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save schools from the collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get faults in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfreaktion der Freie Electoren meets until Friday in the Infrankische Kommune.
Actually, other main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will transcend the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslav War in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to deal with the causes," said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to postpone free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards from the federal states nationwide."
"Bavaria is pushing away, others are not."
"We need to become more capable of action."
However, national policy in Great Wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A permanent burner for many years remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot experiment "middle level plus" in 47 high schools, in which an extension of the upper secondary level from three to four years is tested - in the result it takes nine years to graduate.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The topic of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the high schools that want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Harder Wall Street helps Dax jump
After a long distance, the German stock market has closed down directionless and nervous trade with profits.

The Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy groups recovered, but ultimately lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares increased by another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to a dealer, a positive report of the US investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend was published.

4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she took advantage of rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centralized for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter areas.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The town of Emden wants to market a plot of about 4,000 square meters in a direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post.
Preparations are currently in progress.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, business and housing.
Waiting for appropriate offers, it is said on the part of the city.
Which investor is in question is not yet clear.
No contracts had yet been concluded accordingly.
The city of Emden had already bought a part of the property located on Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement at the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
A number of farmers are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational medicine
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home at the Small Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Emder Council's Urban Development Committee.
Originally, this item had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction who accused the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends went from the System Building Management to the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet," he told the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The ten to twelve million-dollar project has been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among seabud owners who had arrived at the meeting brought out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, seabudenowner and board member at the site's representative, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that overtakes all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly due to the planned size of the facility: "There must come whole busloads in order to calculate it," says Schulz.
However, what is happening exactly on the well-developed area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must first have a coherent concept," Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the building plans were also still variable.
Twin offspring at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to see young people at its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The sex of newborn Gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian has been holding her close to the body.
First, the "picture" had been reported.
NHC predicts a 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide deep pressure system approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical whirlwind in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep pressure system, for example in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google launches the Double Donation Campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a double-donation campaign to spend $11 million on humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations, fleeing from war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations will double up to 5.5 million on google.com/refugee to $11 million.
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven over 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, torn by war.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain degree of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation dropped from 31 to 24,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained similar with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved the diabetes disease and 28% in part.
In the medically-treated group, the diabetes was completely resolved at only one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which over time reflects the blood glucose levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, writes the researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1 %) and had more complete overcoming diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was less likely to die in obese people undergoing obesity surgery than in a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit in terms of survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly paying attention in Belletristik: A young woman, at school hours unpopular and unattractive, meets after years the swarm of her youth, and this one falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Really we're not like that" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be of interest to Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The chief professional author grew up in boredom and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accommodate all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack and pointed out that the US's violent reaction drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11th, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solving this problem is in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he committed violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in the intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report an almost 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavy alcohol hand disinfectants, says the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand disinfection in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children come to these products more and more frequently, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children are deliberately drinking disinfectants while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a gut test in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Adolescents are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol somewhere.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison call centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 Station in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaidah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes from hand disinfectants that smelled after strawberries in school, was brought to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times that of an adult who is legally considered drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah sounded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors watched them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, said Ritchey.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaidah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants out of the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcare professionals suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from her room.
The police considered the failed plan to be "punishment" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a hitchhiking accident on the cross-spange between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old lorry driver drove on the cross-spange towards roundabout industrial area and was too late to notice that two previous vehicles had stopped at roundabout.
As a result, he banged his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a leading Ford Fiesta.
In the case of vehicles involved in the accident, the police reported damage of around EUR 10 000.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumours: No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hopes are in a bad place, but that he will turn that around again.
Hearts will fight SFA for accusation of Neilson and Warburton will be cautious in January-Neuve obligations that could destroy the unit of the cadre
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's 11 meter in the first half-time gave Aberdeen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talk about discord
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bored Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against ten men from Aberdeen, who are now at the top of the table with five points of head.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel that way - but we have to move on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Now it's so important to get together.
Warburton cautiously at January transfer
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was suggesting some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new entries and insists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox framework.
Brentford's ex-chief said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in summer have this preseason time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been struggling with a annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to finish Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson sticks to what he said and insists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was corrected after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the stormer and added, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the downfall on the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back on track," said Donnelly.
McInnes was happy to "wrong" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to fight in despair against Hamilton Accies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that gave them a five-point lead in front of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's 11 meter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in trophy games or leagues, the games of this kind haven't even won."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it rises in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged between May and July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunken people dropped the drain
As the security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the sturgeons into custody.
A breath alcohol test showed 0.89 per mille in a 16-year-old.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 per mille and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be a Witness in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in an audience gallery in the Death Chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison shot.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So, why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the US, and since often more applications than places are available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to 5.
Whoever is selected will watch it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit.
I like that guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she could have better formulated it, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police chase convinced to get out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "scrupulously persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale's police were called to a house-wreck incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car into the trench to avoid an alcohol check and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to plan a Ben Cousin Biathlon humorously.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt dipper test at Lidaris, which he could not explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the espionage accusations and did not want it to "exhaust like too high hanging grapes."
"I had no intention of saying anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eightteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - who I'll call when I'm asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should certainly touch their noses because they failed trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, was aware of this at the time and is still there today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and run away from me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now makes her think about it.
But I have now arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'm gonna put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach have been built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of unbeaten Master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "stupid", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has wrongly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
But it was also like that on the race day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," said Moody.
Husband arrested after driver's flight
The police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram on weekends.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood in Shepparton.
It is likely to be accused of driver's flight and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Strikes Against Rivals for Claims of Ring Fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called criticism of his players' tackling as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League NRL favorites.
Sydney Rooster Trainer Trent Robinson said that the referees allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying finale in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed comment about the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the taklimg of his team and said that they were only focused on their "contact" with the takling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It shows up again and again - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year round. But over the last six weeks, we have made contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this happens again and again at this time of the year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "stressing football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "tiring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football playing - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more trust because they say these things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team is free this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the next Saturday evening in the AAMI Park pre-final. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may be threatened with lifelong punishment because of his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came over Vanuatu from South America and was installed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially lifelong punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to own the whole crowd and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape risk at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 to reach his release.
"After reading the solemn statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passport, reports daily to the police and stays at an exit lock of 18:00-06:00.
Accident at A5 near Karlsruhe: Guidehouse breaks apart
A truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening in the event of a car accident with three trucks on motorway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment, as the police reported.
The cab of the causer of the accident completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg phone used by girls to attract pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when it fell asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of obscene images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "concerning" web searches that used terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it, as it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and then he "forgave to be a policeman to frighten them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to frighten pedophiles.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She then also saw the obscene pictures on the phone and confronted the defendant with them.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the charge of having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, to have violated the obligations on January 25 of this year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a security deposit but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was added to the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Lockers deviate from small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are picked up outside the large control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many locks, out of fear of discovery and arrest, left people more at smaller border crossings
On the Austrian side out, said a federal police spokesperson.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There they are received by federal police and forwarded to registration.
According to the Bundespolizei data, there was a significant increase in the number of refugees at the Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 p.m. alone, some 700 people had arrived in the state capital, said a speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Exiter of Tropensturm "Henry" awaited in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of sturmboes in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth was the foothills of the tropical storm "Henry", which had been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest, in the Schwäbische Alb and in the Bodenseekreis there is a bill of 60 to 90 kilometres.
On Friday the sun can then be seen for longer.
The mass does it: every two years the car builders on the IAA show their newties.
2015 is mainly a movement among the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular in demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publication Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be standing with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to ensure that the volume model is also well sold, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an entry below the largest competitor of VW Golf, starting at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euro.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hessen offers additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only five-door.
As a second variant, the Kombi will follow in the spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and an emphatically sporty GT version.
He comes into the trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combination.
Infiniti: Very new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, the Nissan branch wants to find its position in the growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fits fully into the design line of the brand.
The base model will be given a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm) according to the manufacturer's specifications.
The start of the sale of Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën depositor placed above all hand on the front part: Here, the radiator grill was redrawn and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and for the first time integrated Apple's CarPlay.
To this end, a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI were added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of humans
The Federal Constitutional Court gave a judge of the Tegel Judicial Enforcement Office who had been housed in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they were confined to the narrow spaces for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-inmate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space at the Berlin-Tegel Judiciary Centre between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated by space.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, was now on the loose again, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His indictment for the unworthy conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case back to it for further examination.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
The Board of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons of the period in question, only a few days of imprisonment would be decisive for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, "a disguise of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared".
The court now has to clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, they only awarded compensation to a prisoner because he was naked locked up in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy of human beings.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner's unworthy accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009.
The plaintiff was housed in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case from 15 to 21 hours a day for more than three months.
The Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines over the last few weeks because of the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore kept in prison for 23 hours, aggressiveness is increasing, even beatings are said to have come because of the tense situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 jobs in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people, 19 are due to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again, we can do this, and we can do it".
What is due to Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) dwellings are used annually - i.e. for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing, however, is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 600,000 to 80000 social housing units fall annually from the price fixing, and for these particularly affordable apartments refugees will apply.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing units should be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says Migration Researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: the ban on work for refugees to recognise work.
While there was earlier a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the requirement to reside, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the view has prevailed that refugees should be given quicker access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
Up to now, there is no adequate supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in the view of Thränhardt, the Königsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents are giving their children to the kitas, estimated at ten to 15 percent: "It is important for the roots of the parents to keep the family together first," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the kita, the administration distributes handbills in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase greatly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity, for example by allowing more specialised schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
As a matter of principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated study - the only exception has been Berlin so far, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Students who are willing to study could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicant Benefits Act when they start studying.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a faggot, as they do not fall within the circle of the faggot-righted persons.
Endangered refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be Bafög-licensed, from 1 January 2016 this tension is shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap also needs to be closed, as Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk demand.
The students should get bafög right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new arrivals professionally.
The rights also include obligations.
Thus the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to take a firm stand against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to stay here, in Germany, realised," he said at the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested translating the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a topic of society than it is today.
This will also have to change the majority society, making the elimination of discrimination and racism more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has, for a few decades, had an anti-discrimination office and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants' organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-racism Convention require Germany, must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the expected refugees, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacity are concerned, we can do that," he said to the daytime mirror.
However, additional money had to be transferred to the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to be issued to all the locals at the time of registration.
The services provided could be billed with the Länder later.
And in the long term, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of services provided by the Asylum Applicants Act.
Otherwise, the doctors make it primarily possible to create language barriers.
Already so far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proved that migrants are being better informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice should interpreting costs be taken over, she demands.
However, many refugees would already be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV education.
However, with the partly other forms of disease, German doctors came to the fore from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite attack or tuberculosis are not so hard to recognize." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even see relief.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, many refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be able to practise, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out further examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK).
Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK, said that refugee children were particularly vulnerable.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, flashbacks with respiratory distress, dizziness, heart rate and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong fright and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, an early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would most often decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often led to misconceptions, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new production "Leidschaft", the Circus Probst takes back the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the trap of fascinating acrobatics, animal nutrition and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to wash into the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Leidenty" - under this motto is the current man-made staging.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood.
"We need to take people away from their everyday waste and take them to a completely different world for two hours," said the 27-year-old junior chief.
"Manegencocktail with world-city flair", Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 km tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family puts the audience in jeopardy and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to take the Cuban duo away.
Easiness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointiness.
Balancing the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Serpents fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," emphasizes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Mistakes in the attitude of circuses are only all too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also states: "If our animals are not well, we are not well either."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read by the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
So the top commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebraid jumbo, a mixture of a shetland pony stallion and a zebra stute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals lived together in one alley for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst, "Whether five or 1,200 spectators, we always do our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. from 17 to 20 September.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the show at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe makes the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained intact, but the video of the case spread rapidly through the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also trodden by statements by opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with bulwarks.
Last month they had bent him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition-politicians received SMS messages on their cell phones that they warned against interrupting Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said to journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament ends and, as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and services business.
The expected job losses result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in their transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on providing unreachable, integrated technology solutions for companies so far," says the company's statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the match against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly uncertain.
The big shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the preseason.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs that have most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellellín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need it to enjoy a little snow break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal’s clear favorites are to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lessons from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope that with his management he will lead the club to his first European-Pokal-Triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
Arsenal's never made it.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year-old height.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Misable (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style of substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more deeply.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in cozy armchairs and the longing of Ross for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a telephone operator explained to me:... "My hearing role for people who feel depressed and are suicidal has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying "I'm getting along with it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you are visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest with the setting that is completely new for the celebration of the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held the course when Paris Saint-Germain launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince's Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champion's League debut as PSG player who set off the French champion, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as it not only strives to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but also to improve on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrated career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or off in the Champions League. Therefore, it's a good start, 2:0 to win, to cause our opponents problems and to look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't achieved one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which on weekends held a 2:2 undecided in their own place against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing tower was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö Defense, before he left Johan Wiland beautifully in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed PSG would win a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed by Kevin Trapps' post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mispasses and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts, pattered alone in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skillful when he brought his co-players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan reached its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had struck a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before Ezequiel Lavezzi became known as a goal at the end.
The coach from Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The skills games are not enough."
Take off before Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, who is affected by falling commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt resolution plan.
The company Glencore, registered in London, said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China’s economic downturn pressures demand and is devastatingly affecting markets.
The issue of subscription rights brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange on early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.50 billion stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to cancel around one third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new investments at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw material prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a most long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and returns President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a State Minister this evening after the two leaders have had bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before he travels to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns regarding China's alleged cyber spying and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously just a few years before Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In the summer the 35-year-old left Barcelona FC after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 before his departure from Barcelona.
"They told me Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't," he says.
And that's what FC Bayern registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In memory: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change did not come about.
And the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's season 2008/2009 would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, turned off the reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the King-Class Triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted the African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday night by HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you occupy the film and not when you occupy the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shockedly, with insulted disbelief and called out "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of The Martian's actor strengthened.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I would like to encourage people to think - whoever will be the director - about how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown first said.
The only black person, and she's a hooker beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People worked for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director's rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before disapproval of Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain her diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenage man Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged legislators and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colored restraint.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums quiet matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter have published an explanation in response to the issue of Fox News Personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
The first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and take home the big prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all the stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finals, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
The British finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!Messages after the hard-hit victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his pile of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why the British, although the first ever to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a eighth season, the shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but on Tuesday this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to get up within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard site.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit the 1/3 Innings six times and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen of every game, and therefore I want to go into the game very carefully.
The designer Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He swung the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (stroke training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he put it right into the game.
With three runs in reverse at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks achieved a lot, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by Blaine Hardy's left-hander.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designed rookie hitman Miguel Sano, who enthralled right-hand Drew Verhagen with a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth innings, the wall created an RBI double against the closure of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and reached the score of 5-4.
However, the right-hand man stood out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a Phil Hughes who was not yet mobile to start the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had missed more than a month due to a back suffering.
"Of course not the beginning I wished for," Hughes said, "but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler after they got the leadoff battery in the first.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scored a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-fielder Anthony Gose to the 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the right-hand owner A.J.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez was exonerated due to injury to the caster.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list due to a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers, since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 because of a breakdown in the right thigh.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen, according to the government Bureau responsible for initial admission.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be possible.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective looking away".
Four years ago one was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is on the verge of our doorstep," he said at the Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany Austria also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner stated on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF that no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leiter said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Her goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU Member States have so far been unable to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU Interior Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting next Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee trend in Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany wants to strengthen its support for the countries in the first reading and distribution of people.
The Confederation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of discussions with the Prime Minister at the Berlin Chancellor Office.
Merkel underlined that those people who need protection would also get them.
But those who do not have a stay perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was explicitly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-kilometre border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also cut off the border with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent towing diverting routes across Romania, said Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who cut the fence.
According to eyewitness reports in Turkey, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icepanzer of Saturnmond Enceladus is a global ocean.
This includes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily swirls around the ring planet on its orbit.
Although this blush movement is only small, but still too large for a consistently firm celestial body, it is said in a communication from Cornell University in Ithaca (New York, U.S.) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
For example, in 2006 "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturnmond, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at that time.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up on offensive actor Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor violation in the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis means "presumably four weeks of forced pause".
"This is hard for us, Rama is a very severe loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "picture" magazine, with a view to the possible commitment of a single professional.
As a trainee guest, however, the Sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croat has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torhunter Rubin Okotie can return to the team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player will enter the running training.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent blow on his head.
In contrast to his first fears, he remained without a severe blessing.
No diet-fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often advised by them.
Mangos contains quite a lot of sugar, especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: B-vitamins as well as vitamins E and C are found in them. Mangos contains a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruits thus supports vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not tell us how mature the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very delicious.
You should store at room temperature and be consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangogutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The UPS U.S. package service hires up to 95,000 helpers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company had already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
Last year UPS had already increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 assistance.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making earlier arrangements to be armed for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First, a storm, then a marked cold front.
The next night, in the valleys of the Alpennordside der Föhn, breaks through, as Meteozwiss announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday, the hair dryer blows partly with storm power through the foehn valleys.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rains, windbugs and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep pressure area across the British islands in a strong south-west stream.
On the Alpennord side breaks through the valleys in the night to the Wednesday of the Föhn.
As a result, the hair dryer blows in the foehn valleys until Thursday morning with a bow from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland also partly with over 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can reach the neighbouring middle country, and on the mountains even hurricane bays of more than 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryers provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the moisture on the alpine south slope begins to stand.
Here is rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps will have to be counted for the next 48 hours, with some over 100 litres of rain per square metre, after falling in the last few days.
On Thursday morning the hair dryer goes out of the air, and then a cold front with strong, partly whited-through rain rolls over Switzerland from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go back significantly.
The following days will be presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino was baptized on Wednesday a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now honoured as "German Theologian of Reformation".
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the centre of ancient Rome.
The names had been applied for by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes could often live as a minority only in secret.
With the place become symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for several months as a young Augustine monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at the time as a trumped-up scapegoat.
His negative impressions, according to historians, should have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome.
With his theses against the indulgence trade, Luther had then initiated the division of the Church of the Netherlands.
Hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning, the image was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colours and imaginative shapes has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite gloomy.
About three years old, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books.
Cycles have been created that devote themselves to such topics as the Way of the Cross, Plagues, Commandments or Our Fathers.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages chosen by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of ancient painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and each set of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry cover has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old equally allows double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately at all triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, came from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant men's hater order.
"The education has already happened with the reedstock," remembers Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps to put up with myself again with the Lord Father."
His second concern was to help art in a fast-paced time to become more important: "The perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being pushed out there.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants viewers to "fall into" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, to be "always" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old has not been careful to grasp the Bible fully but has chosen the important, mysterious topics for him.
"This was not an eye-to-eye collaboration," Altepost says: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
A part of the original images - paper and canvas - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will be opened on 15 November at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction start for BMX train seams
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, earth hill modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was finished.
Failures in politics and administration caused disappointment, especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So hill moved, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for construction permission.
The approval would be received in October, the first municipal councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now inform the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
It was then to be started without "further commemorative pause" with the work at the former indoor pool.
DFB intensifys commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, and the Bundesliga makes a clear sign on the weekend.
Soccer reacts to the acute situation in Germany and assures politics its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
"I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"No one can say in principle that it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"Everyone must be interested in getting this topic under control," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'll be at the chancellor's office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"There the topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But the decisive course must be to put politics.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," said Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal leagues also support this programme.
This weekend, the 36 professional clubs set a clear mark if they will wear the "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Picture" magazine (Tuesday) and called the project "of course".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one can look away."
"We football federalists can, no, we need to use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
The women's national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM qualification game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their places had started their own projects is great.
Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued will live in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will make available €300,000 for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP Chief Executive Officer loses an eye in the event of an accident
According to Bill McDermott, the CEO of Europe's largest software group has lost its left eye by a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the USA, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He almost bled, was powerless, then dragged himself out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could do his job.
"At the beginning of October we met before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Süddeutsche Zeitung) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
He felt it important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said, "Everyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen twittered an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he crashed from the wheel.
He is therefore just as unlikely to be a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend in Singapore as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Soccer: BVB without a giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group match of the Europe League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missing the leader of the football league in duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 a.m./Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot resort to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
In view of the high burden on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his tribal life on the giant position.
So he announced a change on the goalkeeper position.
Roman Weidenfeller therefore occupies the place of the keeper Roman Bürki.
"He is training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weed traps will be used in all European League games in the future, Tuchel left open.
He will most likely also contest the second game.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, sees Middlefield player Julian Weigl as comprehensible: "This does not mean that Marco is so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic Cars: Government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in the transformation of the car of technological pioneers.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car fair IAA about a "new mobility age".
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce congestion, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss this issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet representatives of industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being built on motorway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to ensure that "no additional liability risks are imposed on the driver", the Federal Government intends to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany intends to work internationally to increase the maximum speed allowed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government is also committed to an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
When automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "to be expected well beyond 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany is estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra testing organisation presented on Wednesday at the AA concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will come through in the next ten years, 32 percent expect this only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the USA.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the journey on all roads.
At least 15 percent of the traffic on the motorway could be in traffic, 45 percent in traffic.
Good every fourth would not leave the car under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at table tennis-EM
According to the current state of play, the Düsseldorfer wants to pitch only in detail in the title battles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys heard about it in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at this time on the flight at a long-term scheduled sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite," said Einzel-European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
However, the Hamelner, who leads the list in Ekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also missed, and we have become European champions."
"We should focus on this," explained the World Rankings Five.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury to the right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a breakdown in the tibia with the 20-year-old companion of Bastian Pigeon.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure gravel cabinet: designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: window dolls, which, thanks to video projections, look frighteningly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and that he was wearing men's skirts.
"I can't say today that I am the Enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the Bürgersteig on the running ladder), which can be seen from September 18 at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is a good thing that the fashion maker has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he had been against it, because: "To me, an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris stations.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the man's almost unsurpassed work, which has written fashion history, without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which much effort has been done: For example, to decorate the dolls, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been carried by the makers to Munich.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi says Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("Women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, savvy fashiony look.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he put on his Teddy bras and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play with him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show he could not pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener tip as fashion niche
In the past, it was on the long knitting machines in and around ploughing to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and laces were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed them into blankets and curtains.
That alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauen peak, fashion played a greater role, then was pushed away by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niches.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as pockets and regional costumes.
At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which leans on past stylepoks, represents an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauener Spitt und Embroideryen industry association.
Only they may wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of turnover had been lost.
There are almost no more private trades and wholesale trades.
Our products hardly reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian area and sold almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, export weaknesses, currently to Russia and to the USA.
Sufficient reasons, then, for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to point out environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have carried out a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially tolerable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplomdesigner Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Ausstelle der Westsächsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the businesses that need to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter reinvigorated the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krouße was inspired by this: "Before I could not start with a traditional plauener tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitt - young and old," Reuter says.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memory.
This is how I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador to the Plauen peak.
Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not meant to touch, but Disney dares to make a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a re-filming, but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open up the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly in order to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group commissioned to steer the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-ups strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th Central Leadership Group meeting to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and will provide a new place for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access regulation, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overreach of the resident currency system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and enterprises that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, ensures a regulatory business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
An offer to open state-controlled sectors will open up further areas for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their duties and the use of professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also included Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus to provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of neurotoxicity.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, strongly criticized the plans: "Risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full weight to pregnant women and toddlers," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of neurotoxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
Large predatory fish, however, are already so heavily burdened with mercury that on the basis of the limit values still in force, about 50 per cent of the catch cannot be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this relaxation, according to Foodwatch, the EU intends to increase the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this a "trick" because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are often so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfect diversion manoeuvre that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is greatly enriched over the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "a small quantity can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, explains on its homepage that a "health threat to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury comes mainly from coal combustion into the environment.
According to a written report by the Federal Environment Ministry, the German coal power plants emit more than six tonnes of mercury per year to the Green Federal Member Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fishes, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, was "permanent and far-reachingly exceeded", the "mirror" quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU's RASFF warning system.
