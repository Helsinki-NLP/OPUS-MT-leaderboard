Tom will not appear at all.
I should have imagined myself.
Let's practice.

I told Tom I'd be right now.
Still, my son believes in Santa Claus.
I hate driving.
Sami must wait a bit.
Are they friends?
Tom knows all about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now-now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.

Excuse me, may I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It's raining.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that river.
I only bought a new pair of shoes.
We want it back.
The game begins tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father had recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know all about her.
I'm falling in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
It does not matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kyoto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God did not exist, we should have thought about him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
She's not here.

I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to keep looking.
Tom had a lot on his plate.
Do you choose red or white wine?
This is the next one!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot about her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, Kyoto and Nara, for example.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat whatever you want.
It's really good!
The river that flows through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
