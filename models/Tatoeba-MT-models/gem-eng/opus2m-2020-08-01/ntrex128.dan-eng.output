Politicians in Wales are afraid to "like fools"
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly about a proposal to change their title to the Member of the Welsh Parliament.
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
AMs from all over the political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could lead to ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because "it rhymes on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire-English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently putting together a legislative proposal on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on the names that Members of Parliament will receive is, of course, up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, in which there was broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or WMPs, but the MPs had the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle for consensus can prove difficult for the chairman of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to put together a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on reforms contains other changes in the way in which the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what they should be called when the bill is being debated.
Macedonians shall vote on changes in the name of the country:
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote will be taken in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposes the vote and says that he will vote against it.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is only a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I have spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People socialize in other ways these days," he said.
"Bars no longer constitute the living rooms of the neighborhood, where people enter on a daily basis."
Compared to churches, he is concerned that the money collected from selling assets does not last long and that they are "before or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of people of the kind who do not help the return resorts of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches eventually close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had operated nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bellplay "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's found no compensation for him.
What has been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been caught by church leaders, others by the diocese.
In July, the Council of the Congregation – the governing body of the parish, composed of leading laymen – wrote to the bishops about concerns that the diocese "would try to push the expenses forward" to the Council of the Congregation, even though the Council of the Congregation had not been involved in appointing the architects and contractors whom the diocese sent in.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark hurts 13-year-old on a dive for lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then with a group paddling over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just a thrill to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried out, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
"Here his crib was torn up," said Hammel, and he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out that everyone should come out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's uncertain what kind of shark that attacked.
The lifeguard Larry Giles said by a media briefing that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was traumatized by his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the line from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take up the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up the competition with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of storm gasses.
As part of a great effort to absorb the UK beauty market, which has a value of GBP 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while fashion and home products are falling. The larger rows of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and launched in several shops next year if they turn out to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets look for new products for shelves previously used for televisions, microwaves and residential products.
Sainsbury's says that they double their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches the range of Boutique Makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop tests accommodation in two Sainsbury's shops. The first one opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second one opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small quantities of food daily from local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the stores are going to look like storm traps, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales outlets since they bought both chains two years ago.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended with a dispute on how to distribute the profits of the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury carpentry brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and decor of our rows of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the ingesting environment and the practical locations mean that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones "rapid", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to GBP 11 million
Dragons' Den-star Peter Jones left behind "racial", after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from his contract to GBP 11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-Star Peter Jones furious, after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "rapid" when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, her new agreements – with a value of up to GBP 1.5 million – meant that she no longer had enough time for their home product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of GBP 11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she should have dealt with over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods in the headquarters of Marlow, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the report from This Morning host, which is among the highest-profit stars in the UK, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
And it can also be the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and master Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall be a fire ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as a host at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business."
Hard talk, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the criticism he would get from the news media to give a comment that "is not a president worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a news sword.
"I gave up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting, after Trump announced their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told the world leaders of the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "correspondent reaction" from the US in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view of the speech at his electoral meeting.
"It's going really well with North Korea," he said.
"There was an uproar for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had produced positive results – the end of raketests, the help with the release of hostages and the repatriation of earthly remains from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tightly packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes are fighting the island and killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations, for example, were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboks’ population were homeless, no state of national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it has been clear that they do not request international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national emergency response, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency response.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, the country is very badly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refuges have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastlines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamis are missing, and it has probably affected the death toll.
Even under the best conditions, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's poor infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and trains.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by the lack of funding in the run-up to the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko is also experiencing pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge cancels out at the last moment towards Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a scoring on the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's target, while his team was back with 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot against the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting into the position of getting the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-game, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea-angriffer delivered the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before setting the speed on the midway and squeezing into Liverpool's orbital hemisphere.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle lane.
He then made a long episode that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended against the most distant pole with a left foot shot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the Champions League group game at 15 Wednesday at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rates from tsunami in Indonesia rise to 832
The death toll of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832 informs the country's disaster preparedness early Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the rubble from buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judge scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with rubble from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the most recent memorial of the debate on "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and an "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas's actions in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony to attitudes in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate image is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure representing one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth tribute and memory."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated artery and embalmed in blood near a pig path on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, South China reported the Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs injections of vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had allegedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The following morning the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig path next to it was open.
He said there was a big whore in the pig's path with blood in his mouth.
A forensic study confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin, who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police are collecting evidence at the crime scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarest, but there are previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their property in Massachusetts and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 - kg pig forced a Welsh farmer against his tractor, into his wife's scare away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
"They're just plaything sick.
Those snaps, they're very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States
As predicted, the Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring severe floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America over the coming days.
Rosa had a 38 m/s win, a category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure outlet is forming across the Pacific, moving east towards the US west coast. As Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure outlet that is approaching and will create heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating falls and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain with up to 51 to 76 mm of rain per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great likelihood of storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can transform canyons into roaring rivers and thunder will create powerful local winds and create dusty winds.
The approaching low - pressure outlet will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and smooth roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the area of Four Corners Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains relatively warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the north-eastern regions.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million so Thursday's gripping testimony from the nominee to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement made by a senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in drunken state was grunting at her and tried to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional testimony that he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company listed average viewer counts on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available ratings from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it is a viewing figure that corresponds to a match under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionable hosts have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted all day long, said Nielsen.
ABC was second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican sent out a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while protesters shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judicial Committee.
He stood with a depressed gaze for several minutes while he was being reviled, and CNN sent live.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent out a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in committee.
All the television stations covered live hours later when the Judicial Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour of the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee the following week, which the democrats, who are in the subcommittee of the Senate, had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with her friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had an influence because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the right to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "play politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to that with Theresa May on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "all through ridiculous".
Shot rope on Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of negligent manslaughter, said the Baton Rouge police.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After Simpson was questioned, the police said he confessed to the shooting at Wayde.
His bail is set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge Parish sent out a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot that went from head to neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police station, the Southern University police department and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation leading to the arrest.
The sports manager at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "cracked" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern quarters of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumble and tremors over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on automobile windows in Mexico City districts such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the judge scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police collide with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters wanting independence, coincided with rioters as several thousand participated in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's polar vote on liberation.
A group of masked separatists held rioters back, threw with and powder paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fights also occurred later in the day, where the police used their rods to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups cried out "Not forgotten, nothing forgiven," and were met with Unionist demonstrators who cried out "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The vote is still very tense in the region of independence one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the electorate's accession was low, and those who opposed the detachment boycotted the vote in a large way.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote during violent clashes at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dares hope that Catalonia can achieve independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at having been given the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Although they got a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have fought to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either moved into exile or are in detention waiting for judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There'll be more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Mr Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would be taking part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The position as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the setback in democratic values and the undermining we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a car repeatedly bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The incident happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7.30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at the car at some point.
Shoots from Menga give Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The risers Livingston overrun the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the league this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will receive a visit from Rapid Vienna in the Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated stripes to six games, and Chief Coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Chances of Cash Endurance
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, and their direct playing style created great problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but handed in across the target, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's transversal header in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give the endurance problems in the event of death.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers went freepark, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the stage for Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was virtually not challenged.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goalie Allan McGregor, and Littgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were continuous episodes in Livingston's field, but they were averted, and two demands for a penalty park – after Halkett's battle on Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Possibly" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Famous effort and strong result for Livingston.
Everyone played fantastic and exceeds the expectations of their uphill journey.
Their playing style and troops are largely unchanged since their return to the best league, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way in which he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were a lot of heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under the level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they got the naked home team – and it is a quick wake for Rangers, who is in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cool
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreement on areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's rapprochement with the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cool to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a lot of supporters appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also took note and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept them.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest who is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accidents en route in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were saviors on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the site, on Children's Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been relocated, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during unrest
Six prison officers have been harmed in distress in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
There was unrest in the prison of HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST on Sunday, and the unrest is still going on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been picked up to deal with the riots involving eight prisoners and going into one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial damage on site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and are clear that those responsible are reported to the police and can end up spending longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, rioters were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm floods (dry areas can take advantage)
It is rare for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape in the south-western United States and create a risk of storm flood.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings about storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday on arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the border with Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center provide 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated volumes up to 152 mm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-western desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with 102 mm locally possible.
For those outside the risk of storm floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will do good because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.
According to U.S. dry monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to land on the peninsula of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa still has the hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become powerful and cause great risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with a potential of up to 254 mm," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona early in the morning Tuesday as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert region of the United States," reported the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to create life - threatening storm floods and floods in deserts as well as mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police in Avon and Somerset say.
Officers have called on all those who may have mobile recordings of the incidents to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was subjected to the democratic party's "wrath and anger"
"A voice on Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a voter's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh made a statement in front of Congress Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was committing sexual assaults for her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement of witness at the hearing on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice at the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice confirming one of the most skilled legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a fantastic past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while he spoke of the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-election polls.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me," he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, one person has been high placed in the Republican party told CNN.
Several hundred killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death toll is growing
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a great earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu City on Friday, when up to six meters [6 m] high waves hit the coast at dusk, many sucked in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami arose after an earthquake that measured 7.5 on the judge scale.
"When the tsunamit puzzle arose yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach. They did not immediately run and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNP, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, the dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before the coast hit.
More survived by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness has published aerial photographs showing many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterdunnings continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Board (BPPT) said in an announcement that the energy generated during Friday's great earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the rubble from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living here," said Red Cross in an announcement, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts not to inform us that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In amateur recordings shared by social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building that desperately shouts warnings about the tsuamia coming closer to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a major power failure that cut off the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reporting authorities, but there is still a great deal of need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have come safely to Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the yard by their account. They came past areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Dosheba.
"They told me they so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organisations began to work hard to restore relief work, complaints arose that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad may only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'OK, it's a national disaster', we can open up international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family held to the missing people in the hope that their closest ones would be the miracles that shed light on the dark tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been caught under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subando, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were among his students.
"As a vet in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were at the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one gray fly instead of two blue ones.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Twenty takes 26,750 USD while filling up the ATM in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's staff member who was fulfilling a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up the back of the Brink's employee" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
Please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680, all with information on the identity of the thieves.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the shift on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote, "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change takes place prior to his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the show creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also changed between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches 50 years for a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "would never ever use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Tropper shot at a peaceful demonstration in place on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 300 at a time when left-wing student movements were raging in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening up several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the US government have issued statements on artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind with the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is Managing Director of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highly ranked American Othello player, and later he became head of Microsoft Research and Director of Google's division in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionary could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have been offered work permits automatically.
The China State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that is equivalent to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money by other government organisations to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a joint centre of artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over USD 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, American legislation trying to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has remained silent for several months.
Macedonians shall vote on changes in the name of the country:
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old conflict with Greece that has blocked Macedonia's attempts to obtain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country towards the north constitutes a requirement on Greek territory and has therefore used its veto when Macedonia has applied for admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the electorate will make up the 50 % required for the vote to become valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means more secure lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote and assert it.
The change of name would require a majority in Parliament of two thirds.
The state electoral commission said that no irregularities had been reported at 3 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66% of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country’s name, which would open up to membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje prepared Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents that were set up by those who will boycott the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to achieve membership with raised foreheads, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to be like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strongly needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his vote.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the vote – less than the required turnout.
Another poll made by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-Western government since it took place last May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights through the entire Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentinean attacker received an episode on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before he starved into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He fought past one defender and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a left-hand episode and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to outsmart Brighton goalie Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told the reporters.
"We talked about him playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
That target came in after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before he led Sterling towards the farthest pole.
The Sky Blues-controversy pinned the ball into the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to tease Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the caste on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participation in playoffs for Rockies, who have played a game more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies held at least in a wild-card slot with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Friday night, but still has their first division title for good.
"Even if we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the game well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet issued the start-up statement for Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer in as pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the record for the 34th time, trained his pitch Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right-hand player from Washington is on 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding an electoral meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the mid-election polls.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote for me, but you're actually voting for me. That's why I'm travelling around fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power with all the means available. You can see how evil they are.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going to run over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "fight and block."
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, "and called the Democrats angry and evil and vile and lying."
He spoke of the highest democratic senator in the Senate's judicial committee, Diane Feinstein, by name, which triggered the loud bow of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you lick the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a large number of Labour MEPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have expressed our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship campaign was about criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the convening of the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday evening meetings have been just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings is not so today, and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics is far behind in the past if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are considered whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared a political stance, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion to the public – and it really doesn't matter what I say – a long series of rough messages follow the social media that calls for the withdrawal and contradiction of the middle-seeking policy and tells me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the will to fight among my colleagues who every day are overcrowded with sexism or racism, but still fight on.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
In reality, however, it is no longer a spacious organization, and with every vote of censure or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I'm not so loud, I'm gonna have to "get through".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a fallaway state, and I sat down to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city council member or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country comes to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the local voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no kind of threat of renunciation or political suitability will keep me from acting on the basis of what I believe is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr will be top ranking
Two late scorings may have got the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastic entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only undefeated team of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of opportunity that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely entitled to be satisfied.
"Our struggles have been demanding so far, and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's scoring after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded for the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a scoring that was not followed by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayrs' leadership with a penalty park just before the half-game. He scored and then got a solo choir, so there was 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, which was followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on the stretcher. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the jump with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Working Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back again and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick within the poles and followed up with a more almost right after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe caught up with David Armstrong's box kick and sent the winger Gregor Henry off to the home track's fifth scoring.
Still Game-star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game-star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it came to the conclusion that he has taken the director's position for an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character of together with his partner Greg Hemfill.
The duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kläng is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Klaufer would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": The Indian State of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the Navy headquarters, covered in rains, in La Paz.
On public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country of Bolivia, there is still a strong reminder of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict on resources, and so is the longing for re-sealing in the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court on 1 October after five years of voting.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will agree that Chile – after decades of discussion – is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial election campaign next year, is also at stake on Monday's judgment.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
But analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would be no major change if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which sits in the Netherlands, has no power to hand over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice gave judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have given way to setbacks.
"The story of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' war rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision-making process of the Court was abnormally rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific," he added.
"The court order is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to respect promises made during a summit in Singapore between the rival leaders.
His comments were given in response to the apparent relaunch of the locked nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a 'wanted dream' to continue sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to declare as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread scepticism as to whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headgear that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you'll find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk veiled for a collection of remarkable headgear of extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hat has dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a sumptuous with a feather-like wide shadow that covered the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selected by bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched up lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation looked like a snorkel and masked scuba diving thing, and others looked like a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you're lucky.
Spectators predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 centimeter-wide shadow, which is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand, behind the most impractical hat that was spread over the social media, has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange sauna bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in ordinary shops next summer. The designer has had such a great influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools have many great academic achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with a number of outstanding exam results, which are also reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a training sector that can put together and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he'll hit that head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike the heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year that languages are highest in the statistics with most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCI's 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students were graded A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who were studying German, 69 percent of those who were studying French, and 63 percent of those who were studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as topic selection at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools pensa and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission carried out in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were unable to fill vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of linguistic skills.
Therefore, linguistic skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require linguistic skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start for the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach in languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills required to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the training.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this distinction to the youth of Scotland.
I'll have a beer faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who will watch LeBron James play his first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing in Sunday's opening game before the season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James most likely won't play the whole game.
After the training earlier this week James was asked about his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six games before the start of the season.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight before the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed Judge to the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is suspended, Trump is trying to support the forthcoming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) the night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's election meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely be talking about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense because of charges of sexual abuse, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation was suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the primary objective of this series of electoral meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five electoral meetings next week aim to "create energy among volunteers and support when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling the Congress is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we are entering the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's election meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to go up to give him a boost in polls," said Simon Haeder, who deals with state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive before Sunday's single duels
After three one-sided rounds, Saturday's four-man duels might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum is a completely invented concept of sport, but a concept that the players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led by six points, and now it's four, so we'll probably see that a little like momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held the fourth.
Of course, Europe has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead, and there are 12 points more to play about.
As Spieth says, however, the Americans feel that they have some wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The loud shouts of cheer increased as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important well, which secured victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two blows behind two duels.
His well that secured them the battle at hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the sort of scream that shows that he does not believe the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just have to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own battle," Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable but sympathetic couple have received four points in four games and appear flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a booky Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided booky's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience show that it is they that are the hardest to hit Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory were to be tamed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over the Le Golf National.
Preferably synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning completely in the four-man duels when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede down into a hole they were never near to get out.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the quadruples have also shown that the Team USA has the spirit of struggle that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe is leading the 10-6 ahead of the last day in the Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the United States of America of 10-6.
The playful duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and have so far received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, trying to win the cup they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an imprecise American team in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. gave more resistance to foursomes, they won four games, but they were still in the back.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles if they're going to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have got the nickname "Molliwood" is after a sensational weekend the only second pair in Ryder Cup's history who have won four points in their first four matches.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then conquered elegantly a brave Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5-four.
Woods, who fought through the first two games on Saturday, had little brilliant flashes, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for tomorrow's fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it as it pleases them, on a lightly blowing day south-west of Paris.
Triple Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a tough 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back to be back with four points before the single games. However, as Furys currently has the cup, they only have to get undecided to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will not disarm unilaterally if there is no trust
On Saturday the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the UN that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust of the United States and that it will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the world-wide organization that North Korea had shown “significant goodwill” in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, settling an area for nuclear testing and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no chance that we ourselves will take first steps and disarm unilaterally."
While he repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-sharing" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as otherwise had been the case with Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested a formal end to the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown opposition to softening international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the American leader pointed out at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris speech was very different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea's rockets against the mainland was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" by North Korea, but this year he praised Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions have to remain until North Korea is demolished.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timetable for these actions, but said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea only a few hours later accused him of making "walking demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile facility as well as an atomic complex, if the United States took "similar steps."
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps" he required were the security promises that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The aim of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where you study all night held up by large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has completed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a presentation on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the assignment was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this only now that I'm on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sporting performance and your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health care area, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises there is a picture of a dorm where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s sporty performance is affected by lack of sleep and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that this will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect your health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride of taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are starving, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped last year Professor Czeisler organize the course when he took one of his courses at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to go up. This can raise awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens, which can move at the dawn and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lower Gerrard and Co.
Rangers suffered another out-of-street defeat when Dolly Menga's goal meant that Steven Gerrard's incoherent team had to thank for a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the field since the 4-1 Triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave it only second defeat in 18 matches as a coach. Thus, there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbroke's Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
Rangers now go down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to a third place after Hibernian with only the goal score to differ.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that seemed to come from the open-air section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached Betfed Cups semi finale by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11, which shaved a point of Hearts' conduct last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted the opponents across the track.
Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Menga's first episode sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt was over.
A deep-seat frispark from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear pole.
However, Rangers took control, but played more in hope than in ability in the attack game.
At least Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson confessed to the Colombian's appeals for a penitentiary when he and Steven Lawless collided after a quarter of a game.
Rangers managed only two shots on targets in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head impact and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Even though the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was a coincidence, it must be said that it is deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't deal with a death ball situation in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it in.
During the break, Gerrard Coulibary replaced Ryan Kent, who almost instantly gave up when the flyer sent the ball to Morelos, but the playful Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the stamina to play on their premises with many long balls up the track from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the lead in the last part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow heated up next to the goal.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton appealed again for a late penalty park after being dried up with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked the other way here.
Yearbook: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we TELL... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a fixed component of both science and popular culture, as can be seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the leading role as Bondian scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals does."
Evans: "Stop it, now it's going on!"
"His" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are re-injected.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "gets several cancers to develop", including breast, ovary, lung and intestine cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an incoherent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was reconstructed when he praised the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand as Presidential candidate in 2020.
After playing tonight's third song Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he started a thunderstorm against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's court committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charges.
Even though the recordings were not shown, comedian Chris Rock Wests was tying on the social media.
It's uncertain whether Rock tried to show West by putting up the footage.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstage because of his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And they said I had sunk deep," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I have sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman jacket because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience buithety at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassingly concerned, explains Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombing in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing with the song I Love It, while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: TAKEN NOT TO LAD YOU OF THE POULTRY."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "as he is, and that's fine."
"But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art"), who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken name changes to the "entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogg rap colleague has been named Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Know as Prince.

The charges shall be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he believes that something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem was "very much on his mind".
"At present, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characteristics.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is to be done?
What is it that young men learn from television and from the streets that makes them feel that they must be men in this way?
I think this is one of our big questions – how do we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer and said that he is "complete with battlefields and horses".
Kit participates from November in a re-recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film director and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best in the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygridte, as Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's country property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, says the health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something near zero, says Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In a year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT individuals is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women before or since because of the country's conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to a lack of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data on Republican senators and dares against "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied Saturday's allegations that a member of her staff has shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles democrat claimed that the claims were from websites and support from the "extreme right wing".
"Lies, lies and more terrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter survey.
The published information contained alleged home addresses and phone numbers of the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday on the web by an unknown person on Capitol Hill. It happened during a hearing in the Senate concerning accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of the Waters staff, writes The Hill.
"This unwarranted charge is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unwarranted charge is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' report quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she doesn't have the right temper to be a congressman.
If you're accused of something you haven't done, you can't get angry.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to stay calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the mid-election, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and the authority of order concerning these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – amazing spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British ice sheet, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the sarcastic self-satisfaction with us become the country's new export potential?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face and the big eyes have been allowed to make brewers again-again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comical invention aimed at places where the cinema visitors do not speak English.
He is of course the tumultuous secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife tip Mr. Bean and properly clasped by him, who performed a single tone to the Chariots of the Fire song at the opening ceremony of the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international lukewarm pants that left chaos in its cold water, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard’s television commercials.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the JE tribe.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite subliminal and strangely redundant, especially now when more "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie party in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the horror of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and ready to fight Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
When her security advisors inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone's pension.
And of course it's Johnny English, who is now the headmaster of a high school, but who teaches in hiding how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock education in espionage.
English hastens back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and is reunited with his hard tried former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an over-enthusiast but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the kingly intelligence service's effort Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling close to being immigrated by the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their raging risky escapades: Dressed as servants, they set fire to an excellent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on the Volta luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the film's closing sequence, but however well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of child's television.
Pretty mediocre.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films, can the English film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that brings justice to his talent?
Labour refuses to barge with plan for four-day working week with unchanged salary for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can only have a four-day working week, but get paid for five.
The party will allegedly have company managers to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have three days weekend without falling into pay.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the party's economic goal of drawing the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year."
"This will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an objective that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workers and to the party's overall strategy for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the objective is not unanimously supported in the Labour Party.
One Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell states that he is determined to take power back from "anonymous directors" and "exploitationists" in supply companies.
The plans of the shadow finance minister also cast doubt on whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour in the lead could "count" them off on the basis of immoral acts.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to set up including owner funds, which will distribute 10 per cent of private companies' share value to employees who are expected to receive up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI finds could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60-minute journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could change their attitude.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was steeled, definite and unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to have been chiseled in stone.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied it," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host city of the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people at Central Park’s large lawn, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal of ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
To receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert walkers have to perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or another meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been, now that they have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another instance of so-called "clicktivism" – that is, people feel that they are making a difference by signing a signature collection online or making a Twitter posting?
Global Citizen reports that since 2011, they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding targets and policy measures, equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which by 2030 are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018 the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over 10 billion dollars that had already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that so far these funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children to live up to their full potential" and promise $35 million to address nutritional problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK Government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 online calls. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In answer to one of the website's frequently asked questions that read: "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen wrote: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements towards apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" Russian energy exports, says the US Secretary of State
If necessary, Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, exposes the U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed that Russia's interference in Syria, especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to expand the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"U.S.A., with our fleet, is able to ensure that there is free passage on the sea routes, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that we ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinc spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that regards itself as "the voice of the American energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and said that they are basically the same.
"The economic opportunities vis-à-vis Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing European exports of liquefied natural gas to replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, speakers of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump has made Berlin the "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project alone.
The Kremlin believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and simply because of economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," said the Russian energy minister, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with American energy minister Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has asked the United States to interfere outside the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," said the head of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election in 2020," says the Senator from Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election after the mid-election, she said on Saturday.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering setting up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in the front line," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I would like to give a strong consideration to the presidential election."
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump to the City Council and said that he "brings the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been voiced in his criticism of Trump and his highest court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a two-day Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course the FBI has to investigate the matter before the vote."
However, an opinion poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren’s own hinterland does not believe that she should set up in 2020.
According to a poll from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the potential candidate.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick by 38% and 48% against a possible stand-up.
Other high-profile democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential elections include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden states that he announces his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at an electoral meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he has come home makes me related to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries with which our soldiers return," she told the audience about a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and become harder. They are thinking about whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, to prevent the report of domestic violence and to be in possession of an intoxicated weapon, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasillas police.
18 States and D.C. support resistance to new asylum laws
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new American law that denies asylum to victims who flee from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-dependent declaration in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union gave in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She states that her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with far-reaching problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum law overturned a decision by the US Foreign Assembly in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new law "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle goes against that principle," says the Party-dependent Declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejection of immigrants harms the American economy, since they are more likely to become self-employed and "provide the necessary labour".
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions removed the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position," said Sessions in its decree of 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should solve all problems – or just all serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu desperate
For survivors, the situation only got worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her little fever-stricken boy at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance comes in with corpses.
We're running out of clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their destroyed home to sort in soaking-up and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were also hit by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke her back and shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He had tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the fifth-story hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I got up against a broken wall, I think," Haris said to the Associated Press and added that his family was going to the wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
American Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American daily that struck the drum for the benefits of an American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The U.S. president, Donald Trump, referred Wednesday to China Dailys paying for entry into Des Moines Register – Iowas best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering in November 6th Congressional elections. China rejects the accusation.
American officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed customs duties on each other's imports.
China's trade war retaliation rate was to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, believes Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a director of Sunday's Des Moines Register that China "obtains the use of the unfine methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by running a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be few dissenting votes. And you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans alienate women prior to the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, warn analysts
While many top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the coming mid-election, especially from women.
The case has put feelings in the boil, and most Republicans have already published that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," said Grant Reher, professor of state knowledge at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona)'s request for an FBI investigation in 11 hours would soften anger voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they won't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill last Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate, the demonstrators shouted: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights," the independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the suburbs and younger voters - 18-29-year-olds - who rarely vote, despite not being in favour of the President."
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to nominate, it would be inconclusive.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final outcome, or whether Kavanaugh is held responsible; it's also about how the Republicans have handled it here and how they have dealt with it," points out Guy Cecil, president of the United States of Priorities – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views about who to believe in after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they thought that Kavanaugh was either probably lying or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee last week that Kavanaugh was fully involved in her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her sex parts at a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to gather resources, processes and abilities to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become redundant."
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a headline on Medium last Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will still be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The spiritual recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I is hailed
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during World War I will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack by Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
Last Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest masculinity" before he alone attacked an artillery and harmless three cannons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann at 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people emphasizes the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you've been up all night watching the starry Bellator 206 and then being denied the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown through the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, the viewers in England were surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this particular battle.
A fan of Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's seniorvice president when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Bellator's Managing Director, Scott Coker, said that they would work to include English viewers in the planning in the future.
"When it comes to retransmission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning over there, and we won't find a solution until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when they changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We only have five games instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "minority" over sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than anyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it didn't matter to him until he got into the bigger classes, that "all aren't like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexuals' rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less inclined to win the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The usual host on the radio program that has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because of illness.
Daley was a guest in Laverna's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his childhood because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feelings about feeling worth memory and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a high profile LGBT champion and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he had been "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when you go through so much at such a young age – he went to his first OL at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed."
"If you had asked me last year, it would be all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had got tickets to London in 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there by then.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it only dawned on me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed of my whole life – diving in front of a home audience at the Olympics. Nothing could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant a lot during the procession to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Unsharp Mickelson on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it's not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who makes a record of being in the competition for the 12th time, which takes place every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Fury because of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the five - time grand winners had to act as cheerleaders and practice their games in the hope of rejuvenation.
Even at the height of his career he had the most direct drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single games, start strongly, Mickelson's fight can be decisive.
Fryk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's how it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite been able to compare with his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven undecided, although Fury said that his presence contributes with something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the holding room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cups single-tracking can quickly become annoying.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but was about to be caught before the finish line with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we only just won," says Bjorn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be full of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what's on the other hand – the best golfers in the world."
Pleasure over the performance of his players on a difficult course added Bjørn: "I don't take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performances that count, and that is something quite different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all the parameters as a golfer.
That's what the players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also get the best out of himself."
It also looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Fryk himself has experienced coups on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miraclet at Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to have a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a great deal of pressure on the intermatches.
We put our team together in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to look backward and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it'll keep us safe all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed again
The German fleet’s newest frigate should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least a year still due to technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is postponed to the first half of 2019 according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but post-delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, will replace the aging frigates from the Bremen class.
About them it is known that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a small need for maintenance: it should be possible to have frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany appear to be an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when they are deployed, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 frigate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
They did not know much about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship useless in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – only half of that crew from the older Bremen frigates.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the fleet to update in the future.
The 7,000 tons of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government's Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of deployable ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He regretted that none of the frigates from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Snipers for the Secret Life of Bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eyed bats and aquatic bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is located in carefully selected locations in the area to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Data is also collected from staff from NTS and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bats and show which species is doing what.
To produce a detailed landscape view of their behavior, a report and a map of their habitat are made.
NTS Rob Dewar nature conservation consultant hopes that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows and how best to preserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flu traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks by pets.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect nests and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the area around Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland's bat species.
The caretaker of the area, David Thompson, says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threate we have a really good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There is a lot you don't know about bats, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before making maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and young people, thereby risking the destruction of an entire local population.
The bats are at peace, and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape, while lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are getting ready to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's said he paid her $375.000 to keep it a secret, wrote Der Spiegel last Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo counted to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-way winner of the Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything's good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges they have reportedly called "an unforgivable publication of suspicions of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class equivalent to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room where he must have raped her anal according to the filed report in the City Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an off-court agreement because she felt "afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly ashamed".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to reverse the agreement, as she is still deeply influenced by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was facing a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event was supposed to have taken place, and this summer changed to the Italian Grand Club Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily lower production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90 % of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March," said the Managing Director of Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of an exit without agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight schedule, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's production at the Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, said the company.
Clark says that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the European Union is "combined, so that these inspections are precisely avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The opinions of Toyota and other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come back."
One government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says The White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed for a week more", as the verdict on the highest court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House this Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special prosecutor Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his investigation of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's assistants and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to the course of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby risk Mueller's independence has been a gossip in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president via paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would quit.
Instead, a Thursday meeting was scheduled with Trump, who was at that time in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would not prefer to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a coincidence with the Senate hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, were to testify.
Last Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's election.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed for a week with everything going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the TV journalists' game for the gallery, but added: "I don't disagree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting a source, "We've looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health Ministers contact EU staff in the Scottish health service after Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on exit have continued, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased its preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the European Union provide valuable experience and competences that strengthen and improve health care work for the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after main injury
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was acutely operated after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodore, says Tennessee Mike Organ.
First coach for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the incident took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell out there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they put him on a stretcher and took him into further investigation.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "any details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he suffered the damage.
Abercrombie studies in the second year and is starting her first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five strokes on Saturday before he left the game, giving him 18 strokes this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK.
This move should dampen Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK for the benefit of the homeless.
The drawing will be seen as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK. The income from this will be used for the government’s struggle to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee charged above the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent may reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, making prices higher and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot within the housing market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new bill comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap dwellings to solve Britain's "dismal housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching number of housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the removal of the lessor's ability to put people on the streets if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing.
May said: "Last year I said that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life is getting better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it can't be that it's as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as for hardworking British people.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the streets is still far too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become a coach in Scotland"
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become the coach of Scotland.
The 42-year-old shot has the challenge of reviving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a game with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn in me.
But that opportunity would only arise if I succeed in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach for Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success from whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I'll only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being pushed down in the third row and transformed St. Mirren from the threat of downfall to the title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did in his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange, because I did well, made sense and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still the kind of stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I have always wanted to train, and now I do. I have not been more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., shows survey
The heat wave this summer has increased the performance of England’s pubs, but has set restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales at pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales at restaurants fell by 4.8%, showing figures.
Peter Martin, who is a business consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continued the sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup have meant that July follows the June pattern, where the pubs experienced sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages clearly achieved the best and experienced success similar to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages rose by 6.6% for the month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyses the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the outdoor-off-home market, weather and large social or sports events are the main factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt over increasing costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a hard-pressed breathing room."
The total increase in sales for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales figures for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than £9 billion, and they are leading in the field.
Every five children have a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Every five children – up to 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, show research.
A survey of 20,000 students in the 4-9th grade reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has heightened the fear of sexual content
20 % of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents
Every five children up to 11 years set up accounts on the social media they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade and onwards reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram imagery service.
The news has heightened the fear of sexual content being put up.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who urged others to "rape me".
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to have private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is frightening that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the shift as a good opportunity for those who make decisions about sport to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her on board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help to outline a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200- and 400-metre races at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, and who are now often commentator of the BBC, could not go after a transitory ischemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm perfectly healthy, I've learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that milk.
To mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent chest pump", the technological consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real moms dance in a salad that's full of hay, for a song that says, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, this isn't too much, these are my breasts."
"Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my bosom."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," a user wrote.

Another wrote: "Intelligiblely traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added, "What an insensitive advertisement."
A woman admitted that she thought the song was "unbelievable funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breast-feeding made me feel just like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement directed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticises the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind advertising is based on the fact that many women who are breast-feeding say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is completely silent, has no pipes or hoses and fits discreetly in a breast-fed bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, as we showed in an entertaining and recognizable way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Several hundred migrant children secretly moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained has exploded, even though the number of frontier walkers has not changed. This is partly due to a tougher rhetoric and the tougher laws of the Trump administration that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their possibility of staying in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
Return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure criminal records.
"Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households are residing illegally in the country and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In an attempt to deal more quickly with children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to meet in court within one month of their detention.
Many use video calls instead of answering and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those sentenced to stay shall be deported promptly.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, it is said from relief workers and in reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced on larger plants like Tornillo, where size makes it harder to keep an eye on the suffering of a child.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria informs US, French and Turkish "employees" that they must withdraw immediately
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces' stay in the country is illegal and under the pretext of combating terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nearly over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have fled their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have wiped out all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria who primarily train and advise Kurdish and Syrian-Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war - torn country.
In the field of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "breathing unjustified fear" which caused the refugees to disappear.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these repatriations," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Because of the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia was avoided against the province, where three million live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, a source group of Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
The UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for a elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the work of the panel should be limited to "to examine the legislation of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the state court case and scandals close his presidential term in advance, which many liberal viewers might hope for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
There is currently no sign of vision fatigue.
Since 2014, viewers in the best broadcasting time have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcasting time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It's a spectacle that people are attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC-drama Designated Survivor about a leader of the cabinet who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a rate in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
The chaos has entertainment value.
But unlike all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can decide between Roe and Wade whether refugee families can reconcile and the health of the world economy.
Changing the channel is only the most privileged.
And yet it's more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's ostrich jacket for $15,000 ("clad with hybris," wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's vivid descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating crew of the Trump show and daily surprises (squaring with N.F.L., praise to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was to be consulted in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'It's the beginning at the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find their way to the close middle elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives large sums of money.
This recently converted suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps heavily with the 17th.
The cards were converted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully installed in the Republican favor.
The fight for the new 17th District has launched a fight for financial resources between the large party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a election with high guard in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the Republicans' hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but changed its mind
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners threw out Trump's management team.
Foreign Minister officials decided to call U.S. diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to stop recognising Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, Foreign Minister spokeswoman in an announcement earlier this month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million from the United States in 2017 to include drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials organised a summit on security and economic development, which should continue to meet last year, which was seen as a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the thought of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference scheduled for mid-October in order to send a signal on the importance that the Americans attach to the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. agents secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three American officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Knows history
The next obstacle could well be the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, for which there is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also said to address the question of whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If Congress were to come up with new hands, Trump would probably be held responsible while preparing to meet the voters again and, of course, a jury of his fellows in time.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's finality is inevitable – and so are his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the struggle will continue.
In 1938 German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the ejaculation then.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history revolves around, and the irreversible march of democracy approaches or declines.
In the United States there are now several of these turning points.
What if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since the present newspaper announced that he had proposed last year to make hidden recordings of the President and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times' production is imprecise.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is stopped or not carried out properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable for the mid-election?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the crosshairs.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome SK Rapid Vienna on Thursday. After the impressive undecided result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will have great opportunities to move on from Group G of the Europe League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee injury prevented the midwayer Graham Dorrans from getting the season debut before the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Perhaps we could have gone home, but all in all that was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in last match. But with the audience behind us I am sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can go on now, put last season behind us and get successful."
Fear of pension savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a solid idea of how they wanted to be cared for, there were few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationwide’s study reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationswide's life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them about your wishes in good time.
Use your advisor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have money for it.
Get the legal documents sorted out: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Get an authorization so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and health care professionals comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic authority.
In that case, you will appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a tour of the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers describe the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "incidentally random."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami which hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communication routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the government of Donggala, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a county that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
In 2017, the government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster centre, palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called gleaning in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake that measured 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and triggered a tsunami that brought down the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the town of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake that measured 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands out of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regiment in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquake hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son accused of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for preventing domestic violence and for opposing arrest, according to the report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is custody in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought to trial on Saturday, when he declared himself "fully not guilty," reports the network.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations that could lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B violation that could lead to a single day sentence in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under consideration at Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing the notification of a violent crime in the home and of possession of weapons in the affected condition in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after explaining his son’s violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his posting to Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication routes, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the days ahead.
The earthquake hit just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake strikes.
Several hundred people were gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami broke down on the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get the terrorist suspect in NYC sentenced to rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people – a rare punishment that was ultimately sentenced to a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were chiseled down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious personal injury.
According to the legal document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a 22-point charge, including eight charges of murder in gangster activities, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "substantial planning and preparation," said the charges and described Saipov's execution as "extreme, evil and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern district of New York last brought an action in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but ended up being sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was recently imposed in a New York State case in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not show any signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was doing well.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, told the officers.
He has refused to be guilty in the 22 points of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they "probably were disappointed" in the prosecutors' decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the public army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be able to "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
Private Conservative MEP Peter Bone said to the Birmingham demonstration that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge in terms of bringing together the deeply divided party is highlighted by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan on track during attacks by both the Brexites, the Remains and the European Union.
Her ally insists that, despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
To the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrape the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out now," he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added, "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to scrape Chequers."
On the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate to anyone.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the fact that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their mind and would like to remain in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told the journalists: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us elected.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening.'
As a top remark to May, she added, "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the procession that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the resolution of the 2016 vote.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class that is at the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the public army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we are not stopping until we have become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom."
While marching back through Birmingham before a two-timer in the middle of the city.
Scattered activists fanned with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the proliferation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis laughed at the security issues of the Conservative Party app before the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be in control of the IT systems and technology of Canada, of border controls, of free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he said.
"It's quite a joke.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "considers strongly" to stand up for the presidential election
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly to stand up for the presidential elections" after the mid-term elections in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Massachusetts democrat spoke about his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will try in November to re-elect the state's Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Trump Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
They've been wondering if she'd challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the town hall voters, since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to stand up for the presidential election.
Warren replied that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest on gunshot murder on LSU's Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Baton Rouge police reported that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They had released on Friday a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of the injuries," said police chief Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been present, possessing a weapon and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any problems and is now in police custody in East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the lead position, Bottas got off to a good start and was close to relieving Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive in the pit, leaving Hamilton to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes car went into pit a bit later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when, after some wheel contact, the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he led a large part of the race when, in an effort to quickly finish, he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight rounds, so the Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Valtteri did it fantastic all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me by.
The team did an incredible job to secure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At an electoral meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the U.S. Senate's judicial committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "bad and ugly and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Diane Feinstein, was it you who licked it?
Remember her answer... was it you who leaked the document – "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter about Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's election meeting: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the President's continued defence of the nominee judge to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own cause.
"They don't spend any money trying to take power back.
You can see the evil, the abominations, they don't care who they have to drum to gain power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars versus Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made it up to you after Friday's Elite League lost a fight against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants quickly came forward with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownnie equaled home before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team that came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in the Friday match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as victors in the three previous battles.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute of 3:35 an assistant from Kendall McFaul with David Rutherford as his assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants came forward at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard rebalanced with a fine goal at 27:37.
Cownnie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the fight late in the second period, and he won the fifth goal of the team halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four of their five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controllers died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died in order to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers came safely to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a major earthquake on Friday hit Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to ravage the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his place in the floating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his seat to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway, got safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was falling apart.
He died later at the hospital.
According to the Australian ABC News, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death toll can reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness announces that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many corpses in the ruins, and it is not possible to get to them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, who holds a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with several bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water.
All the stores are looted."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we do not know what we are getting to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the clock to perform all the evacuation tasks.
"Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now saying that a man is missing, even though it had previously been announced that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated from the descending plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini states that it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for more information about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had gone to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go in water for life to get to the emergency exits on the descending plane.
He said the crew panicked and yelled and he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working to renovate a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to ship people ashore before the plane sank at about 30 meters depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analysts determine the timeline for the night in which a woman was burned alive
The Public Prosecutor's Office closed its evidence on Saturday during the appeal of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours as an expert in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telecommunications information to tie up the course of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from several different cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was in contradiction with his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police visited Sanford.
Sanford sat in the stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had erased Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later that same day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hiphop trio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in the UK because of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York nanny sues couples for firing with "racist" text messages
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after having been sent a text message by a mistake from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case to "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed his dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEJ, NOT END NOW A SORTH PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice fired and said that their former nanny, as from African-American, had been bad for her work, and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now the plaintiff Giselle Maurice married to get compensation for the firing and compensation for $350 a day in the six months she was supposed to have lived with the family, even if this was agreed without a contract.
"I'd like to show them that you can't afford to do something like that," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have defended themselves that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco compared the case to "expression" and that his wife had born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone like that?
It is not very kind," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still in progress, the People's Court has already written down the couple on social media and shamed their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that readers could not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine being the first to read it before it was released.
It's quite fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small tying bear, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected, and that the 60th year for the publication of the books was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modesty was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, even though it really isn't your profit.
I think a little bit he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Even though it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to a dying daughter over the phone
After the landing her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called at regular intervals to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you around.
The medication she had received to keep her heart going slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now the body shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to really try to get together."
Finally, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sighing women try to stop suicide shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he really felt bad.
In 2014 it was Tyler's 11-year-old brother who found him after he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people there's someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your own thoughts – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis' long-term friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost his girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about being sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
He was really down Christmas Day. When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unsolved while the FBI is starting investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time study – we might get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee "falled from the hind" in the middle of the locked part of the situation.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct their investigation?
Your restraint is due to the timing.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, do not cope well, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to elect to the highest judicial office in the country.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive voice and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean divers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea's Ministry of Merge and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human traffickers contributed to the changed figures.
Pyongyang did not make any official comments.
In time, the vast majority of people who jump out of North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The government of South Korea states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border adjacent to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the hopes of illegal immigrants and not refugees, so that they are often forced to return home.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is still technically at war – has significantly improved over the last few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met to discuss the stranded nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This happens after the June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea on an overall level.
Mr Ri Yong-ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances it is excluded that we will disarm on our own," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit for Supreme Court
The President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated as Supreme Court Judge, "hysterically" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved that way, they would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate judicial committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected the accusations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost cried out and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "grotesque and a coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing who was angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was preoccupied with the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi avoid when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a state court if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say that if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he is sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in the context of Obama's health reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he would re-apply certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, preconceived person must contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just great'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger that's going on, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got a lot of support from a woman who was a boss who said she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she talked to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with an overweight of men, where I often cried out with anger, where I was caught at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss, whom I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're furious.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll be happy to see that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Colorado Congress of Democrats, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and came to the conclusion that she could do just as well herself as a presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was behind with fundraising, so she promised that she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a talk about her not wanting to quit, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
"You could think I had a nervous breakdown," remembers Schroeder, "how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
Thus, the trade war between the United States and China can be an advantage to Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and even though the battle is far from over, the division between the countries can be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, say experts.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing duties on important Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest increase this week in new customs duties affecting goods for a value of USD 200 billion applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has made a return every time, at the latest by imposing customs duties of 5-10% on American goods for USD 60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second largest economy is unlikely to give after just a while.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they are yielding, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it will be far too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the US trade war pressure can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A rapid decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a breeding ground for an economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it is actually much more dangerous than thought," said Abigail Grace, research worker with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to receive refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the refugees to return and asks for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All the circumstances are now present for refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have fled the country since 2011, when the war began.
Another six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that helped support the rebellion.
Europe secures the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 and beat the American team 16,5 - 10,5 in the Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the trophy when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time doing most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at par 3 at 16. Hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the luggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
"I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It's a team effort, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotionally charged Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who fell the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single match Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history on 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistic for one of the best golfers ever who's won 14 big titles, just surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had all weekend problems finding the form with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show, "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we countered Europe.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will move on.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated."
Update on algal bloom: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decreasing algae concentration in parts of Tampa Bay.
