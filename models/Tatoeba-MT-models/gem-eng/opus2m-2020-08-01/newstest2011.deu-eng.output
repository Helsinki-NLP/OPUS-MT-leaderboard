What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditory".
The new leaders of the capital from the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has members of the new council from the ČSSD once a little "knocked off" as they do the notorious snake who has become a citizen in recent years, where today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The codified vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the lost era of Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that these new concepts are falling somewhat into the dark.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a newcomer in Prague's politics," replied Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the "paten vocabulary".
But also the Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"That's the only expression of those you're presenting to me here that I use every now and again."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz this year before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those associated notoriously with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "greatest Prague golf hole", "go into the pastry", "Stiernacken", "treason of the capital" and "bleaching".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take off the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other, I don't judge them."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes," he countered.
As has already been pointed out, in the above headline, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not realize that the speech of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he correctly mentioned in the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding to safety: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And funny: "I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the environmental councillor Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure is to be found and what it means to "go into the pastry".
"I think that means going into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that it was his own vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there does not seem to be any similar civilized snake among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use shorts or nicknames," says the president of Prague ČSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina gives us his nickname.
Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades of the "grandfather" or less friendly of the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made himself aware of the elections by making representations during party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
So nicknames are the only one that allow the Social Democrats to use internal language.
Hulínský does not seem to like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague president.
His nickname "Doctor of the Rubber Knub Right" allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of witches and published a brochure
Women who are stamped witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
If one of these women becomes the witch, it is strictly isolated so that it cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"The situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities is also being spared by young and healthy women as they help and give birth to children."
The local government now decided to take this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason published a brochure to stop the "witch chase".
But it's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, it is also true that witchcraft is being accused of being carried out in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with kerosene and just lit them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil was ignited, which was used for ritual anointings.
And indeed, after the group tried to "repel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of witches supports people here without regard for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "Fearers of human souls are a danger sooner than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of the United Arab Emirates mixed himself quite well.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, triggered a monstrous witch hunt, as they allegedly had a share of their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called Shamane from nearby Guinea for help, accompanied by policemen, soldiers, and the President's bodyguard, who violently abducted women and men from Gazan villages and brought them to the President's farm in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incised people were forced to drink an abscess of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly a thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a map with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the dwellings of his daughters and his son, who is just paying a prison sentence.
All three were increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" precisely the rent.
Instead of 3500 kroner of monthly rent, the son is scheduled for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns next year.
"And there is no running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat it in a simple coal furnace," he taps with his finger on the son's new lease contract, to which he has a mandate.
"But what - I signed," he said half in agreement and half in resignation.
The Bürgervereinung BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not to simply sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish a guide on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other says this," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the new year, this deregulation is ahead of most of the rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay market-oriented rentals.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG Warehousing Room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller to her.
"Miete 2011", a special keyboard on the touchscreen shines.
Briefly tipped and the device spits out a dial.
Hardly did we decipher the number "157" and already peep it on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're on your way.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases are flattening most tenants of the total 44.000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the letterboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client center has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" emerges as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, the Parliamentary Vice President Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD had picked up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that the newspapers today are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They could not even change toilet glasses," the man mentioned earlier made himself air.
Up to now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the desk to convince themselves that they really receive the promised rental discount that promises them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December will also benefit from a half-reduced February rental.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overburdened by demand.
"Of the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals were here in 2011 because of this," the shiftmen estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, both on its websites and on wall panels, where it appears necessary.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new lease, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one is going to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least some reason.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which 5,000 remain for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee's not sure.
"Look at this."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and so wait for the people," she says.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," Pavel Klimeš argues, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund, criticised by the tenants, is the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rentals received, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, some bright red information appears in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means no more than 7.50 CZK per square metre and month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre," argues RPG.
In the case of 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rentals jumpy, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the increase in rent.
The architects saw one - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which studios come a number of well-known Brno buildings, estimated from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building the premises for its company mini-kindergarten.
For the most part, most of his 90 employees are in the Babyboom age and the company is in a position to return to their workplaces as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The architects are so much easier to put under a hat their demanding profession and child care.
The Mini Kindergarten is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The Executive Mini Kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the resources of the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies amounting to CZK 2, 8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment were obtained and for a period of 2 years qualified staff and operations were provided.
After spending the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Mini Kindergarten 3 for further years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are cared for by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day over several children changes.
Kindergarten management is flexible to meet the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of kindergarten - without regard to the corporate hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the Mini Kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are given excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to preschool education, by the way, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What is more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can at any time take a look at the children and thus avoid the stress of late picking up the children from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employer-employee relationships here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, who are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi's interiors
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are cracked fish mules.
This is Casa Batlló from Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house was nicknamed "Knochenhaus" with its organic forms.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splits and mosaics, the reflective facades and omnipresent soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and beings.
Only when we look at it more closely can we see that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night, the whole facade is still plastic, more dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same swinging lines and entangled shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even holes and lashes.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was built by the rebuilding of a house dating back to 1877, which the architect Emilio Sala Cortese performed.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally stood on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló rental house alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the reality and also the use of mosaics on the façade were created on his desk.
However, numerous other artists and sculptors also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was given by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "accommodating house".
It is also said that on the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system with ventilating channels and typical fireplaces for the time being.
It's a bit bizarre that their 45-degree slope is already on.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations at that time and could not be deceived by them at all.
Before the construction began, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit, but the information he made on the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they asked for help.
The Councillors also encountered, among other things, the fact that construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district in question, Josep Batlló submitted a request for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Through the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could chat comfortably, without having to refrain from some intimacy in more confidential conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí's renovation besides a new façade.
Also impressive is Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The play of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made use of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house only decided in the year on this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were maintained, and they were extended to other common and attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price to visit the building monument is not a paparazzi, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist licenses get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers should try to make friends with one of the home dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the deck - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously supplemented to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and, not least, the sex of the sleeper.
The interior, in which mattress and rust have to be placed, is equally important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house, which is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to "be warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough venting ducts at the core and are still on a solid plate, moisture becomes visible: hence, it is not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will have difficulty getting used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Well all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they could no longer sleep properly here."
"For their washed shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these also to people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That's why I've gotten these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) from many hockey players years ago, but also from other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works very easily.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, or else it is actually applied to the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection from dekubitus (moon fire).
When choosing the size of the mattress you should still add the length of the soles to the height of the body, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of sunbed width available, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example single beds, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal width of the bed: "If you are lying on your back, there should be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and space equipment, who has been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and who also presents this topic in specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are also the same.
Otherwise, nothing is left but to mount the rust at different heights and that is far from possible with each bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the mould layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or when you sit down, you can't feel the feathers," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Entirely padded beds with mattress and floor like adult Siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the connection cannot be washed, which is already going and giving today.
And since one night one loses between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and congested) sieve after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in mattresses, even lifelong guarantee.
Every thing has you if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress guard, which you can easily remove and wash.
Even if mattress covers are usually made with a round zip closure today, so that two halves are obtained after the opening (essentially important for the washing process and the washing size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (unless there are any inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket springs and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable lattice rusts with 14 to 18 spring strips (lammels) and always pay for rust with a larger number of lattice bars, i.e. from 28 and more spring bars, with lattice support in the lumbar spine area and the possibility to regulate the lattice hardness.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletons on adjustable lamellas, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the rigidity of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they allow the punctual insinuation of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
The women are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion springing are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, thereby reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow for the right mattress and right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here too a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm pillow, as the Scandinavians, for example, like it.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their blends.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum oils, they are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soya oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called in mattresses, whose core consists of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender dust while sleeping.
Here too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While men use a "cooling" plant extract made of birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the references for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red pepper shoots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm while sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Matrates made of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathable as commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates more zones-matrates that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to cover.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT rates, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to benefit from this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not that easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with a tangled visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
You get the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur becomes soft with warmth, in a cool environment it strengthens itself again.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for other health products, such as for special foot pads intended to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people monitoring devices to control the kids
The fear of your own children is growing, and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, originally invented for the search for cars, can as well place people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently as the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it may not be bigger than a watch.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička in fear and terror and thus keep them looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example if you put it in your pocket without knowing it, but we had no such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out, however, that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, he simply loses himself.
"Very small children too show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"Even the mobile phones at first aroused great expectations among the parents, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Bočková.
In their view, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"When abductions are planned, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with which it could be located."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would be accompanied safely by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services both for automobiles and for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the data subject is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tiltometer is integrated, i.e. when you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, one needs only to record a special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that it is either about devices in string box sizes that resemble trailers or about smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are being tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to know at all that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he only notices after a while what gives the police a time advantage," he adds.
No matter which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle placement.
So the combination of tracking function with the GPS system (genauso as with the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole Czech Republic around you but only two years.
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of ignition cords, which are ignited with blasts.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of lead to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cord - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from the company STV Group, i.e. for lipstick 40 million crowns.
In his explanatory statement for the purchase of this huge quantity of ignition line, the general staff of MF DNES replied that the soldiers would use the 60 kilometers of ignition line annually.
According to the research of army pyrologists, which MF DNES referred to, it is clear from this statement that every year the entire army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and General of the Army Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be partly justified.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this too would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of every new professional soldier, two meters of ignition is sufficient, then the army has created a calming supply for the 225 years already mentioned - even from the point of view of increasing the needs of the pioneer and special units.
Recently, soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade complained to Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no longer had cartridges for hand firearms, so that the shooting exercises of the missing funds were severely restricted.
Not to mention underpants.
"I don't understand why they're buying such innumerable fuses from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, whom we as dealers want to meet as far as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is justifying the purchase of a hundred kilometers of ignition line with the fact that the army would have been so covered up for at least ten years with this "muniition".
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of operation of the ignition cord and police and army pyrologists only two years old.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain nameless in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the period of use, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition line.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's 244 kilometers," says spokesperson Pejšek to inform us of the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
For comparison only: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics by the police, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherly Army, has exceeded almost 1,500 metres for some years.
And the police always order only such quantities of ammunition that they can consume before the end of their life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore reliable ignition cords is also left open.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who spoke to MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces are expecting the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses, which they have so "favourably bought" today.
To this day I have come to the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotel's franchise.
Lukáš Pytloun was the winner of the last year of the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition.
The story of his success is like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank credit, he created a buildable house with five apartments.
Given that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four guest houses in Liberec in just seven years, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the 4-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another top-notch hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the Pytloun hotels franchise have already signed up," says entrepreneur number one of last year.
"Great share of this license sale for operating hotels had just won in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the Year", adds Mr. Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame, yes popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that it did really well," he remembers.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he takes advantage of the contacts and acquaintances to which it would not otherwise have come.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also a bit down on each of his employees.
And there he is to the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I really don't just see this as a personal success, no, that's the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little bit in the foreground," Lukaš Pytloun says modestly.
My successors I wish for a quieter year when we had it in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first place of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year last year was received by Karel Ž­árský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury acknowledged the efforts he made in small tool construction in Česká Skalice to knock a company out of the ground, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered a small workshop for rent to his father Karel Ž­árský as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, had his career in the company in which he was employed until then, suspending and setting up his own company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization has it also entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
"Not only do our customers now notice the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to appreciate the fact that they can work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Ž­árský.
The last year, however, at Farmet was not only a sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part in 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of machine tools.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less citizens, but above all companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"We couldn't escape this situation, of course."
"Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take on redundancies," says Karel Ž­árský.
A viable company sometimes needs to take such unpopular measures.
However, it succeeded in getting the situation under control and keeping the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make cuts - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž­árský.
Everything bears witness to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
Revenues are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a great deal of joy - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel Ž­árský.
An opinion poll that clears up with absurd rules
The opinion poll on the "Absurdity of the Year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneurship competition.
Some crazy rules have already succeeded in getting out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next year of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online was advanced.
In this way, more than a third of not all four thousand voting entrepreneurs chose to vote.
Thus, the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have obtained it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register in future checks on social security contributions," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the rules and regulations, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the senseless.
This year, for the fourth time, this is part of an entrepreneurial competition organised by the German Economic Journal (HN) and is enjoying a growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder business activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders in the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, with an increase of eight places compared to the previous year.
The competition absurdity of the year was first announced in the year and takes place each year after the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the closing of the competition at the end of September.
To register, the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organizer of the competition is looking for seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and has the public vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It defeats the absurdity that most voices get.
For this year's opinion poll, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have been notified.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, also provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at the Prague Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November is part of a happening in which people of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and businessmen of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the businessmen between their legs, there can't be any real economic upturn, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily complicate entrepreneurs' businesses," said Martin Kokourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create unwise orders from the world are effective.
In 2007, the majority of the people were disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report three days in advance to the commercial official on the site of their permanent establishment the intention to travel with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or church.
This obligation has been abolished by a amendment to the Commercial Act.
The obligation given to the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report missions of employees up to 30 days to the Employment Office - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, refrigerator and two scales in the speech room was adopted.
This regulation has been somewhat alleviated by the Ministry of Health this year - the cooling obligation has fallen.
A new category honors socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new feature in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Economic Newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair businesses.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their business activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile company Vodafon, the promoter and guarantor of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company announced companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and provides enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as they are about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for 17 years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-impaired employees, who account for 70 percent of their employees, for whom they were awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia" and in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year they took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won the victory, which, among other things, introduced a running and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours a week, without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is in turn based on the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, as well as promoting home work for its employees and using cartering services offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the region of Karlovy Vary is also worth mentioning, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to meals, to the working path, to increase their qualifications and to holidays," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The category of responsible company of the year was automatically notified to all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were therefore not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public procurement
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly tried to manipulate a recent public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the contest fell to a specific interested party.
He's supposed to have paid Luboš G. for half a million.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person in a public competition because of the crime of fraud," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor's Office of the Právo newspaper, who could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in the light of the scarce official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá pointed out the question of Právo in this respect that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not one of our employees," she explained.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct term "call for tender for land transfer claims under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer, in the context of the invitation, a higher value of their refund rights to be compensated by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokesperson.
Luboš G. was obviously at the disposal of information about who had filed for the request and since he was himself a legitimate person, having bought himself a number of refund claims, he offered to a property interest that he withdrawed from the competition.
Obviously against a fat deposit.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Bodenfonds, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement refunds for which site decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. from the Land Fund also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, in the place where the construction of the access magistral to the Borské pole business area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the Magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the properties.
At the time, the town hall had to give a heavy heart to the building project, so as not to endanger it by blocking the properties.
Households' housing costs rise by some hundreds per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges and rents will also grow for district heating and some places.
From January onwards, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more from the wallet each month than before.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities one will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places also cost the district heating supplies.
Only electricity costs the housing budgets a few hundred more crowns a year.
High electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, there are several hundred crowns to be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Above all, larger places are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner a month for district heating, more than 1000 kroner a year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are facing 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges should increase by 7.4 percent.
Enormous price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation lapses from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Who does not agree with this increase in rent, the company wants to take a judicial interest.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fart, Rum and Vodka, exceptionally a good whisky that was stolen from the house bar by the father.
These are the drinks for which the Czech teens who are drunk need to be treated most frequently under fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head doctor of the Children's Department at the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if the father manages to dispose of a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least distance or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with juice, so he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief physician.
The spokesperson of Motol Eva Jurinová's Faculty Hospital gives him the right.
"Most often it's about remote or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Slibowitz, which is taken from home, was also the subject of a single affair," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in the hospitalization.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatric ward of the hospital Motol, where the rescue cars delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was first delivered with 3.5 per million alcohol in the blood and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief physician.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in starting with their own sproutlings is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependence on children in the true sense of the word.
"A long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena is to be understood by alcoholism, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital's spokesperson, Ms. Jurinová, by mid-November, about forty drunk children were assigned to the local Department of Pediatrics and Youth Medicine.
However, only the cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospitalisation are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by their parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children drink only one bottle of snaps in the school bench, there are, in the opinion of Mr Pelikán, three seasonal amplitudes, to which 100% leave: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow for the bad testimony or out of joy for the holidays."
"On the Walpurgisnacht, I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, sometimes ruining the patient's good mood by counting the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by car and the night in an emergency bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used this as a means of education, when I directly calculated the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it can happen that they have to work all over the holidays to earn the money for one single fete," added Dr Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the necessary costs from parents to heal the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that this type of machine is owned by a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only shown at maneuvers or airshows.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
When she physically expedates the planes from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The L-159 single-seat fighter aircraft were, in turn, isolated from long-term aircraft, without any further deposits and investment from the Ministry's resort.
"The double-seated L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to succeed without two-seat fighters, as the Ministry of Defence signed a 200-million agreement on the conversion of four redundant L-159 to a two-seat version in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to deploy the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty states clearly that EADS is the customer of aircraft L-159 and that it is to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's business in which way he realises the matter," Pejšek pointed out.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The trade of five L-159 against a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not issued a tender procedure for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The Office of Defence at that time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which she only used 24 and the rest wanted to sell them.
Incidentally, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a legal follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice for the reason that the aircraft should have been selected on the basis of a European tender, and not by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last one is scheduled to land at the airport Kbely within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than a ring finger reduces the risk of cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is particularly true in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as family health stress, added Mrs Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3000 healthy men.
With more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand index finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty-seven even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is precisely accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that he knew this study fleetingly, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to be "fully proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walking paths is mostly snowy, the winter shifters were in many places all night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed for some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
Novinky.CZ said this was the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometers 91 a truck crashed, at kilometers 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road tomb.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks have collapsed.
The drivers should leave behind Brno at km 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at km 182 at the town of Kývalka.
There are miles of traffic jams.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 and it has also occurred at the time of arrival in Prague.
In Prague itself lies a several centimeters thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in the Prosek district, also the Štěrboholská street is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is certainly the metro.
The trams travel with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven fast trains due to snow events.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should be informed of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday at 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the streets in South Moravia can only be navigated with increased caution.
In order to Vyškov, three side roads are completely unpaved, in the vicinity of Brno snowfalls are sometimes formed and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There, three streets are still completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too you will have to use snow milling.
When they become re-travelable, it is not possible to estimate.
In the Hodonín region, caution is called for in the field of white carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert sprays for reasons of nature conservation, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK pointed out.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimetres, mostly in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimetres.
In the Moravian-Silesian region up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops snowing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the force relationship to their favors.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting safety of only a few meters.
The special calibre of 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing high-explosive explosives, works practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the impact on the target, but at any point in their ballistic flight path.
That is, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or a trench.
From above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audet, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he inspects the target and sends out a laser beam, which determines the distance, he wins an exact sighting point, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only has to print.
"Let's say they measured 543 meters."
"When you press, the gun charges and shoots the gun at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs being shifted
The Fujitsu Group moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplaces from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specialized in computers and their maintenance announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplaces from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that in the medium term there should be a further 100 additional jobs in the Group, which had been distributed to the region so far.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large offices in the Astro Park would be better suited to the employees' working methods.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport was particularly important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezenent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was again a "global player".
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu passed to the city that the settlement was an important impulse for the Niederrad.
Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
In the end, economic reasons would have given rise to the conclusion.
Now it is about preventing a long emptiness in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building shows themselves cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the Town Hall Square and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt with the remaining buildings at Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the railway station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Kancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consumers native to Tokyo are known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The Rhein-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are counted in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary in Frankfurt-Niederrad is to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped layout - the central association of electrical engineering and electronics, among other things, has its seat.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Against Assange
Wikileaks are becoming increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange allegedly stops in England.
The revelation platform Wikileaks is increasingly under fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's searchlists, is supposed to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks pushed away by Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the country of the open air", the disclosure activists informed Twitter via short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic depecs in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks further explained: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon had stopped the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had commissioned research, the TV station CNN reported calling on Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Security threatened Amazon with a boycott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to also prevent the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers life around the globe," said a announcement by the partyless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks spread stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the authorities in Sweden for suspected rape, is on Interpol's search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden an intrusion of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is justifiably afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures be charged and executed for betrayal.
In Canada an adviser from Head of Government Stephen Harper - apparently ironically - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a change of heart.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "stupid and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she is responsible for recent espionage calls to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The US government is now testing comprehensively the protection of its databases.
As a special representative, Russell Travers, the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism, announced the White House.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that could have been required by Wikileaks following the publication of the message reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government shares and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced its intention to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they should be put at risk by the Wikileaks release.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice scouts are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest in attendance and visitors from around the world.
Where does the whole ice cream come from?
From the Gelataio and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little old-fashioned of the ice-skonditor, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making.
The Gelataio picks up the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spatula, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream doesn't get past the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Leatieri has the largest in attendance and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the on-site ice cream parlour.
Some dream of a new career in the Midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of her own after years in a nerve - exciting job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive thing is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano forgets in his training but also the cream hat of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step towards manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano rolls the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns up a cock on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice creams.
The teacher is immediately bewailed with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural fabrics without a stabiliser?
How can you free up your own desire to experiment?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarre flour from the guarbehne.
Of course you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it will sink into itself, and the customer bites on loud ice cream.
Certain variations on the ground mass are permitted.
It gets more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment also involves fruit ice varieties.
More flavors, more fruit puree - tasteless is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice makes the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly enhances the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Eicing is a calculation task: If peach purée is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemonois.
Luciano draws out a device by which he determines the sugar content of the fruits (wines thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables facilitate the calculation.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical use as before.
Not only the device for automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all the automation, small foreheads do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo complains to his fellow students from top to bottom with fruit puree, when the overdimensional stick mixer is out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like that happens."
On-the-fly controllers
The European Food Authority, EFSA, was underpinned by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now making this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert have been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid by corporations like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has cooperated decisively with the EFSA testing regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The EFSA regulations were word-by-word with Ilsi's position papers, thus drawing the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Testbiotech lacked a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-level EFSA manager was recently without any obligations or transition time to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed human resources links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians very sensitive.
However, the EFSA cannot identify a conflict of interest.
The opinion refers to all the serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality.
Experts working for EFSA do not require that they have no contacts with industry.
But they would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This is called itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this case, independent experts such as Thenn criticise that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any animal feeding attempt and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize is doing on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not produce reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how do you find them?", asks the accuser.
That's how Angelika Hilbeck sees it.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zürich.
Industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the USA.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not linked with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would not normally be published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about which, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood form Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: thousands of cigarettes demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, most of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He made sure he got some of the cakes.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He swears: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he sacked one, he smelled like cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the crumbs yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stones leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who fell off at the crash in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame for them to be ground or left in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden pool that was once a watchhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he told when he was in the newspapers in September that he had bought the rest of the North Wing from the abort contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it happened, then it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos of quadres on average, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck loads.
About half of them still camp in the forest, the rest of them have long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, house builders.
They had come from all over the place and had dragged away what the trunk and the trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the instigation have long since turned into "Mäerle" or into restrictions on herb beet.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his off-road car, makes a tour through his 20-hectare empire.
Jura studied and resigned, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
It's braked.
In the snow are artificially cut sandstones.
"They once belonged to Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstone, yellow, warm, it's swarmed.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe train station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertine."
Once, the quads were part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion's grandstand.
All over the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police presidium, red granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were earlier cut by hand and moved with simple bottled trains and oxcarres, he becomes very venerable.
"It'd be a scandal if you were to walk away."
He didn't become rich, he wasn't rich at all.
But 14 people are busy with the stone dealer today, as well as having settled up in the forest of Steinmetze, a sculptor, a forge, a glass blower and a gardener.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the reseller.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to save.
Talent battle for high potentials
There's a government crowd at the buffet.
16 students insisted on salmon bread, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of Ideas Competition, together with VW developers, they are supposed to experience the car of the future – and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the smartest minds, many companies now go into the close-up fight and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the auditoriums before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish essays on the performance of their students, one tries to explore and bind the extraordinary talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group advertises the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, Selle, are not unusual.
New is the fact that students are being so offensively bullied.
"Otherwise, the focus was on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must be commended and, above all, bald for highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
For KPMG's auditing and consulting company, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern carpentry hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can view KPMG facilities and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to go with it decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When the high potentials at the universities are hounded and pierced, the guns are getting bigger and bigger according to Dykta.
"We want to get out of the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be on the table.
"We are still in contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just before their graduation and want to apply soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bumping on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go on the pirsch at professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Somewhere on the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young people's problems.
Currently, 35 jobs are advertised on the company website.
"It is very difficult to occupy vacant positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that we can do internships or write their diploma thesis."
Expensive advertising campaigns are not popular with solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to promote with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large group often cannot offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money does not play the leading role in job search anymore.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for getting up are other crucial factors.
Solarworld won 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, it questions how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe also hopes that the jobseekers will also receive positive points from the placement.
"I think applicants look especially at external assessments of a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to more authenticity.
And that, according to warriors, means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, the internal employer is called branding, i.e. employer branding within one's own workforce.
"Congratulated employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise for their employer on their own.
"It's like a game with gangs," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the next few years off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
A ban of this kind has been imposed by the government in Washington - and thus definitively withdrawing its previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for now.
Minister of the Interior Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the deepwater horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the accident that killed eleven workers and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been finally cleared up.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy group BP, which is faced with billions of claims.
A committee of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop that had been imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been subject to numerous accusations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama announced closing lucrative tax loops for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the volume of support in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than it has been before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be postponed to a further extent - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of oil spilled out have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't bother," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You will still get enough oil sludge from the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to light a boy wading to the chest in the water with the veils surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene seems almost beautiful.
It is not to be seen that brown oil swans hover under the surface.
She used to pick up shrimp here, Esther Badom tells of the Bodo-Jetty River on the shore.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, from a brushed pipe, bulky crude oil poured into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours in order to get into fishy waters: The Ogoniland located in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the world's worst-fucked regions.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps passed by rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat builds up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black licorice rods from the ground, sadly leaving single palm trees to find their way.
Bird swarms, as they are usual in wetlands, are sought in vain: As soon as the outboarder is silent, spun out in the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dunk: "We live in constant danger of health."
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield fought for decades: the first explorers from Europe came here more than 60 years ago, where, in the 1980s, the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa organized the first resistance, where the Shell Group had to cease production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still refusing to return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire Delta region from the triple size of Switzerland with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable is the situation for the company.
All few hundred meters tall steel frames like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian Trees" are called the heads of drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Again and again such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been poured into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil, as it went to the sea 21 years before Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the continuing eco-GAU is being challenged.
While the shell group Sabotage and the organized oil theft account for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main cause.
Shell imposes much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner proposed to the Group in 2008: Only the rate of defects on the lines was "a much higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-lubricated workshop under the open sky, appear from the mangrove shapes: they are split naked and lubricated to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected to pipes, partly randomly scattered on the premises, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates the tap through the pipes, then drips out at the end of the kerosene line and finally, diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 litres a day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The price of diesel, which is ridiculously low at just under 40 euro cents per litre, can still be lowered by the illegal cooks: because their raw material is free of charge.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts in the whole Niger delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost daily.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share fills organised criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, in tankers and scaffolding them on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more due to the movements of the population or the salmon mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refining."
Meanwhile, Ogoni's relationship with Shell in particular was so destroyed that only a deduction from the Group would be in question: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese appear to be better."
That's where Michael gets nervous.
"The time has come for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they do not threaten to be arrested, but a painful lubricating money.
The soldiers who come from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Errors in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of an emergency-landed machine that could lead to a "catalytic engine failure".
The Qintas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus had apparently known much more happiness than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 engines - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigue cracks and leaks, it was stated in an opinion published on this Thursday by the ATSB Authority.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Rolls-Royce produced engines in 20 aircraft in the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a complaint at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline would claim damages for the incident in early November.
At the engine fire, parts had been dissolved and the load areas were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines need to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they would perform further safety tests on the Superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the forced landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight snow fell almost all over the country.
There are chaos, trains and flights on many roads.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At freezing temperatures almost the whole Republic is snowing on Thursday at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east are some 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in constant use, but was not finished with the constantly rejuvenating snow.
In addition, there were heavy waves sweeping over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) is waiting on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, snowfalls on motorways and highways caused considerable problems.
According to the Meteomedia Weather Center, alarm level was violet in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused dislocation.
There were several trucks and cars left in the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to increased traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and bends are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescue workers with woollen blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds sweep the streets.
At large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
According to a spokesperson of the Flight Information Center, a number of cancellations have already been reported in Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesperson, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service is in constant use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
On many roads accidents occurred on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The locomotive driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle was still stuck.
The driver died.
On the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after crossing the road with her car at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will be swirling up at light waves.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by rapid and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - local up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house buyers are looking for the two office towers at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
Only recently did Deutsche Bank make its headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt bank district have been modernised; in the meantime, the banks were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" writes under appeal to a spokesman.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the proposed sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution is thus relocating its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of a domestic fund and then refurbished them in an elaborate manner.
The energy conversion increased the data by around EUR 200 million.
I think a sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers of the paper, now renamed "Greentowers", is estimated at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open at present, said the speaker.
Thousands of Mournings About Dead Mushrooms
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still the bodies could not be saved because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
About two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies could not be saved so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a commemorative celebration.
Ten thousand people had gathered at radiant sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed on which helmets, lamps and the names of the fellows could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags waved on a half mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was thrown into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin had also been shed.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were displaced, they began to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn lotet with his fighter-epos "Walhalla Rising" new old genre limits.
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and, with almost superhuman forces, rows around his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and rips his enemies' intestines out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film over no word, and also the other figures can be torn to pieces at most to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and swelled in the creepy hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the Viking world the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinemas with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It's nice if a film has multiple target groups, only if it's mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humour or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred from the squirming brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when, for free-interpretable reasons, an eye breaks with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem, and an eternity is stuck in flatness and fog before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema is hidden that deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict action, it's all about the atmosphere, a film-making fever room.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and entangles him with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly, but above all with the unfathomable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who stands by the eyes faithfully, preserves himself something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior out of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to anger, excitement and amaze.
An experience.
Enigmatic earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Agency has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country resists to take a stand - it still allows for controls.
Towards midnight of September 5th, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quad, hidden in a valley that descends from the current.
According to a letter from the CIA of late April 2008, the reactor known as the nearby village of el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is scarce.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unexplained satellite images.
By computer animation, she dazzled where what components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been stopped shortly before commissioning, said it had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, there is little more known than then, and the puzzles have become much bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but hardly saw evidence that there was "an active nuclear program" in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a "supposed reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as do the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in summer, which IAEA had "sufficient material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly managed to save the alleged "unused military building", they planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium produced by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers via a Member State from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings cannot be obtained on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always meant never to run a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, after analysis of the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as has the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses to control officers a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Premier Ehud Olmert, who is in office at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been inconclusive since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons barrier contract in the area over which the IAEA is watching.
As a key to progress in information, the IAEA apparently sees three other institutions that are to be "functionally connected" with the presumed reactor - and unlike this one still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not revealed which facilities are, or what function they have or what they might appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and has located a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely on this ground, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three locations.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the USA to spy out military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectors had become aware of the institutions through a tip of the U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the square on the Euphrates material has been transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it, there are at least plausible assumptions on these key questions.
It is also unclear whether debris, which could store valuable traces, was stored in three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has investigated in 1998 as a storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, photographs from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - only the effort shows the great interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna complained a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter had not been very urgent, for example U.S. ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Viennese nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
Although IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and on the other hand, some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but alert to an escalation.
On the other hand, how to think of a diplomat: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
The script itself has written it, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for anxiety.
Persistently, the rumor, the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested immediately, and some of the film days planned in Sarajevo have been transferred to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female Victims of War wrote about the UN refugee aid facility UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie herself is ambassador of the UN Refugee Aid.
It is not diplomatic - it has offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to her organization, the UN Refugee Aid Agency has recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has granted a film license for Sarajevo after a while - it's not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author himself suggests that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis is taught about the film on the web, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew themselves in it before the outbreak of war and met again, when they, a Bosnian Muslim, were dragged into a Serbian camp where he worked as a guard.
What sounds a lot different than the "victims of rape" variant.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, was "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by putting the screenplay, like so many before, into the Internet illegally.
Nothing like this.
That evening, it finally runs around for the Irish again.
No sign of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheered for joy with loud music, they stamped with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in South Irish Cork trembles because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro win prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restraining computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan does not include playing fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application discussions in New Zealand in January.
"I have a hunch," he says.
"It's so far away from home and yet I don't have any work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerk, got her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, and his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
Hundreds of Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, predicting experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, a wave of emigration is comparable to that in which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the upswing that brought with it great prosperity for the Irish, Tristesse is spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly worrying about the young, well-trained Irish people, for whom it has only gone uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are many reader letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the stream in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please, turns off the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future coming up because the government only operates wiping eyes and offers young people no longer prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She is watching her fellow students swing from an unpaid internship to the next one.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers all-round service on working abroad.
"For professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website show photos surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they're just pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His home country now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a bit and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept courtyards, in the entrances parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent financed credit.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer doesn't like the lamentation he hears a lot at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is by far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe this makes us feel like an Irishman."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who has gone to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just look at how life goes somewhere else.
A couple of years of work in London, he's already behind him, and why shouldn't it go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still worrying about him these days: the celebration for his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could end up in a charity party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Sorry, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a going party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democrat Routine
The movement of democracy in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The results of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy supporters rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
This trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. That is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a marked increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined its efforts for more democracy.
This continued even during the world economic crisis, possibly because Latin America's countries experienced only a short recession and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught up in a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey do many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country a greater problem than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: around 71% of respondents over-regionally indicated that the private sector is indispensable for development, with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalised many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
An Eclipse
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral assistants who rushed to help the affected country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes, ballots in Rinnstein, destroyed polls and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless through the January earthquake, roamed around in search of an option.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, called for the abolition of election results on the grounds of alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, called the choice "as pretty good in many respects".
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly obliged to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected pick-up is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial appeal for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no agreement with the voters, explains that he is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by lack of organisation.
Some 250,000 IDs required for the election were not yet issued shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves share the same opinion.
Secret in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%. That's the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help this to be re-elected next year depends on whether Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's choice, guided economic policy, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue the additional revenue at his own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further breakdowns.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is at present 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main goals, not the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Population, INDEC, which then made up official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And official statements say wage increases should be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined the growth momentum by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps Cristina Fernández would like to join the rest of the world financially again for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had refused the country's earlier debt conversion in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as elsewhere.
Last month, however, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical support" for the creation of a new national consumer price index, which would appear to be the first step towards cleaning the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after her term has ended without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which largely has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentineans return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been met will be severed.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to silence and silence many of her husband's political decisions.
Soft applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the edge of the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters were elected, which is 70% of all voters, to elect mayors and city councils in the five districts. This is considered a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of the relationship with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China's mother country for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) holds three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence from Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city streets together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with Krawallmachers, flag-driving mass parades and only poorly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, spoke on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man shot into his face out of the multitude, Lien was wounded, and a man who was about to see him was killed.
Bizarre referees are not clear if the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and put the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more voices.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationship with the mainland was not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
This time, however, the DPP also avoided exorcising the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of bringing Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It is more likely to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he stood for absolute independence.
However, under Tais Regentschaft, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai was a Presidential candidate for the DPP, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything possible to show that she too is able to establish close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea forge as a contact point between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes non-biased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas speedy approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the Pragmatician Su to refrain from the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever more plentiful between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only strongly in favour of re-approaching.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no return".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was overwhelmingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the category Newcomer of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released no more than three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known in the general public.
Their ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes next as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings in 2003.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was also nominated in the category Instrumental Albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Among the competitors Iyers include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rare favourite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ of the Wild Steampunk Musician Darcy James Argue received much-deserved attention in the category of Big Group. He thus joins the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octett, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices is listed, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and premiered in 2009 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Dougherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Part for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appasionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on 4 January by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is entitled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumental solo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestra performance for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Accuratex and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins approval from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious center is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"Wonderful people live in this valley."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides being fairly evenly distributed according to the press enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no America anymore," said a comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is over."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmush called for nonviolence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully for years in Riverside County. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, about 2,300 m2 mosque in Mediterranean style should have two minarettes and be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the 17500 m2 property on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbes could enable new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterium that can live among others from arsenic opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that a life is possible without the elements considered necessary to date.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake in California grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"What else is possible?" said the co-author of Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread Internet speculation that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily specified," said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes, which are both exposed, may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is mainly due to chemical behaviour similar to that of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it almost all lubricates," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life-form can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which the arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has not been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early years of the earth, she says, therefore science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and National Health.
Other stolen dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when the unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is, the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make precise information about the location of the dogs nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still under way."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're tracking some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs at a district animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were uninjured according to the official statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were present on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace was to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer cub, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-skinned Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's reward to anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis. Microchips were implanted for identification to the animals.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's salary would be paid.
The lion roars again after the MGM restructuring has been approved by the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officiated the "preliminary" glaucoma plan to cancel the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to open the way for new movies and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way of anything. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat sealed studio as the main manager.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings in $75 million, manages the company. The financing is due to stand by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management who fought with interest payments of $300 million per year to solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Dougnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial problems and to pay the more than 140 clubs of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything started from the beginning when the MGM team started the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly for the management of the company, received a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to resume production at MGM. This year the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films for "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be created by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can tear a considerable hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a whale mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys with their own website appear, on the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, there is a broader range.
There are more and more button cells-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plush figures, as large as guinea pigs who sing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several singing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you started with the press once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (fisher price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays like 'Simon says', and thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel-blocking, it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphe, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can make a car ride into a lesson, with a better wiper with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is still Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a string box and have its own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised literal competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops on your own, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2's Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
These can be roller-shoes or a puffle duster.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of claws.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subordinates and gave orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary razzies and their propensity to violence - to impress the viewers.
"Standing straight!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are!"
Four girls, hardly growing up in their teens, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white striped loops.
"For me, they look on average," says Mr. Tang of little appreciation.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: According to reports in 2009, 50 officials circled a poorly positioned snack truck and stared at the operator until he packed it in after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police districts. They have been selected specifically because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the poor image the Chinese have of these city councils.
Rightly, the critics say.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the Hubei Province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone as they made a protest against a garbage hold.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injury after a handful of five officials.
A video game of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily announced last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The paper demanded a "real thorough cleaning".
skeptics believe that the current approach is clearly inadequate.
When the district was looking for eight female recruits by display in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to a job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with a good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity of women over 25 is too strenuous physically.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district official at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that they have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District City Administration, does not wish to agree to this description,
But admitted that in China sizes in job ads for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is like good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical deformities do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or bucklings here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple trays and a well-formed mouth.
She doesn't feel like a sexist, that it is so important to her appearance.
"Find out, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic glance.
Your colleague with the dikes, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short-term attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to scare traffickers through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or bike before they are driven away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so many times!" explains Ms. Xu, a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous than strenuous.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales free time.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of dealers, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public adversities that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of Kunming's inhabitants, the capital of Yunnan Province, were ransacked after the rumor had been trained, and Chenguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officers were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were killed or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared such outrages so far.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which had been repaired in a workshop instead of in a garage contrary to the rules on the sidewalk.
The owner yelled at Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officials, with a fierce face, made their way to their vehicles and drove on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, remained behind, turning his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Prosecutor won't accuse Senator Ensign.
Senator John Ensign has been acquitted by the accusations made against him after his affair with a former electoral officer and his attempt to provide her husband with a lobbying activity, the Senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided headlines throughout the country and gave his career a damper, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "enjoyed" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been stopped and that no further charges were made in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign has disobeyed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were released for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his estuaries, gave rise to lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during Ensign's election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work. According to the documents and interrogations he took over for them after Hampton’s lobbying was set up.
Since Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, was contrary to the so-called prohibition of turning-door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be all about an agreement and the violation of the turn-door states," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the direction of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethicsmen said that the ministry seemed very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for failure by the prosecutor.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrific," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and governmental circles in the United States), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign before the courts.
"In principle, this means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from an attorney on Monday and another day, in which he was told that the ministry will not bring any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defenseman had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate appeal by the Ethics Group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons had violated the Federal Electoral Act.
The Electoral Commission said that there had not been enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, which for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 proves that, after Mr. Hampton's company moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was "knocking" about a matter at the Ministry of the Interior.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents for the first time last year and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was ranked fourth in the Republican order.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was looking for a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigation, his press spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Ministry of Justice very quickly and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call makes Twitter aware
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the Krawalls in the courtroom.
In minutes, they sent their reports on cruel witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judge's verdict on the jury's death sentence falls.
However, Mr. Haye's attorneys have already filed applications with the court that explain the reasons for an appeal and that the courts will deal with for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that, through intensive reporting on the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - it has come to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of stirring detail, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public disarmament.
This objection could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies would require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe it is a real danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Chief Defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, rejected the applications by decision briefly and succinctly last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that certainly was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that reporting on famous-infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States lifted the sentence against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film "On the Run" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court appeals, which Mr. Hayes' convictions consider half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's fall.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that limiting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who explain Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced already when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel crime pictures during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her husband, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with horror.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor's office, and that he would have exerted undue pressure on the judgment when he had made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a conviction they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continually rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day crowd of media pipsers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "had not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more pervasive than reports that are being reported more slowly is a counter-technical point of view that is hampering reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorney reinforces this claim.
In her statement of objection, she referred to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the New Media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divorcing?
After a campaign of chimpanzees and negativity, this week little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the head of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough in the major issues with which one had to deal during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were made.
After all that one hears, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a party point collection.
The President's public meeting on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate the members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation had begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called for, while one tries to balance the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or servitude, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election in Washington has been mild for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections generate partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats hardly have a choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, whether temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, even if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferential tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse support for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and also ratify the New START contract.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Insituation warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of inconsistency is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today to 2012, as a forerunner, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were useful in their formation.
However concerned the Republican leaders may be that they are too high to poker, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and put health reform out of action.
These party lines are already made clear in the first reactions to the Commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, and the raising of retirement age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Vice-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own opinion, have insisted so much on putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight a lot to get even close to that number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republican Obama challenges with regard to the state budget, the taxes and the health system, later followed by a phase of major bipartite cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is sentenced to loss will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partyism and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress-Republicans than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, much more effort will be needed on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate the two.
Drained U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Kleptokratie" and it passes on to the Kremlin part of the bribery and the protection money it collects. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are blackmailing high levels of protection so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority" - takes its share of the money that the leaders migrate up.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturine, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in polls.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individuals are called, and it is unheard of that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection between the government of Moscow and crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and to the conclusion that the government acts like a kleptokrat rather than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as much in demand as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself very modestly is none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business closed up very quickly - due to one or another excuse.
Medvedev has talked about fighting corruption several times, but at the same time he has noticed that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Indemnifies, nationally, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked number 154 in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed as "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which occurred after the late evening of Moscow, will certainly trigger miscarriages within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and angryly responded to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a poorly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and winding walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to have public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells children of former soldiers the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time.
And in July, a U.N. and Cambodia community tribunal first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration difficult in Cambodia.
"There is still disapproval and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During Khmer Rouge’s rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to pass to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not surrendered, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elitist officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to trial.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether there will be any further action beyond these four cases.
This has contributed little to alleviating the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years, who had been in power during the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s district manager in Manteay Meanchey Province.
In 2007, she had told the documentary center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening in Chaem from work on the fields came back to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the weary grass, the Chaem refused to discuss her past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court were to charge them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, here would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, even though experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that everything can be understood."
The Centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often happens in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are judged by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path covered with a rusty sheet roof leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with shrubs overgrown with plastic waste.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street side, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will put down a bush of ripe bananas, hoping he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect any further weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide, the Belarus Government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had for years tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But the U.S. government official told the Washington Post that over the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached to remove 187 pounds of weapons-capable uranium from a Belarusian research institution.
This prepared the stage for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which Belarus had ruled out.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make any dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the Uranian Belarus in October was particularly complicated, because the material was lightly irradiated, say official.
It was loaded into a special train that more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say official.
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the official.
The US government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-relenting Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-bearing uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcomeing the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government to CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not object to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners across the Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as indicated by a U.S. Ambassador's telegram in Madrid.
This reflects the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that the former Deputy Head of Government María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish Government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft that fly over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe accusing the aid of human rights abuses in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council's report "Meeted Zapatero Absent" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed" in order not to be "unpreparedly surprised", reports Aguirre via cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as it was in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González, in turn, gave the message that he would not request the judicial initiative to block the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "appearing coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle governments discreetly," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, during which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were madly concerned about their independence and did what they considered appropriate," he had given his employees instructions "to avoid inflating rhetorical comments in order to let the tension falter."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the US government will have tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, but that even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the US government," he emphasises.
The child killer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "trouble" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monaica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she introduces from a small age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least a friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications date from 2008.
In order to understand this, one must know her love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from her family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she lost her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-husband never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Cesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news it can be concluded that their love relationship broke down and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone at Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him this, he found it good, but now, of course, he notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself at work on the 20th if I don't want to lose them."
She explains she's taking her firstborn with her when everything's okay.
"He will be with the one he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother", a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place likes him a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. See, if he wants to, he'll find me, such a shit."
On the 30th, another: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from it.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer."
"Terror a la bilega (title)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, explains that he has a bit of a conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monanica was transferred from the centre of the Menorca Prison to Palma Province yesterday.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of harming the little."
Before, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his body in a suitcase.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on parliamentary elections - preferring or not - and their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this number was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On last Sunday, the PPC scored 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voting rights and the binding of the PP's electorate - were to continue, PP's analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional members, while CiU 4 (it now has 10) would win and the PSC would lose at least 9 MEPs (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - currently has three - while ICV would hold or win one.
However, should the electoral calendar be retained, the next date will be with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to bring an end to socialist domination, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists will neither reach a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council, in which it would have to win 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its votes in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turn. There they ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Ängel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party has also seen a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 Catalonian urban administrations and strives to create lists in as many locations as possible.
The Catalan cell got Al Qaida thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven policemen arrested by the Barcelona police station and the Nigerians formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Movement to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter author of the Bombay assassinations, which demanded 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with the "operation Kampai" the counterfeiting machine of Al Qaida has been "weaked" worldwide and "somite their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida is composed, so that its "combatants" could freely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only disci-hadist network active in Europe, so other European police units have been involved in the investigation, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, and it cannot be excluded that in the area of the EU there will be similar attacks in the next few days like those carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested and the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbumming.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell located in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show any visa stamps.
Investigation circles stress that until now no links have been established between the arrests in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack of Catalonia by means of a money transfer company several thousand dollars had been sent, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated an extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to delay the tax agreement
The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present his conditions of personal support for his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already presented during the electoral campaign and can be summarized by the priority of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party addressed her with the certainty of Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 members she had won last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to make herself feel indispensable. For the candidate of the CIU's bourgeois-regionalist party depends on at least one of the opposition parties being present in the vote at his place of office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to enter Congress in the coming parliamentary elections depend on a possible duck with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As far as the party presidents of the PPC are concerned, the party calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and that the party leader of CiU even wishes to submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders are in common that they want to make the established political apparatus of the regional administration slimmer and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's entry into office are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Old Home in Olot do not rule out that their caregivers killed over eleven older people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference in which they found out what damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the caregiver who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - had done to the institution.
Joan Sala, the head of the nursing home, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, in court and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths), but "the right and our liability force us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss of prestige because it had not detected the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high sum of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had killed ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The leader of La Caritat denied this point roundly and stated that "missing measures could not have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat's attorney added that "there were no indications in the dispute of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The already baptized "Death Angel" confessed to eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed an overdose of insulin, unlike the first one in which he had administered a mixture of different tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that access of staff to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail were used by the caregiver in six out of nine crimes committed to relieve patients of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them bleach, as he confessed to have done to three women who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the statements of the caregiver, not even in the number of confessed murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his course of action suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say that they made themselves available for this reason and in order to clarify the scope of these incidents of justice.
European Central Bank (ECB) threat shields
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capabilities."
The risk increases of the euro-peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be deceived and that the euro has hardly been able to address issues that cause concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, after which the ECB will have to make a withdrawal tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, and for all exceptional temporary liquidity measures to be abolished. Only one week of permanent access should be maintained.
According to the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and quarterly calls for tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the bond purchase program will continue and a strengthening signal will be issued.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if stubbornly insisted on our withdrawal of our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As at the ECB’s May session, in which the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt and then collapse the markets, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot to provoke a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management only spent 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets in the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland's debt hole were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not realizing the problem of the July stress tests, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has shaped her discourse on the summits of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There, political unity is needed to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's ninth symphony.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our reindebtedness.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed indefinitely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now it is not just being, it is also the appearance."
Only courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen challenges Vega Sicilia’s shareholders’ meeting
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not wave.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate grumbling, will challenge the shareholders' assembly of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - the owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not seem to be prepared to give up control of El Enebro’s organs in his dispute.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened for the 16th anniversary by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the family Álvarez.
The appointment of the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - in order to acknowledge, by means of legal intrigues, fraudulent acts and abuses, the meeting declared null and void of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the opposition of the assembly in retrospect in order to declare it "absolutely void".
In June, the same protagonists who were hiding in discreet silence tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting on a judicial basis.
With El Enebro - Asset Company and Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing to deal with the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon by Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history in this exquisite universe has been marked by surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last season, all put on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso in the final track last November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
True reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industry department, explains that with the use of this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements found on the races and during the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 ten technicians worked in the racing booths on average, which were able to make no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Red Bull's team employs 180 highly qualified young people today. With high-performance computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing cars.
Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are being changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality from the virtual reality of the simulator within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend in one season for its races.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a place 50 km from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer places in the services of its participation in the racetracks are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The plant's technologist, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that the progress in the field of R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of twenty-store sales network with 80 to 100 square metres each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned the rebuilt store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out Madrid being the next target.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of shop opening is always the same. They rely on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American Group advises on this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of shop personnel.
Helena Herrero said it was not about a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive sales point network was intended to "optimize the customer service and advice of small and micro-enterprises when purchasing and afterwards, even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers to 'claw'
The managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the war on debt.
Nevertheless, it foresees a break in interest rates which banks try to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000 if you remove the customers who will lose the bank - that is the great challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the banks' plans around the world.
Sabadell will conclude its Optima roadmap this year, set four years ago, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will decline, the risk increases that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as compensation for the dwindling profit margins, will already be passed on to the price of loans.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will exert pressure on the loans."
"We haven't turned the cock off, but the interest differentials are very high," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to limit long-term loans and increase interest differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the state of affairs to "increase fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell's roadmap is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate transactions.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "enormously rising" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will fall into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market with captivating increases.
After ensuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he defys the argument of some banks that are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasises that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the events in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo transactions and thus stem the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of savings banks
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks did not have to participate in the first phase. They stopped the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkasse Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather as adjustments."
"Most of it is finished. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seven, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta stated that "there would be a series of unanswered opinions about the slowness of the process, the indifference and insanity," because "Banco de España urges us to close in time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" throughout the world and added that those who doubted it did so "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need to "don't worry" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had successfully passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, regulation of temporary workers or the abolition of the EUR 426 support for unemployed persons who do not receive unemployment benefit, as well as the privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the head of government, who had outwitted the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It was anticipated that Merkel's position was not an error in her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, we are beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German Mark - although it currently sounds more like Science Fiction - supports most of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals. That means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the rules; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries as well as the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has stood out for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government withdrew a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the dissociation between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At that time this was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue from Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel comes up with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to be rescued while at the same time requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has driven the Irish crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, albeit somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It says to everyone that - although unpopular measures must be taken now - the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the countries in question will be severely penalised, forced to declare themselves incapacitated and, in this case, to take over part of the costs of the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a strong growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do a bad thing not to understand.
It is not just a matter of reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will be more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared his way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change about it.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should not exclude from the euro area that is fully packed with few serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and regulatory environment
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The alleged exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 game against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether or not it was an unportal act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will comply with the prescribed penalty at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules, but followed in this sport.
Part of the debate on the case presented is that a team of the Real Madrid football club (who in his hymn pretends to be noble and honoured and who on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether the conduct which is not expressly prohibited by the Statutes contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a regulatory circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to bypass its sense.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, for it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid any unfair advantage from the opposing team on the part of the gamblers. This did not happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false play or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the penalty joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the offenders draw from the intentional fouls.
It should be pointed out here that the rival was neither brought into a more unfavourable position nor gained benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that its own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage obviously is that the players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term, up to a certain degree, uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually leave as well. Moreover, with this approach, the players receive a penalty and go over to the second card cycle in which they leave with a card for card accumulation less than in the first cycle.
It is therefore not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with the penalty (it would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they preferred to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing from a punishment.
Although the border between invention and the regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of inventive step.
I have the impression that the polemics were created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the kind of provoked transmission of rules.
The damage caused by these actions to the principles of sport is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offer offensive for customer catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
This year the dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations to days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the pre-Christmas season that carry oxygen to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure industry. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture also the customer segment, which represents the great mass: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirm the respondents and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of 13 December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinners to two top players (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pockets.
Whatever the economic situation, the lowest prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barceloneta Festival, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it ten times before booking."
"They like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer the quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices of 25 euros are most in demand.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Group, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 localities, optimism is not lost after the revenue has flourished again since the second quarter and good, although also focused on a few days, is faced with prospects for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than a price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts sprout, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are in the upswing again.
From the sides of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the bar, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are overall quite "living", although the customers "put out a maximum".
The fun of celebrating, however, did not go down, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing great concern in the USA
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Disclosures by Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by Wikileaks Internet portal, confirms the enormous concern of the Washington nuclear programme.
On the margins of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened but, on the contrary, "reduces" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are identified by the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and rocket programs is no longer seen by the United States alone, but also by Russia as an extreme reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan has to recruit strictly believing personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit persons involved in nuclear or rocket programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New on the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that the cooperation between the US and Pakistan is failing in terms of nuclear proliferation and the increased speed in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" explains: "There is often no transparency; there are no answers to help offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, a government secret service official for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clear up" the responsible person that "Pakistan's army has ceased its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a high leader for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issued a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" about Assange's "invention and persecution".
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the USA, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks' founder Mark Stephens assures, "the police would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
At the request of Sweden, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order on 20th, but was not notified until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had obtained the authority.
The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange "to arrest and deliver him temporarily."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states, according to the organization's statements, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is probably staying.
Assange's lawyer, who yesterday published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was compared with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, who received the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is charged with in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is pleading for the innocence of her son - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday he gave an interview to the head of Time per Skype magazine from an indefinite place. During the conversation he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "stupid and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama herself has commissioned a high leader in the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange stands in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chairing the National Security Committee of the House of Deputies as of January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations "to seize their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to say that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was that made information slip through in the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and everything that is not execution is too mild a punishment," he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink of eyes to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal uprising in the ranks of the paperless ERC after the loss of 11 MEPs and half of the voters.
The party chairperson is aware that his withdrawal threat is not enough for the next of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
That's why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a wink of eyes, which would secure his position up to the next municipal elections.
Yesterday, it was announced that the more than 200 regional members of the ERC could make a secret statement about his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a fine to the president, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without mentioning percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod's closest calls for more from the president than only the party to provide its office. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top organ of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to speed up resignations, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now on to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to take part in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will be able to put to the vote of the Council on 18 June.
Their intention is to pay for Puigcercós. In return, he is promised to present to the Congress in autumn 2011 what the party leader already thinks is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various objectives".
He listed five of them, two of whom are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that this represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a way of functioning.
He is thus fighting for a reform of the statutes, which should allow the congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercós's team, already fighting for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the termination of the assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 Assembly, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal rest of the last few years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors being on the verge, the time could have come for this matter to be reopened and closed forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to MILENIO, four cases were recorded in México in less than 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, according to MILENIO México's censuses, that is four fewer than in the previous month.

In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the waste water canal of the town of Playa Golondrina.
The emergency service was looking for the rest of the body, but it did not find it.
Residents of Tepotzotlán informed of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the area of Peña Colorada. Hands were tied to the back and the head was connected.
The man had a wound that came from the shot of a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month it was reported that two men were murdered, encased in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle set off on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two murder threats were found.
One day later, in a cardboard box, a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes settlement in the village of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the Ixtapaluca municipality and the next morning in Huixquilucan, the body of a man, wrapped in a yellow-blue ceiling, probably named Mario Ríos according to the news his murderers left next to him.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla by Ixtapaluca the lifeless body of a woman was found with shots of firearms in the neck.
On the woman's skin tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as chains with corresponding pictures have been discovered.
In the last half of the month in the municipality of Zinacantepec the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle.
Two days later the bodies of two men, whose heads were covered with tape, and a message was discovered in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Compared to the body, there was probably a message signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't join."
In Ecatepec, two hands and feet were found with traces of torture inside a taxi located behind the San Agustín Judicial Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first one had been bought in the village of Cuchilla Ancón and tied in black plastic bags, besides there was a message. The second one had been tortured and was found in the streets of the settlement of Juárez in a plastic bag.
Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
China's representative stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to convert its industry.
He explained that over the last four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this matter.
He stated that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress had been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the targets for reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the authorities of the States had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he explained that several years of plans have already been undertaken or concluded, both those financed by the Chinese government and those received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
There is also a project on climate change at the provincial level, another on the exchange of traditional light bulbs by energy saving bulbs and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than would be generally accepted.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China accounted for six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 per cent in the last five years and is expected to continue by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party chairperson had the right to contact the National Commission of Order and to ask what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos had been excluded on the right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to contact the National Commission of Order and to ask for the right to do so.
In an interview held before Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espino's exclusion was a decision taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case for a decision to be taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4th and 5th of December, when his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or chairman, who would need the Acción Nacional for the next three years. Therefore, he gave the staff "to those whom the Council would determine."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to delegate to each of the five the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's upswing in the last elections of July 4 would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry flags and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of demands."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the course of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet," he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could make expressions like those he could in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral ban and even less censorship.
Obama advocates Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act Act - law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act law, then call your senators and press for the adoption of this law," said Obama.
His brief announcement contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to come into contact with their senators, as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - Law and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Inquired about the blockade of Republicans under the Dream Act Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be drawn up for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the process of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the Democratic Majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, which would allow the initiative for legalization of undocumented students to be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who have emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, who have lived in that country for the last five years and who have been enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the defenders of the law need sixty votes in order to adopt the initiative, which is why they depend on the voices of a handful of Republicans. At present, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
That is why the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other democrats should decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Most of the Republicans in the Republic include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your fingers in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble", the Argentinean writing spun sweetly at the audience, which consisted mainly of young people gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, at which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio and then identified the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of whom she does not receive an answer, but clues for the guide to her story.
The infector leaves her convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the traumatologists, who took her breath in the middle of the passage, and who tell her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst conceals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the story sighs eased and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an adorable story, which he called 'the praise of the invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With references to magical realism, he tells of a famous magician who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turnaround and reported about America, the great novel, which it did not lack from the beginning to its own chroniclers, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even got away with shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the crazies and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have inherited from him what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the row, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted their contribution to the great wound of the social violence that affects their country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggle for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after stressing that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-living world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness on dogmatism are also running out, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a small yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean putting our fingers into the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also harassing those who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited a sense of writing to be rediscovered.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end game also contrasts with two different styles, specified by their respective trainers, and their contrasted encounters are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinean took the medal to the second champion, he stayed one step behind the winners, and surprisingly he played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist achieved the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand with which he suffered a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to put a setback again, as the 2-2 game against Los Choriceros went undecided after 210 minutes of play, but at the 11 meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to plug in his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by misfortune and freed himself from the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection that I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," said the tax collector when asked about the lost end games.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assured him that he learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to leave with two eleven meters, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by eleven-meter shooting doesn't bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleven-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the fierce desire to hold the title already in our hands, which left us something for this final game, and we hope it won't come this time."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just second champion and to taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves to the service bodies for visa applications prior to their conversation with the consulate, and costs will be reduced accordingly.
As from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the Embassy of the United States and in consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application service bodies (ASC, the initial letters in English) prior to their consultation in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of handling the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the opposite is 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visas do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there for less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will affect the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which caused speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it can exist in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures. It was the hypothesis that if their living conditions improved, they could turn into intelligent beings, like humans.
Apparently it is a microbe found at the base of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all possible life forms, since the lake is highly arsenic-containing.
In any way, the microbe uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances of having similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere may increase.
According to astrobiologists, when these organisms metabolize the arsenic, it has been shown that "it is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the actual reach of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference is attended by the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) on the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system was introduced, they complained.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already an opposition block was installed, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two party system' into the chamber.
Prior to the launch of the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were betting against the reform of the organ law as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, co-ordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau chaired by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political edge with these reforms.
He argued that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they assumed their political will and if they did not have it, they would again be wronged by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after being monopolistic, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that an eternal two-party system should prevail in Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five MEPs and they talk to other colleagues to make them more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to PAN and PRI, said that the Congress had now turned into a 'bait' for two.
"Previously it was only one party, now they split up into two."
Mr Montalvo requested that the Members be respected and given their place at the negotiating table.
"The five, which are currently seen as being divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 peso more for "the supplier"
The City Administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check over just over 200 000 peso in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check, issued on an amount of 200.144,56 peso, was issued with the number 9258447 last November for the purpose of "billing open invoices".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money would go from the community to these suppliers. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and as a result the number of cheques still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it just pays the debts, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24th, October 15th, October 19th, October 29th and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as this is required by law if a company is challenged by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste had published on 25 July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had already paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also shops with Jumapam where they collected checks worth over 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the break-in of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas in poor condition and to throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Union, recalled that there were various opportunities to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and walking paths had had a negative effect, as the tourists would come to snuggle and see the disorder, and then they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist's downfall had brought to the attention of the city's lack of prevention and maintenance.
"The community must assume its responsibility and avoid doing this again. How it should do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We are longing to have a clean city, because not only because it is a tourism area, it must be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy in order to maintain the city in a good state."
"There are other places that also look unhealthy and unprepared," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product needs to be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly on fire," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents are merely what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently required."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Sub-Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and caused a bad image to arise.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore with the city. To make the city clean, neat and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first have to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to provide them with the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for Congress results
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take on the great responsibility of setting a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy parliament, free from agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the Congress of States are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partyism and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur Co-ordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with whom they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival comparsers of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We care that they carry out a trustworthy work and work for society and its groups above all, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them during the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary priority to the Ministry of Tourism in the public budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second most limited resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Seeking Holy King
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family longing.
For parents, it will be difficult to meet these wishes on the next three-king day, because the household is no longer composed of 12 persons and a goat's goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in their mouths, because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes hard times are called because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go with the gores to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or bike while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted a 'monster car' for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana proposes clothes of the size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I answered him, 'let's wait, boy, because it was very expensive', Cayetana remembered sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The size of the eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is 12 years; the ten-year-old Isaías is 10 years old, while the eight-year-old Miguel is 8 years old.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can take part in the campaign 'Holy King Is Wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 Suspicious Drug Dealers Arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region were carried out in the context of the collapse of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, in places that should have served mainly in the manufacture of drugs.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom came from Sherbrooke as the main wiredriver of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared hours after their arrest in front of the Sherbrooke Judicial Building.
They could, among other things, accuse the production of cannabis whose property is for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation carried out over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be pursued
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be put to the fore after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly lean against this Charter."
"I hold with a party that has put a shackle at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session had ended in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows each person identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because he opposed the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government does," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration question, NDP, has dismissed the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough against the secret immigrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take measures against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to enforce by means of another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because he is looking for the blame for the refugees and is holding children captive for at least one year," said Chow.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the Canadian's will.
"The Canadians strongly inform Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts affecting Canada, which treat the country like a footman."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," said Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a Conservative has said to the agency QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MEP can immediately explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Party of Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public security as "an enchanted rabbit" as well as "a well-established solution at a table end".
In turn, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he was pleased to confirm.
"You're aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, a lecturer for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (State University of Education of High Administrative Officers).
To get out of this dead end, he proposes to Quebec to grant financial control a special mandate so that they can carry out investigations related to corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the audit mandate," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same powers as commissioners to audit, which would also allow her to oblige people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the government Charest.
Quebec will also demand Ottawa to amend the penal code in order to better adapt to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed his colleague from Justice, Rob Nicholson, who is currently dealing with certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorbike police, 131 persons were arrested, although the penal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several river runs remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall which has occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening another landslide took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has sunk into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains from 40 to 70 millilitres have fallen on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 additional millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had gone down here.
As these rainfalls are to be added to the snow melt that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec Security Service about the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the region of Lanaudiere.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and remain under observation.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe rainfall has taken over some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildar and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte an evasive bridge was torn away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security continues to remain alert and monitor the situation as closely as possible, according to Security Council Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Center issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Duplicated in part
The Quebec radio moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial comments on social welfare and Haitians, as well as because of his outrageous speech about radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their views, but certain statements "would have contained inaccurate information about the social welfare and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unsavory speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was made following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activists' organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderators should provide solid as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont held that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" in question would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not defrauded of his person.
The last issue was the statements that had been made about the earthquake in Haiti.
In this regard, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media debate that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared not to have donated in favour of Haiti's aid, since one would not know for sure whether the needy would really receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already paid off my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board encourages the spread of an unbridled expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted "outside its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was to notify its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within three days, among other things, are minor.
A King of the Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a native of the Algerian country of Montreal, took a very special course.
The athlete, who is brilliant in "Sanda" (full contact with Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and into the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as kung fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight of all places, since for those who do not like to present the ground struggle, like the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee had given his rivals bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs held in Edinburgh, Scotland between October 23 and 30.
"I won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"Those fighters from each category had been invited who had placed themselves among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I babe in Toronto in 2009 to get a bronze."
"2005 I became in Vietnam Achter."
"In 2007, I finished the fifth place tournament in China while I became a third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fiststrokes and footsteps are permitted as well as earthworms.
The two battles usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most prestigious boxing fighter from this type of martial arts is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept back only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," said the sympathetic pounder.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semifinals of his category (80kg) before he lost in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four contestants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finale of their category."
"Then the victors of each category offer their foreheads to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu."
450 million in contracts without a tender
Hydro-Québec has approved 450 million dollars of contracts for the Eastmain 1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project in mutual agreement with project planning companies.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, at a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called the "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a follow-up to the decision of Hydro-Québec to give the private sector its responsibility to discharge this important hydroelectric project of a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium reopened the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois Party, recourse to business consortia is a serious ethical problem which raises the risk of distortion of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and devastates competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games in secret, they are now conducted in an open form," said Mr Sylvain Simard, PQ MEP, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Minister of Resource Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by saying vehemently that this contract had been about a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, "by strengthening that the PQ had acted "unreasonably" and that it was "missing her hard".
She said it "say the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance which allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is in progress and is expected to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is subject to government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, of which there are several dozen, leads back to the same legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying particular attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose of the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will speed up."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you that you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte said.
This contract, approved by the "Énergie gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted over 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in Energie Gerance.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total at $449 783 344 including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that formed the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally associated with the companies they "funded" before she specified that it was rather their managers.
Barometer Consultant consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the branded brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Shame, although it bathes in a media-efficient universe, where it is only shivering from information in favor of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake on its commitment, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to have little credit to pay to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admit that, in fact, they have no faith in the environmental commitment of companies as much as in green corporate advertising, the measuring instrument developed by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke betrays.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates attached to supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important for the stimulation of this consumer segment, which is currently alive by nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious character of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebec's declared performance of green products and services, which they are trying to provide, is untrustworthy of.
According to another Communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their neighborhood and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, who tries to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental awareness seems to hold in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The addition and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichés.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to return to its real cinematic function, apparently does not receive what they have requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a loan at a lower level than initially expected, which could bring about a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least according to the sources that can be removed from the state-owned incense.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected since the summarily down again.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who manages the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he sent her a final report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to them.
In any case, the premise of the donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec-owned community of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by making the argument that the cult minister had no financial support for real estate projects there that he had not allowed other cinema halls to come.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema for over ten years, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, which could justify the exception on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of theaters showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clientele at the bar.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the forefront, in turn, direct a private-funded campaign of which they hope to raise the purchase by $700,000.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three theaters on February 27th next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not remove the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group consider to be from the bottom-corrected proposals they made.
Secret of the complex shaked Canada ventilated
The new American diplomats, who were spread by WikiLeaks, gave the secret to what the United Nations considered to be the American under the inferiority complex of the Canadians, but with the same blow they exposed the latter feeling of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have the sense of Canadian-American relations in the election process, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were published in public yesterday, offer even more pebbly details than the mere substantial content to be tangled on.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on which point the United Nations no longer participates in the efforts discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"One of the Canadians' almost inherent inferiority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to speak much more about internal issues of everyday life than the United States in this election to push the black Peter (as in 1988 at the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "noisy silence" all the less, since the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
" Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has as a key factor in the sense of urnification."
The other expression of this sense of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, a business owner in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, which President Barack Obama is expected to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's continued existence at the beginning of February's vote of confidence on the federal budget, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has resulted from a revitalization programme of between 30 and 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
He had not mentioned that the government had had to delay the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another announcement, dated January 2008, by Ambassador Wilkins, agrees with Washington that the increasingly negative picture spreads through CBC, dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also abductions for the purpose of hearings conducted by the CIA.
Another communication describes in detail how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed out to the Secretary of State a paper in muncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to read the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds about the WikiLeaks website are warming up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN has proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction to be achieved in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations on the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in terms of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFCs emitted to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-hot pears, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the large exhaust emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global emissions of CFCs from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance sheet, however, 5 Gt would still have to be subtracted to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In the white glowing pears 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact light bulbs reduce energy consumption by 75%, while the new LED light bulbs reduce this energy demand by twice as much.
The compact light bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that Philips has put on the market this week - this company has, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot pear, which indicates the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that its completely novel light bulbs give off very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore they need to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-hot pears.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the benefits that each country would derive from this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year in the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is excited to announce the results of the elections
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "unforeseen" publication of the results of the presidential election of the Ivory Coast immediately after its term.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to maintain its work and to publish the preliminary results without further delay," stressed a UN Chief Press Officer.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, to expire three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CEI President had confirmed on television that the Commission would "go ahead with work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have become loud, and the CEI may at last call out the name of the winner of the second round under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraudy" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Head of the Presidency's campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, had confirmed that the UN's manoeuvre to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters from going to the elections.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who disagrees with any connection with the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand victory.
His allies reaffirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results as he knew he had lost; and file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results were illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible in the event of possible outbursts.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), according to the preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolitan area and 9.7% involving the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million French metropolis workers were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% including the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolises (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France in total.
After an examination of his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office (Bundesamt Insee) has not published monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining social assets, miscarriage of general goods, heathing, involvement in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to speak to him on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading brain pins."
"It is easy to imagine a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialiste) in the department, had placed the importance of giving the judge a memorandum of justification before his hearing by means of his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keep his estate, which he had to manage, running.
According to Simon, he would never have known about the area of business competence or the target location of the associated fund.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also accused of subversion and accompliceship on Wednesday, but then set free under judicial supervision of the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were charged to him."
"The chief prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedomů, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four more persons had been charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole disposal company (MPM), is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two civil servants of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one of them being arrested because of the title "Responsiveness and Infidelity of General Goods by a Public Service Agent", the other because of "participation in the Infidelity of Public Money".
The companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and subjugation of social wealth".
The people who were confronted with Guérini belong to Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public acts that had affected Corsica.
The flags suspected his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the waste management sector, was carried out in April 2009 following anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, as well as on waste from the Aubagne area as well as on certain cities in the Marseille (MPM) urban catchment area.
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its middle position for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy in alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents preserved by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on dealing with their own crisis of "terrorism" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not lead to the release of Majid Kakavand, a French-held Iranian who had been detained and executed by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a bright light the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde rice.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything in their power to bring back their own nationals who were being violently detained in Iran.
"Much noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without omission" the words "basic human rights", "indebtedness", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Purse this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "silence does not solve anything", past the attempts to discuss inconspicuously, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "common Iranian tactic": "Spirying for the purpose of political extortion".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates further hostage captures, a phenomenon that "will sharpen."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from custody by a judge in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American Embassy questions this worrying coincidence.
For Washington, following the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian from that of the French?
On the occasion of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to oppose it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "harder" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, re-registers, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranians "were currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to believe by means of announcements and media-organized "flight attempts", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities".
Based on so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons which led the Elysée to lapse this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyses.
A policy was launched in 2008 and was perceived "by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved".
"The Syrian role is building up" in Paris "to show Syria what a commitment you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow cross-trafficking between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier had entrusted her with this: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have ever done anything".
"But we thanked them for everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our fellow countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Cinderella", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight, by blocking their access, as indicated by government officials.
A draft law to encourage online game operators to deny access to these games to young people under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, reported representatives of cult and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties in learning at school and also in living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the French press agency Agence France Presse's minister responsible for this draft law.
The online games are then available again from 6 a.m. on.
The producer companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he explained.
The government is also looking into asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit granted for access to these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the controller added.
It will also provide those who wish to have free programs that allow us to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the host country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the World Cup organizers 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threatens to push technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's kingly discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (catar Australia) for itself in 2010 after the premiere on the African continent, or continue to pursue its branch in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political commitment of a world championship.
So the things behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to run the World Championship once, in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given the nutrition floor again by broadcasting a documentary report that has been launched by three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English authorities, who were primarily engaged in intense lobbying with David Cameron during these last weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess move by his predecessor Tony Blair, who achieved the 2012 London Olympics organization in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in trumps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal raise Russia's chances of becoming a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (states, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unscrupulous indication of the allegations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You throw it at dirt, you try to compromise it," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First world economic power, home of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidates seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA-like approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which allows the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, for certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (due to the shift in time), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: openness
De Gaulle had really taken advantage of it.
Midside had made him think he was bumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious side of the mystery that holds the presidency function is not well on the face.
So you have to act as if the doubt persisted.
On the one hand, as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's followers claimed that a third mandate was not excluded, without even believing in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy seriously assured him to make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011.
The fact that on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP Parliamentaries he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" had thus spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely pointed out that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't think I won't think about the stage after that."
His words of yesterday make him no longer a candidate than the day before, but no less.
Should they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the opening of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, which many members of the PS early on exhort than accepted for battle.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, the right-wing voters would prefer a candidate of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the poll of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it with the UMP," responded immediately and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin reports.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled down with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of sovereign debt
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis or at least to announce a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to come to an end at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt to do without doubt afford to bring about the present, more than tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to exacerbate their deterioration.
Political costs would be far too high.
The French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed yesterday at a press conference the ECB's active role in resolving European sovereign debt.
It has not dared to say whether it considers that the central bank can do more, for example by stimulating its programme of buying government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the day before in Brussels, had not been very well informed about his projects at the hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, but rather was pleased to note that the programme of buying state papers on the secondary market would be "promoting" and that we will see at the meeting on Thursday "the outcome of the decisions".
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest historical level since May 2009.
In practice, last week, the bonds purchases of the Treasury were doubled from the ECB to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, she was said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
Overall, since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up to the purchase price is by no means called into question (see page 29).
The economists do not expect a remarkable change in the rate.
If the bond operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's Arsenal, the latter will continue to create unlimited reserve assets in an open-ended manner, over a period of up to three months.
The economists are already concerned that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially change its programme".
"Otherwise, she would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, Economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions on the sovereign debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that would boost the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the rapid enthusiasm for the yields paid to the weakest states," testified yesterday to an important bond holder.
If interest rates were to be raised, the States would be even more hindered from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government covers Italy
After a week of concern to Italy, yesterday the situation with the decline in interest rates to 10 years was a little relaxed.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for Economic Affairs, regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "incalculable" and had heard him expect a "unforeseeable" weekend, which the person demented immediately.
On Tuesday, at any rate, the German interest rate scissors would have reached their record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk would have increased to 263 points, which had resulted in some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "heavily concerned" about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In the clearest sense, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax revenues that threaten the state to no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate is expected to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will remain at 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to the 3.9%) and 3.5% predicted by governments in 2012 (rather than 2.7%).
That is why the uproar for a new budget collective, which, after the holidays, could be spent at a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures need to be taken," says Auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are settled and we have been repeating this for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is demanding lower stabilisation advances than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with a motion of censure by the Chamber of Deputies, which could have been organised by the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period ahead for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde pointed it out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it has been proved on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency territory."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, there can be no mention of the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly affecting banking systems," says the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, since "the political time passes much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both this gap and the danger it presents, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and in a wider sense with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
This also applies to Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan outlines the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
With regard to the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for this.
The first on-the-spot expenditure of the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the agency Reuters had been entrusted with this, and the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilised by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the first countries, are sending themselves to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms which will be added to the austerity measures, but which will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at all costs to avoid having to seek international assistance before they have set up their own budgetary corrections and decided on essential structural reforms that will bring them back confidence in the long term.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, had first developed the idea that if the 750 billions mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to intervene again in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European sovereign debt at the forefront, judge that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism is currently 60 billion euros.
An advisory board, which has every chance of being examined carefully in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are concentrated.
Snow and Glatteis: 24 Departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Alarm Level Orange due to the threatening risk of snow and glatte.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in the Orange alarm stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two since Wednesday afternoon, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes graze the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow coverings of 2 to 5 cm are expected, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as from 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic congestion and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "calls on drivers to take full care of the streets and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Paris Airport on Thursday and 10% of their flights from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in southern London and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, they recalled the 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the start of the SGP's construction, the state has declared a capital injection of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to give in the markets part of the financial sum at its double.
Today, it has finally come to first high accounts.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly's Financial Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of this money.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
The figure is: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate tax system: "to modernise it in order to increase the product resulting from it and to pass on this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not mentioned in the text.
Of the 4 billion, you're far away.
"It is argued that the tax resources will be added to the EUR 4 billion of capital invested by the State and the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be provided for the project," the explanatory statement can be found.
The SGP does not find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projectation for over three years and then create only from the 4 billion," is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted".
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions will still be able to be sought for a long time, is in danger of creating a properly motivated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Harmony Hacker and Emsy Spione
The Affair WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, giving a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's follow the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (an x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The "extraordinary", American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw away nothing more than what one read for months on end in every x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifying caricatured profile of Gaddafis has provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret files may only consist of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will see that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rose Crossers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not the only reason why the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (yet he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be anything, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy had sent to the State Department in Rome, was the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a lifting about the revelations of these dossiers made?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take an airplane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigation films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the mission of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-any hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "shrimps" in distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, one could combine all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be completely correct since then, where one can control any movement thanks to the telephone, any transaction made, the visited hotel, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one is faced with what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's ruler - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free from mystery, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks to disclose that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this infliction on such a powerful power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future - that would be an outhang attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that it is futile with current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to imagine the government agents moving in secret on uncontrollable routes, carrying their messages with them nowhere but in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the shoe market.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, Watergate's spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today technology is progressing like cancer, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogues) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape for tape by being able to flush forward from behind and vent all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing other than jumping from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With the high-speed trains, you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including changing.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what was forged between the messages for secrets.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France beautifully speaks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-track financing promises (also referred to as "fast start" or early financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the coarse French fine-talks are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all registers to convince its partners of the fact that they are committed to the fast-start financing process: detailed progress report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it will have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which will bring it on the right path to respecting its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that additional use has been made without harming public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark he considers to be the best.
For example, the EU Commission has set itself the benchmark for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and will provide 150 million more than three years of fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In contrast, France considered that the funding of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France has given up its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € borrowed as equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission control projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be counted as an exposure (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking up 91.5% of loans (€389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU to use loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) carry out their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends EUR 1 to meet its commitments, France is just giving 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Nice Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swindle: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the Arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of early financing only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the overall discussion of the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equalising justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another topic that is crucial and currently debated): it does not escape the question of the "feasibility" or the nature of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive in terms of issues as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "feasibility" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise from the international trust base, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes on 81 different chemical substances over the day, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the small number of samples analysed do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration of the problem being dealt with," had bought the food normally consumed within four foods consumed by a child of about ten years at meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined as well as the nostrils of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The teller balance is ground-breaking: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disrupting factors, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the nearer whole of cases, it is very well taken that the reality, in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disrupting factors, is cause for concern," notes the association.
At breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three have been safely carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the minced steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spotted.
The analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the tap water.
During dinner the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was "most abundant", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damage cocktail" for consumers is "probably underestimated", the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has, in turn, proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
