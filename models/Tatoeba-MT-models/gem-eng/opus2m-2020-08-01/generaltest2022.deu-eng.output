The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the commodity value....
I'm #PRS_ORG# big customer and so it's no problem for me.
Need only a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be traced back by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and order again for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to play a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, help out, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself if this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
It's probably questionable in legal terms.
Perhaps, therefore, the psychologist’s statement comes.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire action, but the title partout doesn't want to come to my mind anymore. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, an animal nurse commits suicide by overburdening himself with food and going to his predators.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation of his therapists, operates a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously to go to the place of suicide before each suicide and document the photos and put them on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a anxiety center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients in the most extreme way of fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window one more drives herself with intent to die)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough story I'm pretty sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this action were known to anyone or even someone could reveal the title of the book to me, I would be delighted.
Oh, I don't have the password available for the Wlan.
Must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded ?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood splitter under the thumb nail (outside).
Tried to pull him with a tweezer.
It's very hard to get hold of.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost every locomotive of the track gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and come always with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically log in to a suitable digital centre.
He masters all DCC programming modes and with the help of RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main track with appropriate control points.
For headquarters that can program only the CVs of 1-255, there exist help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses allow the release of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to advance the booster vaccination
Always new Omikron cases acquire politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, therefore, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with the Corona refresher vaccinations in view of the rapid rise in Omicron numbers than has so far been sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said to his compatriots in a prerecorded video message on Sunday night.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why vaccination needs to be intensified urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased with a third vaccine dose.
"Now, let's get some steam!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron cases were recorded in the UK, increasing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am for everyone to imagine with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on the feet of any official.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronouns.
Got a total of 5 books on it.
4 of which go.
Only the one I bought today can't
Obviously, the chair had an undetected defect in sales.
How else can a padded injury occur after 9 months?
Only on the #PRS_ORG# try.
But it has been working since approx.
No more 14 days.
That's why I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something in detail here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact more often with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One topic that really sucks at me and unfortunately is too often that many victims don't let themselves be helped or think we couldn't help them.
I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the kids out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is partly very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the play on "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said to Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, it did not lie down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
Even more than the naked result, the way the performance was performed disappointed.
A statistic was mentioned that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer was given by John Patrick: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were simply not concentrated enough, and have not implemented what we have trained."
Namely moving the ball.
His opposite to Sebastian Gleim responded quite differently: "To win a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While Patrick's team itself failed the service providers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already settled down 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time is not left for Hadern.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've been in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally and have rewritten them for that reason.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Like the egg pelts: Max Raabe becomes 59
He was able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of beats from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not going to happen.
The planned concert was relocated in May 2022 - "by authority" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent season must first fail as it is called on the singer's website, which will be 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists will then want to reschedule their appointments already scheduled for 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and liked to sing as a youth.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of bats and chansons in the style of the comitian harmonists.
He was awarded prizes many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of the charts, just like his success album "For women, this is no problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blond hair is strictly combed back and thought of on labels, Max Raabe is no longer to be remembered from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created through expropriation
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has opposed the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been called for in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Day Mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is by the way the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert committee on how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation doesn't relax, Geywitz talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening in rental law didn't stop.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tight housing markets and an extension of the rental mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market still does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do they know when it will be available again ?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage capacity (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I will solve the new order independently
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
When the lamp is shipped in March, how long will the shipment take?
I've already cut my finger
This is an absolute frenzy.
At least 100 deaths from tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have passed through the United States.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind us of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornados in the U.S. have carried out severe devastation and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a snowfall of about 320 kilometres long, especially in Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said that after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was perplexed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He calculates alone in Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or was it completely removed from the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, only I can order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising logos to vaccination calls - according to a German example - is also intended to increase the willingness to use Corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been reading about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't sew himself in his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Assistance in the first own campaign
Boron to hell!
I'm just leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends about the gripping pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil guys and their motivations written, the individual file is invented and now I am writing the entrance adventure and already at the first Encounter I am stumbling over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are to take a drive with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
There the further action is to develop.
A few miles from the village, the hero is to lurk a group of Goblins and lure them into a ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: persuasion, action, threats, early detection of the danger, whatever the players may be.
Group strength: 8 ordinary Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with arches and sabers armed
If you don't notice, the Goblins lurk up the hero in a hollow path, flanking three to the left and right each with bows, arming the car while two with spears stop the car.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are under, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school, half-elf.
The cart is gone, of course.
2. Should defeat be inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants will enter and come to the help of the hero in battle.
The cart's still there, everything's great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter an entry into the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later on, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly cherish many of your ideas and now have even more confidence in my narratives.
I built the lamp out again.
And stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send them back anyway.
If you can then let the return slips come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm embarrassed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more so that I want to make myself a little air with this post.
First of all, the transmission was cancelled in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and start of the schedule was far behind the schedule, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 takes precedence and therefore has to limit everything else, so Sky DE had no choice here.
Nevertheless stupid, since Sky UK has transmitted the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 again, there was a lack of rules with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both didn't know that you can change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that steps may change the tires when there were corresponding radio phrases on this topic on Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this possibility exists for walking away.
I believe that such elementary rules should be known simply when commenting on the F1 at a pay TV station.
It is also not the first mystery rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the matter of rules.
In general, does not like the articulate comment style of Roos, but admits that it is a matter of taste.
But I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant jokes that make both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a total amount of unrest in the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the outlet Sky is the only station that goes into advertising, how to listen to F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also make less advertising in training than Sky, and this as a free TV broadcaster.
While Glock and Baumgartner must be praised for their work, that alone does not make me look beyond the disadvantages.
Sky Sport F1's remaining program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races that they are allowed to broadcast except for advertising.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
To the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short period of time (the material has a hole on the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal to supply an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire plants with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable to connect more outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump, it also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (see us in the shop) or with a décor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove to call shells or something like that.
The MK series has a special soundproofed construction and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an actuator etc....and it can already start.
The fan pump should be equal or higher than the water level and be fitted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a reversing valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent if once water runs backwards, that the water runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is fitted outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, it is packed daily and the packages are picked up here every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it's very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is right, just because it took a little longer.
It would be true that not everyone understands the entire staff who also work in the forwarding industry...of course here doesn't stop Corona.
Please don't judge as badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course, one likes to scoff at these services, even if at the moment we say...they've had a hell of a lot of trouble.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
how long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator and four more passengers made a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the Blue Origin company by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of Texas State.
Under brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally received the newly named astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Among the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometres.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nazi astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after the Blue Origin rocket system, and 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had paid the other four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each did not tell Blue Origin.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his operations and do everything by himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He'd love to return to space right away, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of about 100 kilometers above the ground, sometimes with zero gravity before the reusable object braked from large parachutes landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres above the Earth as a border with space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business of space tourism to a large extent without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject really quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not bother me (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
I have, of course, also informed myself about career prospects before my studies, but I thought at the time that I would definitely like to study and become a doctoral student.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially about the job prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) one hears over and over again super professional opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand one hears again and again of unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid places.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/ salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really insecure and consider possibly canceling my studies in 2022 and making a training as a specialist computer scientist.
If you have experiences there, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's a post.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operations.
As it seems, there are also holidays plus bridge days.
This was the case: last week Mary was Ascension, which is called "Auffahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, the most common people and businesses make a bridge day that is semi-official.
So it was a long four-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lauter e-mails, which had to come out before departure, order here, everything *independent* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" sounds like so much time and that can't be?
Or because the people of all seriousness want to do as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerfully generous.
What's this self-greed about holidays?
What are some holidays for if we don't have the right time to enjoy them?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is simple: are we just like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed evangelical style?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in their Thuringian homeland - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast, bake and make with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the reasonable days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now."
NECTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the re-formation of the spring.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
Most of the damage to feathers occurring in birdkeeping is due exclusively to dietary errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, it is essential for the formation of a perfect feathered dress that is particularly rich and balanced in protein nourishment of the bird.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or imbalance in protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most vegetable feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold-water soluble and can be simply administered via the drinking water or via the soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
I'm afraid it's still not working.
GDR manual work model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with play tracks and faults see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotives of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal-fired trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally working
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-tonne coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926 the DRG decided on the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a Tatzlag drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which received the E 95 01–06 operating numbers.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnenberichtungswerk Dessau, the value of all six locomotives was established.
[4] The three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked up in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger quantities were first built.
It was only when the E 94 saw that the number could not be increased further that the E 95 focused on the work.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at the Halle P railway station in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own orbital plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, complex control of locomotives proved problematic.
So it was more often that shooters were stuck in shifts.
Then the Beimann with hammer and wooden wedge, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the shooter again during the journey.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and led to months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s and no significant expansion of the electrical operation was planned at the time, the Reichsbahn could not operate on old locomotives and most split-series, so that the E 95 were put out of service.
In addition, they said that the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives once more, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the above-mentioned difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driving position.
[5] After the closure of the E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid 1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which was terminated on 5 October 1970.
The new name 255 001 was thus never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were split.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating system at the main train station Halle.
It took some time for the officials at the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 as a museum locomotive was worth it.
In 1979, the initial external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the interior of the locomotive was completed.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is run.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Hall P community have been working on the operational reworking of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, whereby the transformers were checked and five driving engines were operational.
-The locomotives were in operation on the Silesian track and the branching sideways until 1945, where they proved themselves on account of their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
The main use area was first Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, good function, there are optical reworking at the locomotive in self-work necessary, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may show labels and traces of storage.
Yes the F-parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The central beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beams cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The central beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I'm getting new ones sent.
When will they be sent forth?
No flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Mainly, they fulfil their purpose
With me they are not flat
Could I have these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage was caused in the six-digit euro area, as reported by the police on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reported to be brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoking.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume a deliberate burning.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck took over the further investigations.
But it'll arrive a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To unravel fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not yet made a public statement about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness moved him to it, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the Coronavirus.
In the social media there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution on the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me on which I am being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on to a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust".
Fear is only hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle himself explained.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritisation in Germany in vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, prioritisation has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss has been able to immunize himself three times according to the appropriate data.
Fire in rescanning plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transfer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transfer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 people affected by the fire went out of the lights in several municipalities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the major disturbance could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
In schools, the authorities offered care facilities and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the people affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology division, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz-Monteurs could only temporarily put some lines back into operation at first, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnet, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 p.m. has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transfer station.
There is a need for elaborate cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 the most recently affected by the failure would also have electricity.
More than 80 fixtures from Westnetz and partner companies had been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighbourhood and report to the local firehouses when help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power units, the focus was on the inhabitants of Altenheimen.
In addition, according to public authorities, temporary care facilities were provided in schools for those people who could not provide themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good afternoon!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and stay healthy.
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with tabletops diameter of #NUMBER#
we get 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to receive a feedback.
Well, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Do you send me the return note by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low credit almost insolent.
We do not agree with that.
Nordic combination: Combined rib win

Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be returned to my account?
Yes, we both made s new and use the version 4.5...
could be that they have heard more of problems

So if I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File is possibly incorrect you report to the customer service.
As far as I can see it it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?

I have to work in between!
To make the paint order even and clean, clean the components with some soapy water from dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 lines.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw brush evenly stroke next to stroke.
Light overlap of the colour layers later ensures a smooth surface.
Avoid quickly wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colours end up with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can become unbeautiful metal veils when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally true appearance reaches the models through the decals or decals.
From space signs on aircraft to ship names to decorations and car models: The decals give the model the last cut.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily attached before it is inserted into the hull.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks, are the gripping time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each required decal individually and correct it to you.
Decals are also called water slides because you dampen their back with water briefly until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wets.
Then you push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you wetten before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull off the carrier paper sideways.
Attention: Always check to see if the picture is correct before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick, crack or even tear your finger.
Soak up excess water with a household cloth.
Respect not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for the place until I read it.
AM Saturday I have already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you so much!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get this back easily?
Child Wish Treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together.
we have been in child care for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands across.
The order of:
We had applied for the Kinderwanschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The tests were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not calculate them with the PKV.
We applied again for the costs to be taken over by the passenger car and again received 3 further tests.
After some further tests (we have done more attempts than we promised, logically the most expensive ones with the car) we submitted the invoices to the car and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the car wants to pay only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise lapse.
The second request for a child was a new insurance case.
According to the General Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment of health, it ends if there is no longer any need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to refund the car (only 3 attempts) or we (it is 5 attempts to refund)?
* Would the passenger car have had to tell us in the promises that with a birth the further attempts would have passed?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (due to closed egg ladders) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave their opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to me best?
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They are welcome to pass this on to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the refund was made and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I don't think I can do anything to make the chest of drawers completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund has been triggered and I have still not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise they can't sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be advertised with additional stools to be acquired, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget movies
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What makes you so attracted to it?
And what do you not like at all?
Is a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
Would like to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With kind greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, there is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus at high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania," said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not solve the confrontation on a sustainable basis, said the researchers at the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This situation - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Dealing with the people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bosson judged.
There seems to be an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole was not determined to turn around, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot prevail if a Member State is in the head to do its thing," as is the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" had been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross-border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to cross Belarus into Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday at night and returned to the border, said a spokeswoman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been stoned in the incident near the village of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was caught in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
A total of 52 border guards tried border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU urges Alexander Lukashenko, as a power holder in Minsk, to have lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to the press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response was the pressure on the airlines, said Bosong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bans and extraterritorial sanctions."
Reductions should also take account of domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security apparatus regularly drags thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen has committed two violations of the rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Following the controversial Abu Dhabi Formula 1 final, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows assume two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max's steps in the Red Bull during the last safety car phase when he was supposed to have been regularly overreacting.
A second objection was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not complied with.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton had taken his first Formula 1 title in the Mercedes.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Dutch had overtaken a car that was driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thanks for the support

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit doesn't mean anything.
It's like an adult says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i will not admit it both.
But colleague constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yeah, well, then you're as little serious as your colleague.
Whoever seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science just nonsense.
And that means you're a science enemy and not to take any further seriously like Colleague
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approximated as closely as possible to the eye.
The specially designed aplanatically achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying and colour error-free lens up to the edge zone.
Lupens are often marked with magnification indications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To make optimal use of your magnifying glass, please note the information in the "Technical Data" table (see the instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflexes occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - even when they are impacted.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
If the optimum conditions of use are met - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less visible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannenhandel in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such a healthful situation during the sale of fir.
One time a man should even have driven home without his partner, because both could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2,000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curious situation.
That always makes the pre-Christmas time a little funny, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And so they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which sounds by far not so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit until a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbits to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, on the other DLan module, which broadcasts the Wifi, no longer the full 500, but the further I escape in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a socket which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similar large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optics so much internet speed is "lost" about the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely difficult to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the account
Who would have thought that now would be peace with the giroconts, sees itself deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to get confirmed once again by their customers with all kinds of tricks, the increase in fees of the past also decreases the free amounts for negative interest rates.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she halved the allowance once and even quadrupled for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros at Giro and investment accounts and to 25 000 euros for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesman on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as well as with the ING Germany.
The DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount of free money to two levels, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks, according to the figures of the Verivox website, now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparka-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin have even got the right against this regulation.
Now the banks are already discussing whether institutions should possibly make provisions - in the case that even the upper institutions have to explain the negative interest rates in principle for inadmissible and pay back many millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For them, who made terror in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
Her appearance takes care of an entire army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
After all, according to Aniston, she enjoys a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a ONE-TIME chip out of the bag).
The fact that you are still flying the hearts of female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just bad luck - and she's still looking for great love.
And deleted the baby wish from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked me that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really offensive.
Keep hoping that also make success and fame happy.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than I thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off the gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight tire contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the great price of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finished his career in the motorsport kingship.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children were also on their way to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's biggest success was the win of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in double bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of Bobpilot.
"I figured it out once, I would have to win nine and a half wins per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday he prevented the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and went out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he made his way to the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory into the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who drove for Stuttgart, came to second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer of the BC Bad Feilnbach landed on the eighth place in fourth place in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I'd do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won the third season in the second round of the season on her home track.
On Sunday, after reaching the fourth place in Monobob the day before, she raced the World Cup with her German three-time success with Deborah Levi.
Two-bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came second with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podium in this winter in addition to her Olympic qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first poodest place in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today," said Burghardt, stressing, "It's not just a push, but there's a lot to do around here."
Jamanka was a little annoyed by the not quite flawless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore can't redeem why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never time for them.
And now he said he'd run out of something that really annoys me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then order again, because it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No, it's not until I tap an extra field with the message.
Was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just that day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, great girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe it's the one - or the other, too...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogemama - once apart from my dog not screaming or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I still have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in the association of burning).
He's cooled up, and we're seeing less (1-2x week) right now, which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just got abdominal pain, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cow's blanket and he's been a little relaxed after I was there with the heat lamp and caressing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
There is also housework on us now, which we naturally divide.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is very well adjusted, I am partially well-treated and well-reached.
Not good, but I'll be fine, and I'm almost symptom free.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have done nothing and the day after tomorrow anatomy hour for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam right on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room left.
So this is how my week goes: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing goes on?
It's only until your birthday.
Only until the holiday starts.
Just till the weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental clues because otherwise I'll put it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Is that how it goes?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am really infinitely grateful, I cannot put that into words.
I don't know if I would otherwise have survived my kptbs.
I think that has some to do with women's mental load, and that's why I thought I'd find a lot of pain here...
I certainly wish you a restful evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and the table leg has a print.
At the first delivery, the colour was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
Now that we're changing the table, do I get any other color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times, by the way.
But she was not confirmed.
Sometimes something completely different: I found in school at the time that many religious teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian, and I always believed that way.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell about colleagues in work and study with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a syllabus, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, makes one want to teach religion if one does not believe it?
Maintaining Culture or Something?
Hope you ask is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Please write in English I understand that too well
It's been a long time, and then I'd give up on it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a response in time until the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thanks for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hey, guys.
I am looking for a film from my childhood (at 24).
I think it's been a film for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live for himself, I mean.
I believe that the transition is also the site of the soldier's grave.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little girl slept on her belly only from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around here, no custodians, more often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but they've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when it's asleep.
Is it turning the head sideways?
Can it rise from the belly out of something?
Or is it with the face ahead Directly in the mattress?
You can derive from that if everything's all right.
We all grew up too, and when my husband came to the world, it was like walking and pretending to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stammkunde" with you and have already bought many products
But why do you only offer me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit into the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To be quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this station is now under control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a big beggar tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet station.
Citation Arno: You don't want to be a running lipstick.
What is it now?
A 0815 advertising station trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They may, of course, continue to offend people.
A Krogman who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ashes.
How do you like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call to Rueck since my supplied wooden table was defective.

Cherry core cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry core heat can be absorbed very well and delivered dosed again.
The removable inside cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry core cushion with reference is suitable for the following applications only:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical smell, stick or fire spots and dispose immediately if there is any.
Please remove the inner cushion to warm up beforehand from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the pillow!
Then put the inner cushion back into the reference.
In the first heats, mild moisture formation can occur on the surface, but disappears with repeated applications.
Keep to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flame and burn risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your elbow!

Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the football league.
Hannover 96 is currently working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it does not run under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
Error indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite inserted power supply.
After that, I expanded the battery, but here too, nothing is happening.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in power?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still lots of equipment?
No problem with Peak Design's Everyday V2 Backpack!
20 liter capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proved itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a closure hook made of metal with matching anchor bars in the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, which are stablely destroyed, into which the fastener can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Valves and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without invading the hooks.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wander through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday fitness of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more about below) and thus easily store both of them separately from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings.
So you can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safe in the left backpack half and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also entirely made of 100% recycled, weather-proof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait for the email of their support in vain.
#NAME# gave me an email yesterday out of confirmation for the assignment of
Contact is announced by the freight forwarder to pick up the wrong table.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support employee, I did not go beyond the promise that I get an e-mail as confirmation.
This is the return of the wrong custom #NAME#
It is obvious when the cabinet could be returned?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It's working.
Many thanks for the help
Have a nice evening.
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately give up a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year went differently than I thought I could not guess and just couldn't redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer, and I don't accept it.
Red brake discs are designed to assess the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Red brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically worked (drilled and cut).
All tinted discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are suitable for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is established, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
In addition, the openings created increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fragments in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were put down, tents were pitched, and Saloons and hotels were built almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outsmart your pioneer colleagues not to mess with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, need to budget with your resources and create a tableau that "works" for you more and more (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to get additional actions or to turn rules to your liking.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained the official statehood).
One year in Coloma consists of five laps.
During each round, players will be secretly and at the same time select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as gaining resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The laureate turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the laureate moves five times, so each location has once covered up and the year ends.
There's a shooting in which the players have to defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gun heroes and are superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they will receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he triggered a fierce educational debate.
Former patient:Inmates and educators now make serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Never, never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the loss of testing requirements for triple vaccines
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide waiver of the obligation to test three-fold vaccines.
"We countries quickly need clarity as to whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for three vaccinations," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The loss of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines was "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional immunisation," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has said that "he will make a proposal for this at the Health Minister's Conference on Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do my best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't do any more shopping about my #PRS_ORG#.
Warning: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I've updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds/voices, the rarest to see pictures and the rarest to perceive pain.
For this topic relevant: emperor cuts are operations associated with an increased rate of Awareness, since a very deep anesthesia is avoided for the protection of the child until the navel.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the anesthesia interview.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, this comment by me describes although Awareness correctly, though had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
I read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ will not help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again whether they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair in private.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and invoice states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver on the doorstep - because #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order as I do not know any person who can carry me the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not going to call?
I had put a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He was a theatre critic and an instigator.
Later he wrote a monumental play story.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh in print: "An old man is getting older".
The shaking diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've testified to my way of life here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standard wooden pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as load carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics from Austria in 2020, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was well 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported annually into Austria is not collected
New York gets MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to make the final in the eleven-meter shooting with 4:2.
In the finals of the Eastern Conference, New York had won the battle against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Routing Tips & Tricks
I had here a week ago got lots of great tips for the perfect gulasch.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook at New Year's Eve for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back to my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not that good anymore, but I get it.
IIt is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by e-mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money hasn't been received from me.
Would you check there, please?
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, Gans or ducks belong to Christmas days such as the fir tree and the gifts.
You didn't get any poultry yet?
Now the time is running out.
We'll tell you where you'll get another Christmas bread in Lübeck's room.
The "Drive" of a tube finish significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the content of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
Further on, it was already said that the POWER LEVEL controller can even make a power reserve when it goes out loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone socket can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphones or direct shots.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
Anyone who additionally spends a VFS5 footkey can also easily access the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "stop" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is actually essential for the live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it in others.
Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Do we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a discount or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need then are a lot.
I have just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not paid off
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
Progress has been made in the negotiations on the revitalisation of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irna.
This was a "positive and important development" because at first there had not even been a consensus on the topics to be discussed.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the revitalisation of the agreement had been continued after almost one week of interruption.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was located at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths associated with an infection were reported within one day.
200 severely affected Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
On weekends, there may be a delay in reporting.
In addition, health services have been overburdened for weeks and hardly come back with the detection of new cases.
I understand.
As the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it at the post office, right?
here I don't need to click/give/fill anything further?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take delivery at my own expense.
8 euro Return Fee is, in my view, a frenzy.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greet me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Where's the mail here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extant.
We have come into a winter star and have extended the summer hole to several months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what's it all about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been more and more that many here really still have Bock on MBundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag, who wants to keep it alive.
The start came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has, simply said, found a cluster of shards.
After some writing and writing down, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, once again I would like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project still exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be modified / adapted / removed?
* How should we act outside in the future?
* How are new members to be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot something, but it's not bad, and we'll have the discord in the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically on the future.
I ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there also in oversized size, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will remove the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how it can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there a manual for installation?
How long do I have time to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself has lived vegetarianly for a while, at the moment probably also very rarely eat meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and Vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support the animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal torture.
Therefore my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that her side was disgusted, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her flesh came from and was being reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without being put on it.
It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance marketing.
I am at the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# my return does not pick up on site.
Since I can't be on the spot because of a funeral, it can't be changed either.
Can I be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From the 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be able to find again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for water rescue equipped: 45.000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior Roger Lewentz at the Lahnstein City Hall handed over a grant of 45.000 euros for the new equipment car Water rescue of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the diving squad Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom of the hotel's navigation on Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the lahn as a leisure flow, is expected to contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations however have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded has NOT worked.
I am a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for putting yourself here for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, that is, we were also arms carriers in the executive, I do not want to go further on that!
I always find the question of right and left very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms carrier people are magically attracted to the right of conservatively should also be clear to everyone that these people can, of course, be difficult to deal with the living reality, of course, because you have, of course, besides the average white man, now many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and now I do not mean the excessive feminine clichés, because in the executive there are rather less to nothing but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice when they don't tell you) and also to these people and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they save your life or use it for you.
But these marginal groups also, even if it sounds strange to me for the first time, are proud of Germany and feel less caught up in exaggerated left-wing politics, even though this policy is supposedly committed to it or it is supposed to have to do it right, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, as of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will find extreme rights there, but they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign use often start to break up due to negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
Also, it is certain that right-wing contemporaries meet who are engaged in a lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I think this is a good fight and is also countered by political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good enough in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but on the top of the edge of the wood part are two deep sheaves filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than right to lead my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it takes me and I to clean up and clean up.
But it is actually never so 'that someone could come to visit spontaneously'.
My husband is not (unfortunately) better either, although it bothers me somewhere but usually just loses household against work and discomfort.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We don't have anything yet, but we've been working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and e.g. there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child, or do you stay slutty?
Look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have been in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I find more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's hard for me to have easy conversations and I've been told more often that I'm acting inextricably (which I think is already better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, the addiction counseling or the family support.
However, I do not know whether the real working day is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it always drags me down when there is something to complain about in my code ("still the easiest things are getting hit again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know for myself how to do it" / "I keep him from working with my stupid questions" / "who really must think I'm less middle" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
But did you get the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean, give it back, please!
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be your #PRS_ORG# authoring this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and from it builds up its own body proteins, which it also needs to form feathers.
The formation of feathers in nestling and the formation of feathers in the masting bird are extremely complex processes and for the overall organism of the animal are associated with a particularly high stress.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as there may otherwise be disturbances in the brooding process.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, it is appropriate to return to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NECTON organic on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
A sliced measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the event of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio may be given at the beginning until the replication approach is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the spring replication is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to inform you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a municipal employee in reply to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be liked on our property.
So, fall application to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the fall of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statute.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the Statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I have not received any message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany.
Can you check it out?
Eilbericht: Heavy traffic accident at Self

There are injuries.
Ah, okay.
Well, then thank you again for being so easy!
Advice and ideas on further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
My Christmas is, unfortunately, moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking about everything you can tear apart.
Before I get out here .. in short: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just doing the ref as a cross-inner.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to at least stay a little anonymous, I do not call anything more precise here).
But all this was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "google other job offers".
And it's only been six months.
At the time of the paintings I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still turn around.
But just now I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I've been completely exhausted.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening.
There I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much of a stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that even bother me.
Basically, it is fun and seen from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it's completely sealed - if he's not already doing that.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my working life - just when I read some of you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take my free time if I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was adequately paid for it, and together in a team what has worked out and not as an individual fighter like that is now most of the time.
But then I wonder if in a year I did not arrive again at the same place as now and dissatisfied.
You see, it's all kind of weird, but maybe you have as external advice or ideas, like I get out of this situation that I'm completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for my whining undertone.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has developed steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scaffolding, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine, which is absolutely up-to-date in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamp.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only sprutter.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined it.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which once again resulted in a performance shift of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists will find a maximum sound range here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amp: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playful play and string stroke as well as an prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the end stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor level of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reflects the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters by his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday 104:106.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually plating and foldable velcro parts, it is designed to suit the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflector cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible mounting would be a DSLR camera with a used lens, two to three alternating lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for non-photonic things.
Drone drivers also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption in La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano occurred in 1585 with 84 days as the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on past outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but vulcanologists dared no longer predict when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV station RTVE.
Damage in million height
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast due to cold lava.
The most important banana cultivation for the island was heavily affected, of which about half of the approximately 85.000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and were in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crushing tension of something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peaceful "social treaty of natural peoples", which can escape rigid routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus Became the Christchild
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on Nikolaustag.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, a bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gifting, the custom popular in Germany emerged to fill the boots especially for children with gifts.
Protestants encountered this custom because they reject mediators between God and man as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they are acting against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christchild from Nikolaus and thus established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the holy evening.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions as closely, it only annoys the least that the custom of Saint Nicholas is, like Martinssingen and Martinszuzug, still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches everything the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christianly influenced countries, there is a joyful Kuddel moth about the question of who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, to which some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white noise bar, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who should have shown them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fables bring gifts, while in Russia it brought some fame to Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull their sleds as troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police are shooting suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
Shots had been shot and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the Kensington Palace area.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into every beet, garden or stone garden.
The lamp is easily set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earthspikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminance duration max. 10 h
- The robust plastic version can be used in the outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, there are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in colour.
On the other hand, »Smart Stone« is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in equal to six different shades of colour).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also makes himself in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of preliminary work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require any supply or batteries.
Set the "Lightstone" to an arbitrary, day-to-day, sunny place.
Two supplied earth skewers ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dawn, »Smart Stone« begins to shine automatically; in which color, you determine it yourself: Six attractive light colors are your choice – next to daylight white.
After all, switching off is done automatically as soon as the battery charge level is reduced to a specified minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the front.
I've done that several times, it doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to have ordered further from you, but if the voucher is not charged to me, I'm not going to order any more on principle.
If you think otherwise, let me know.
Otherwise, it was the last contact today.

Pill problems
Hello dear female people,
I hope I do everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to keep it back, because I have to take enough drugs through chronic diseases that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had got my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive picks and these everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it was quite stressful to me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two years of break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without a lot of noise, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, a female doctor didn't take me so seriously and a dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, dear skin is such a thing.
Had vorbupertary severe neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale lump braids and the acne theme.
I also tried nutrition in the course of Chr. disease everything possible and have stayed on ner sugar, milk and meat poor mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in there, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere, you don't want to go looking for what else is wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o. . .
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I have to work in between and on the phone, and all of a sudden everything was gone...
what is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
But there's him in general in big

In the name of the people: laymen pass judgments
In the courtroom they sit in everyday clothes on the bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear robes: Schöffen determines with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two out of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.

110 kV earth cables are being rebuilt 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The planning decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was now communicated to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre earth cable will connect the Tann power station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of the free line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning.
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.

All three other packages have arrived so that delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A nice start to the week!
You can forget, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of glass and the entire sides are cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers can't be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's for all books, that's why the question at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Plan lessons (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I’ve been in Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems to plan my education in the field of Earth Science for time-efficient time.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so that I can in principle only use the board, the school book and a OHP as a medium.
In the school I can also only copy b/w for free (which is nerved for gedkunde).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and I actually have every hour of it.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go from the goal of learning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
For this reason the worksheets are also available.
Perhaps I can work with the book in a way that is time-efficient.
I'd really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to do the return as soon as possible.
The trade fears about the Christmas business because of the 2G rule.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or cured are allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and complaining of sales disruptions.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G rules destroy the important Christmas business to the retail sector.
In the case of transactions with non-daily needs, sales disruptions should be criticised, HDE Chief Executive Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies were negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
Good runs only in food retail as well as in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with a mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief manager.
"2G when shopping does not bring us forward in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required high staff use.
The volume regime had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, each customer had to be checked only once for 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all shops with the received volume on that day.
Moreover, in the retail sector - as in the public transport sector - sampling should be sufficient for the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of this important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Officer Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high staff and administrative effort, the Centre will seek to find and approve solutions.
This includes the so-called tape solution, where "the visitors can, for example, enter all shops in a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that of a club hotel - undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that was attempted with a yellow filler to be cascaded.
That looks unbeautiful.
I would like to give the mirror back and have packed it back into the package and glued it back.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiant angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness adjustment in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory spaces, simply press one of the memory keys and finish.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when you turn on it - very practical when you are working on the studio, for example when the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the batteries have sufficient power - it is a battery tester identical to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection to fix it, so you can directly access your photo stand.
The inclination is to be adjusted reliably by means of detectors on both sides.
It was made sure that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the supply.
Great is that which is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy, without any problems.
Too bad, I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a stormy comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two-time series of Hessen-Sieglosen was supposed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up and, within a good hour, began to fret over a season start from the soul and won furios with 5:2. "It is madness what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and spoke out a "Pauscal praise, to each one who was with them".
At the beginning it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters who were still in rank nine behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also defender Christopher Lenz, who has been able to stand on the square for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to seeing the results especially for the audience.
That was the party we were about to throw today.
But Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him for the upcoming tasks, but he also sees himself well positioned for this with regard to the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and carry out the tasks up to the turn of the year "on this level".
On Wednesday, an outbound game will be held at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order has been rescinded?
Would it be for me then, unfortunately, that I will not be ordering again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Shocks for handball women in front of quarter finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women scolded with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
At the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection took place at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers took a hard defeat and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter final.
"We were much too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game that we have to wipe out," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, the 2019 World Championships will have to increase significantly in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German shipyard in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backroom player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in the attack, nor in the defense," admits retrospace player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now look forward quickly".
From front to rear not at the height
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team with the pitcher was not on high.
Mistakes and technical faults in the attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 relapse after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was achieved by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick run-off.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
The German women could hardly stand in the scene against the aggressive coverage of the Danes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game had run early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
But in the quarter final, she is allowed to take part again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came into play a little better and until the break at least at five goals.
The only quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener guards sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-founded opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer catch up on a performance increase and went out of the park as a clear loser.

The title is available, I am active as an vaccine in mobile vaccination teams where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are ready to go to a large extent, it goes on for me in part in vaccination centres.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, I tolerate it with the vaccination.").
In my area of task, the information for vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to Corona vaccine regulations and no reasons to speak against) is the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have one, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but cannot carry out vaccinations (must?), so that I also do most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy Huidler Question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "huidler"?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television program "We in Bavaria" has been used for intense thought.
But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" in the series "Host mi?" this time remained untouched by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV hostess, was completely wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused amazement in many upper palaces.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the rather familiar word "houlders".
What closed down an educational gap - probably also with many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy any more books for two weeks.
It always comes after confirmation the following error message: opens - something wont wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
The tyre choice at the racing wheel really so pan-safe?
This morning, I woke up with a lot of action because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour in the coming week.
Said, done and I drove my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happens in so every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) lurked.
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud zigzag and my rear tire did not want to take part in the rest of the route at all.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real opportunity to get a replacement jacket and a replacement hose, I had to turn around with a bit of a bad mood and take the first train home.
It was not very bad, perhaps it's better if I do it again before the bike tour with the tire change.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, on the day I picked up the bike until 14am 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal, because he had been riding with them on a roll for several years.
But if I think I have to make another tire change when I drive after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really bad mood :D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be unflattered.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so uncaputable?
I don't want to spend 40€/mushrooms now, just to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I wonder: I think I have at the moment on the racing bike 25x622.
Although there are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a race bike to other tires?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laiewissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and my greetings!
Car blazing against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was rallied on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a Middle Island and then entered the counterrail, as the police reported.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then hurled against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also be reborn.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and visually reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designed foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a much lower role, but to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it acts remarkably adult and for its size extremely impressive and accurate.
Tonal was tuned to the SOLO 15 with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally common in widebands to optimize the high frequencies, which are strongly increasing.
The SOLO 15 convinces exactly on the hearing area with a very clear and fine sound.
The high-tone range can be reduced easily to the outside and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the dot sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo corner is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspects extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is advisable to begin by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, one wants to veneer the housing, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer carries material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place, in order to be able to run the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of an overhead milling machine, the speaker opening in the front is followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used in a flush manner.
This opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside it.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these the back wall, the lid, the front and the ground are glued.
The three stiffenings should also be used and glued.
The stiffenings themselves can vary in the material thickness if you want to use, for example, finished strips from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a wood drill, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the terminal clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Then you use a circular milling machine to round all edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can be rounded as well.
The base plate is then glued firmly with the base of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and predrilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow out), you start by laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncut cable can be pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the foot to the terminal opening and let it stand there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the speaker opening and it also hangs loosely there.
The frequency week is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency softness, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be found in the following document: Installation instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency softness is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSEFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot adhesives onto the opening and lock them.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the damping follows as described.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered at the top of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the stated length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I give up an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we will again be organising the OSCAST again this year!
> We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people to the studio for known reasons, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-termity of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people on board, so that we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give anything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will begin at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
