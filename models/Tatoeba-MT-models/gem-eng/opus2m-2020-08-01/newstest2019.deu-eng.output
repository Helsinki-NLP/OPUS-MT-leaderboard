In the afternoon another surprise awaits our candidates: they will not dispute the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but at the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cooking, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Münchnerin" candidates during the shooting with People photographer Tuan deliver and defy wind, gasch and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is available in the video:
DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that depends, of course, on one getting into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt it as if it were laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "picture magazine.
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed at some point that this would be so," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and had also explained that Grindel had not defended him against racist adversities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build up pressure, but he knows it from football so that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with his coach and I find it a pity that this conversation has not been done so far".
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartenziedlung burned
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire department was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly across the Schrebergarten settlement, danger was in default.
The professional fire department pulled out and found the cabin in full fire upon arrival.
The roof had to be practically removed to the full and fire-fighting was removed to the most necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cottage, he had infected a battery to the store at noon.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity, according to fire brigade.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable because the owner had many collectors' pieces in his garden cottage.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks a refugee family on the open road
What only led Lindsay Lohan to this very strange action?
Apparently, she wanted to extricate the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has herself streamed live, as she apparently wants to tear away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial cross section of the stream.
Here you can see "Kissing lucky" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan getting out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses adults of engaging in child trafficking.
For all of this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is listening to in the video how she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earpiece.
Under tears, the actress depends on how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved towards this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are mentioned.
The number of victims could increase even further.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into the devastated areas cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief
At first, there was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a retreat of the Eletro Automaker.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he is allowed to remain Chairman of the Board.
British Conservative Party
Sharply guarded - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
At the party's meeting, it is intended to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new state name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name-duplicates for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will in future be called northern Macedonia and will vote on this Sunday for the population - whether or not it is well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Der nicht") - is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential elections in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went on the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Thislgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force is still in place," said development director Peter Mertens of the "Automobilwoche" magazine.
The arrested and retired Audi-Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/geartrain combinations were expected to be tested," he said.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July, we reached an important stage in the resolution of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automaker had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities shall request the Audi chief to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values, as the exhaust gas fraud has become known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
At the moment, Sales Director Bram Schot is leading the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the change to the new emission and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for limo, such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Shot relies on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there were already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives for re-election - Lahm is to be sent to the DFB Presidency
Mainz (dpa) - In spite of criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for office as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to make them as good as I can," said Grindel as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association would find it "wonderful" if he had not "been willing to work on the future project" after the match for the European Football Championship 2024.
Grindel has been Head of the Association since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been overthrown by the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for the first complete term of three years.
The next vote will take place on 27 September 2019 at the DFB-Fundestag.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he would also be advised in this role in the future in the Bureau and then, of course, would be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting questions," said Grindel.
In speculation whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in future a national player should become an integration messenger of the DFB without any migration background.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person is clearly involved in society and football without any migration background and says, "the topic is important, then we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
Proper weight loss with semi-smart scales
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight but also the body fat content.
It can also display muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
He doesn't tell me if I've replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear succession for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin was launched with a clear victory for the new season of the Basketball League.
In contrast to Science City Jena, the vice- champ won a convincing game with 112:55 (52:31) for over 40 minutes.
Roka's Giedraitis was the leading Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counter) from Ludwigsburg showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory debut.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the compulsory play debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was among the guests with 24 points of the best throwers.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came to 14 counters.
The last-year-old playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg conquered the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the best shooter in the team of coach John Patrick with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the basketball lions Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder has been a majority shareholder since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Review of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver living followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens no matter where they live.
We will not allow the sympathizers of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the city centre of Cologne had been partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in operation - among them also snipers.
The Islam Association Ditib is critical because it is regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horror Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have won a joint concert in the New York Central Park for more commitment in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Involve you wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on the night to Sunday before about 60.0000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with fringes and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed up on stage at the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a horrific second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal lock for shots got scared and tried to escape.
In a short time, panic developed, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed people from the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to catch one had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrüfe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake was appointed judge on the Supreme Court in the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse up to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of allegations after he faced two women, who reportedly experienced sexual assaults themselves, on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also come with me at any time in an elevator," Flake said at the concert in New York about the crowd.
Freedom of the press: Federal Government defends journalist's waste
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist's waste of the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the chancellor's office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had covered a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The t-shirt, had not been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was about a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
That's why he's made people's protectors bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also not sure before the Turkish authorities: only in early September was the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Last but not least, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a sensation.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey they still run processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and good-looking: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look at it twice: Yes, this is truly Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid discussions at the bar of the Hamburg harbor pub "Schellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine, or even higher percentage drinks to loosen the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory vocal contributions.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Loveliest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely bruised on it, his eyes only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely emaciated Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some knowledge - probably not very serious - that he has now gained: "Rule one: does NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which ina throws at half past three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips on how to combat aftertastes.
They were supplied with instant brothing, fish bread or - probably the most effective - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinemastar.
How Ina Müller has survived the nocturnal sale is not yet known.
Since she has moderated the TV fun on the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be significantly more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and delinquency
The entry into the 36-kilometre long railway cycle path in the Red Riding Hoodland in Treysa presents itself difficult to invent and dirty.
Recipes against grazing vandalism are sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shards, cigarette tippers, garbage and turf, demolished garbage buckets and now dismantled notice signs - this has been the case for a long time since the entry into Treysa with a group of seats to the cycle path on the Haaße hill.
A more than illustrious sight for the rail cycle path in the red-capped country.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC Schwalmstadt local group but also others for a longer time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been included in the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point for celebration on weekends.
It is not only often loud, the conditions are also destroyed: paws are torn from the ground, garbage buckets are demolished, signs are kibbled, seat furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klipert.
But the actions were only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the cycle path in Treysa is the meeting point for storage.
"During the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Häße hill," confirms the cycling commissioner, who now also takes care of the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance on the hill: "This may significantly increase the threshold to engage in common property.
This would, however, imply that a police patrol would come by in time.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wishes to develop the Hate Hill.
It had to be made more attractive.
You could be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still open to expansion.
Our cycle path is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no turning-off on the hate hill.
In the event of frequent traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the Hiltrup district offensive, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyelashes in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it was soon a family affair with coffee and cakes from the officials of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltraper star colours", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten of Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, declared district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We haven't seen this in other parts of town yet.
What was the connection between the lyrics?
At the places the Hiltruper lake and the market hall were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Hemig chose the avenue in his beating song to be the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also honoured.
Time and again it was about the experience of one another in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the performers or clues to her work.
It was learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now he was also teaching guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can hear their songs as well.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record an entire CD with sound engineer Schmmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: He with his Hiltrup bat, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children appeared again at the final - and even sounded "right good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, melodicness and recognizability.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the business association and Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had brought about the event on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a full success.
Everyone was "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords can only be deciphered - the old trick with the red slide - once you have inserted them.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything by mistake.
For example, on the cards you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
3rd cube.
4th party".
These are the terms that must henceforth be encrypted.
Because here the terms are not to be guessed, but codes.
One player per team alternately is the encoder.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2.".
In "Decrypto" it is not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "dice", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not as much as possible; because that wins the game if he succeeds twice in cracking the code.
The encoder thus notes and reads out loud: "Picking" for the cubes, "Lose" as opposed to the party; here, of course, something like "Party" would be possible and "Prag" because he took care of the school and knew the fall of the window there.
This is how it goes round for round, team for team.
While you do not know the terms of the opposite side, you can better reconcile them with any hint the cipher gives there.
So, as mysterious as possible, but not too upset, the descriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessary for your team to do so.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rule book.
The participants probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
But once you've started, you'll be fascinated by how much you feel in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as decisive as predecessors and genre prime "Codenames", which also supports an agent theme on a game of less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is just about guessing and not about victory points, who can easily find a version for two more.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strip, and later he also found himself in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly not alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulmbach in the detention centre.
In a sober state, he must then also be responsible for the use of IDs of non-constitutional organisations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
For decades, the railway station in Pressig was the hub in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, they heard it all over Pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't hurt anyone.
The brakes were soaked and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railroad.
Statements that stand symbolically for Dinkel's home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp stretch to the north, which after an increase of about 220 metres in height has its head in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, former train and Schubloks were needed, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprenticeship workshop, train and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway.
Pressig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehsten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the line in 1939 already minimized the need for train and drawer blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
At least 10,000 weighings were placed in the month until 1991.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cut off, 1991 the rest.
Heinrich: "It is regrettable that no better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport, has been envisaged".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pompous railway festival in Pressig for the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, while the Presig marshalling station was history.
"The rangers and ski jumpers did the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any miscarriage would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the Hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the InfrankenPlus article.
Kerber with tailings at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world ranking third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russians put on number 13.
The Schwäbin now gets to do with Aunt Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition in Mittelehrenbach was opened at the weekend during the series "Kunst und Gnüss".
With great relief, registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open-air area of Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mitteleehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a large audience.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
As well as Volker Hahn, who, as the main organizer and artist, made a name for himself.
A little surprising, but a few days ago, Hahn announced his resignation.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already played an active part in the selection of the artists in the past and have been involved in designing flyers.
This year again, on the occasion of art & pleasure, there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed by them, available at every art station.
This year's "Better Dance" poster, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical setting.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly becomes aware that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges and ultimately expresses the artistic imagination.
They are metal or ceramic works of art, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property awaits the visitor on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, brightly lit, playful with 20 windwheels, 24 horseshoes and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairytale and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Washneck, who preferably devotes 15 years of K&G to the event in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On a half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind of the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination-form of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for strolling through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtenians, too, were at that time indignant.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to think that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cecilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the tin bush they raised the MGV 68 albachtes from Baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of the Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," thought Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
On time for the 50th anniversary, the traditional festival was back.
An elegant ball it was asked for festive clothes had been asked before.
The guests did not sit in the "house of meeting" in seating rows as usual, but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime movement was popular: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the regulators and asked for the dance floor.
It is a matter of honour that the singers of the MGV made 68 albachten sound the voice themselves.
Suitable for the occasion were cheerful songs.
Almost already set: "As a day, as beautiful as today".
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In alluding to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Again sovereign was the choir director of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at that time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "He has such a light way, it's a master performance he performs." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves in song.
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes, above all, Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Singer Theo Weber had sat on the desk until 3 a.m. to create his own rhyme.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a large Tombola.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The climber's marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under the patronage of Axel Büring is quite right in league three.
No trace of shyness or fracking noises, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately admitted: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We're not happy." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party of Ronja de Boer the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third movement, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring it into the goal, such a game can already tilt," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full exploitation to its destination.
"All of us are aware of who is standing in such a Derby on the other side.
It won't break our necks.
I have seen real good volleyball in stages," Annacker did not agree with the 0:3 - and immediately moved on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the independent does not seem to be possible after just three days of play.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With Regionalliga volleyball, this is not nearly comparable." In the fourth league, they don't want to look down anyway.
If the vest is not contaminated in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven lots.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee enters Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly of the fact that the series may have had a share of her marriage affair with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase, and many of my admired colleagues noticed me at eye level," recalls Keller in conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
First of all, she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but "how many men were shooting at his conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only one right and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have changed my mind", as she continues.
She always felt "not being good enough for him.
He saw inside me an emancipated woman, who I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes once again, "although I was afraid that it might go wrong a second time as well."
On the day before the wedding I sat crying in the closet and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never made it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had come up with love at the time "as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I have come to love far too naively."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the Zurich NZZ resort, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our father is not a moth, but he's a little shy.
And the glimmer in which a green carpet is dipped on the six-leaf place blinds it over fee.
But it's a film festival, because more or less famous people want to sunbathe in the spotlight.
Thus, on this late Thursday evening, he dries over the square to make it easy in the "Aquaclean-WC oasis".
For example, the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needy institution in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to pour out a luxurious ambience.
This evening, however, it stinks in the men's oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, on the other side of the road: Invited guests who have just had the best level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store every year.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: The works shown are known from all over the globe.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival, in order not to fall into the trap of the 190 partner companies.
The fold binds itself to a tape around the feelers, who have put a good fairy on him, and two bully doorsteps actually wave him generously in.
Inside the barn, they dance to live music long after midnight, or they can be pretended by DJ rhythms to which they cry at each other, and rinse down with Cüpli exquisite hippies.
In the delicacy shop in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for culling mouths, next door the incomparable raw ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate well is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The falter studies the sign at the escalator: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If the two are separate instructions, he's lost his way in the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry tilts a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price of the best drink is not mandatory for this mix with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting this brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But there, between local prominence, cash desk and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It's not likely that his main actor will be far off.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with almost sixty almost acting like a chorchnabe.
It's not squealed, it's not squealed, it's squealed at most.
Especially for this restraint, often misunderstood as a clinginess, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dancers
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythms, as shown in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, fired by the players.
The Mexican second leaguer had defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last Minute Pleit "Destructed on the Ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball leaguer ASV Send, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat". His guards were "damaged on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - the fourth - in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played bad over long periods - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've totally slept," the ASV trainer became annoyed.
The houselords quickly led with 8:1, even the early period that Bieletzki had taken did not at first fruit.
"But then suddenly a ruck passed through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the residue was only two goals.
Especially the broadcast's best, Marius Hintze, met one other time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from the point of view of visitors.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst finished at 15:15, and then the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Interact with the impartials in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, at the back also stood well against seven men and threw again and again at the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there must be a fucking victory," said Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlödl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pole (2).
Hitchhiking (1).
Bayern: Missing woman for 30 years - Police digging for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila County Hof, the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, emergency workers dug up a road at Marxgrün.
To this end, the road surface and several layers of it were taken off, as the police and prosecutors jointly reported.
According to new findings, the missing person may not have been buried far away from his home.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators didn't rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court and the Public Prosecutor's Office have been working intensively on the case again.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the investigators used a ground radar to push the street under Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials bordered the scene to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be disclosed during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are lurking in the web.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts online.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the US stock exchange supervisor SEC added out-of-court disputes over misleading Twitter news, in which Musk could have lost permission to lead listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per year, and Musk gives up the Chairman's office for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
He may remain the head of the board of directors.
In comparison, which has to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrong conduct.
The SEC had sued the world-famous manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also runs SpaceX space company, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now rated at the stock exchange by more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk explained that he had done nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed in the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter supporters that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing was secured.
Tesla would have been rated at $72 billion in total.
Later Musk rowed back: Tesla stay on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an external Chairman, appoint two independent members of the Executive Board and also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel as chancellor until 2021
After the questionnaires of the past weeks, the GroKo collects several polls.
The SPD falls back in an interview behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has rehearsed the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the first time in Germany on Sunday.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
With this in mind, the great coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
The government parties consistently reach 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allebach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestag elections, they received 53.4 percent.
For the other parties the band is also large: The AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of the votes.
But the support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also fallen significantly since the Bundestag elections in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right one in the law firm, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wants the large coalition to hold until the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, marked popularity losses for Merkel had been seen.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should be running again for the CDU Presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are against it, 44 percent are against it.
Thus, 64 percent of the Union's supporters want a candidate, 35 percent do not.
Exhibit at Aldi: Price reduced to happiness of love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says, in times of tinkers, there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - he should talk to Aldi about puten meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as an acquaintance place for great love almost radiates anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pudding meat, boxer short snacks at the vault table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swing to the right.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a slippery stock exchange.
We risked the test: How do women react, and they don’t talk about the hot breeze for long in the first news?
Here's the amazing result.
It has a real Hollywood-lovestory potential when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eye-lost and-recovered plot.
If the guy even reports with his adored one at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an Aldi-Fiiliale unknown to us that she will also want to find her Tra Álion, with whom she has briefly talked about the "30 percent reduced organic meat" .
For the belief in the magic of analog know-how, she definitely earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Bilderbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has participated in the action "Deck against Polio - 500 lids for a life without children's paralysis".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polioviruses.
The disease, described in German as child paralysis, leads from paralysis to death.
In Germany, Polio is considered to have been eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be contained by vaccinations so far, as a press release says.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand tranquility for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to public discussion about Mario Götze's form and fitness.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that doesn't do us any good," said the god-friended Reus after the 4:2 win in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Soccer: Eberl: Don't rush into negotiations with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from the football league player Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no hurry with a possible extension of the contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract yet.
There's no fixed date when we do that.
"But there will certainly be the moment when we sit down and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening in the TV station Sky.
Soccer: District League: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court hard with his men.
He, the coach of VfL Wolbeck's football district leaguer, first withdrew (inwardly) in order to sense the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it runs again on the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Proof is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, during the past season only thinly swept past the ascent.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up everyone for the game to simply say "thank you" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes waited in front of the balls.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his departure (17th), who replaced Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been feared when the SCA hit the Wolbecker Box twice in person in minute 41 by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his profession.
After the break, the VfL frequently took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed barely.
Schroer also arrived too late after 58 minutes with a Thewes input.
With the inflection of Miles Geske, the left side of the fetch missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release for the placekeepers 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The foul himself entered and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slip hit the bottom left from the point of view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
20 more minutes, they should be damn long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck in the 80th minute the leather in the penalty room unfortunately flew to hand.
Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm), a referee, immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the winner on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Maybe it was too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
The starting point: Four points after five game days - that was not enough for Trainer Adi Hütter.
In the end, the first Heimsieg to win against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt.
Stürmer Ante Rebic, who was in the startelf for the first time after an injury, should help.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
At the landing it was still an accident on the airfield.
The four occupants were slightly injured.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn there was a drama.
The landing of a helicopter resulted in turbulence, as confirmed by the police against oe24.
The Heli was captured by a gust of wind, power on the ground and came to rest on the side.
Police, rescue, and fire department were immediately agreed upon.
With a big bid, the forces came to the scene of the accident.
The ÖAMTC-Notarzth helicopter was also called to be careful.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage to the property.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to return home on their own.
The precise circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject of the investigations.
According to firefighter Franz Resperger, there was a small fire, which, however, could quickly be wiped out again.
Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate management
This meant that only 8 percent of the executives were female on September 1st, as the report "The Power of Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and the German press agency was ahead of schedule.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said the Foundation Managing Director Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, purely male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - have long since been unthinkable.
The backlog makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It's a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchanges was also due only to positive impulses in the medium-sized values index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value had remained at 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years pioneers - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last time 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will be recruiting consistent women again next year - in their own interest," said Anchorsen.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is from the Supervisory Boards: On September 1st, the share of women was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Every year the number of women recruited for the board of directors would have reached a 40 percent share in 2023," says the report.
Some even make mixes: luxury car body: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
It's the best Ferrari deserves.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most win per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and business professor Ferdinand Dudenhoffer have been working on this question.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made 69,000 Euro operating profits in the first half of the year with each car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes to around 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on it with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices from an average of 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Torch for the opening of the 60th Abtswind wine festival
With a torch train, the tourist club opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the club will host the wine festivals, which will continue every Saturday in October in the large festive tent on Rehweiler Straße.

The chairman of the Tourist Society, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests in the already bulging festival tent. "60 years of this kind – this is an insanity for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Later, wine princess Lisa II symbolically ran off with the guests from the stage.
"Good that so many have found their way back to us after Abtswind." Later, "The Troggles" caused mood.
On Sunday, on which the abbotswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago on the occasion of the anniversary in the afternoon.
A feast evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before it takes place one day later in the party tent in the second round.
In Bonn: emergency car power in taxi
An emergency car is heavily damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old passantine was fatally injured in the collision of the operating vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best even save human lives.
Such a rescue took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in the collision of an emergency car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had passed a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met on a crossroads with the taxi that drove by green.
After the collision, the doctor’s car threw a lamppost and a tree.
He captured the passanthin who died at the site of the accident.
Driver of the emergency car and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the emergency car driver were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from emergency workers.
The severely injured 29-year-old emergency doctor was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another called emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonn Public Prosecutor's Office, determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we tirelessly
After the blamable Out in the league, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United Manu is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat should still give way to speaking.
The scene was symbolic in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester defenders remained standing, leaving Arnautovic all the time in the world to shoot the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative peak of a previously far-reaching lack of performance.
At present, the mood is very different with Uniteds city rival Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's big competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2:0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team for the first time broke the defense bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalie, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool No More Table Leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the league, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the cup-off, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained the only match of the game until the end of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slug.
So after the Reds started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the Cup, and due to the remis in the league, the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 win.
The fans of the Gunners, with Granit Xhaka playing through, had to resist the surprise team from Hertfordshire until the 81st minute on a success report.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily pushed Alex Iwobi into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, Arsenal passed Watford and is now right behind the big rival Tottenham in rank 5. A strong impression continues to be left under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and won 8th place.
VW brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no subject and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
From next week at the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showing their innovations together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, should nevertheless be an important topic at least behind the brilliant scenes of the trade fair booths.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: The Ingolstadt etron is to be launched at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Officially, however, both were presented.
The iNext of BMW is only due to start in 2021.
The new 3rd is at the centre of Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, well over a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have been killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens of people are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and traffic connections are damaged, there was enormous damage to property.
After the quake, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach in the coastal town of Palu.
It is feared that the number of victims is still clearly increasing.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, there are also numerous other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
About 150 Bikers Celebrate Worship in Werdoohl
Motorbike Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final divine service for motorcyclists at the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a team of helpers.
Werdoohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle god service (MoGo) takes place at the house Nordhellen.
The finale of the season is traditionally celebrated at the Peace Church in Eveking.
There on Sunday about 150 bikers had gathered to do anything but ordinary worship.
As early as 10 a.m., the Bolidens were placed in front of the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the biker-breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a cool curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were present.
The sermon held during the biker diocese of Pastor Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical undertone.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues skirt, Valerie Lill rather beats poetically quiet tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle god service yesterday.
Vouchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big feast: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astounding audience step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big funnels.
With a little muscle power, a finely crushed mass was removed from the apples.
Not many of the children could imagine how it was to be a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important step of work on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered with nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the little pieces of apple for layering over each other, which look like hedgehog.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
However, the village farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkatte" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in moisture village" was high accordingly.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built-up Hüpfburg for themselves.
Active of the Vouchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited them to play short-lived games at some stations.
In the coming year too, the Heimatverein will offer an action day.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the issue on hand: eventually it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season run: "Besesee Situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 to talk to them with courage.
There was a lot of positive things to be seen before at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football pro Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "This is obviously disappointing, because you always do a lot of things."
The further victorious Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met for connection, stand with two counters at the very bottom and are in their present constitution a candidate for descent.
Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first victory of the season, led by Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached the gates of the DFB Cup winner before 46,300 spectators, who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never to get caught by Hanover's defense.
The stormer, long struck after the World Cup, showed with his speed and perseverance why he is so valuable to the harmony.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, loaned by Liverpool FC, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, which began swinging.
Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball was falsified on the gate network for the first time.
Six minutes later Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96-defence of the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership of the masters fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic raised the ball to a defensive corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head in front of the gate, where Ndicka only had to keep his foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the French second-ligist AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who gasped himself skillfully and left 96-tort Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hanover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxonys played a little more courageous forwards, they remained inflamed until the end, when the connecting hit was still successful.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid across De Guzmán, who had only to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overcrowded guests, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Swirling Despite cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city center.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter managed to do so before millions of audiences at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two beatings.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross celebration on 14 September or on Sunday thereafter.
The festival service takes place in the city church, and then is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final stage.
The Church of the Holy Cross houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and on whom the legend must have shot a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gunshot wound.
From this developed a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross church.
This is still not finished, only the altar room is standing, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite the importance for the Geisinger parish, the ministry was badly visited.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross church took place and with the final victory, the ecclesiastical part of the crucifixion ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish to the secular part of the festival.
The choir members supplied the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and the weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish church offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After some time the scaffolding had been in place, the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual tenders prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has become bigger, but more has been found, which was only possible by the in-eye removal by scaffolding.
The plating of the plating is completed, before the winter is due to begin with the natural stone works and one hopes to complete well half of these works this year.
Inauguration: New residence in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life support Donau-Iller opens a new residential home for people with disabilities on Münsterblickstraße.
That on the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destination - there were all those present at the inauguration date agreed.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users, who have been living in the home of the life support Donau-Iller for some time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer's building was put on the test stand for the residents with cell phone cap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators pulled up to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Life support Danube-Iller opens new residence
About 4.6 million euros invested life support in the new building.
The Free State allocated EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - both in time and in financial terms.
He was also thanked by the managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz.
The space between a barrier-free and fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allows the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile".
The housing and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The real estate in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer possible to acquire it in the present situation".
In total, the new residential home on the Münsterblickstraße offers space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
He is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed by collective agreement.
Germany: Switzerland complains of differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the vice-chairman of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, called on all the countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt unit after almost 30 years.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "Day Mirror on Sunday".
The goal had to remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans, on average, worked longer than the people in Western Germany, but they earn 15 percent less.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this plastery dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjongyang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two dogs about a year old reached their receiver already on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to "make it easier for the animals".
The dogs with the thick white coat, pointed ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The charity was announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pjongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to apply together for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, which usually answer this question in retrospect of the past hundred years.
In a very different way, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Picture Book" Austria, will be published on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to the work in hand - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition beginning today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not last name the "return to concrete work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and work, but be it so.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its mission again - the government - it should not be held off now with debates on terms.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blubbers of the last weeks, may already show Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government meet at the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to clear up conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are once again conflicting issues on the agenda with the diesel retrofitting and the labour migration law.
CSU-Verkehrsminister Scheuer wants to let the car companies with exchange premiums smile away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel.
While there has been an approach in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned labour migration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum seekers working or training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "change of track" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be another dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without dispute, a society so diverse and sometimes conflicting does not advance.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be reconstructed for party-tactical reasons on the question of being or not being.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and useful to many?
With this key question you can pragmatically clarify both the diesel and the switch-over question - and thus regain confidence.
That is why the people's parties must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visitor
Is the Minister of Labour in breach of the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" had worked on the social security reform, reported a superfluous social minister in the presentation two weeks ago.
With List Pilz-Mandater Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament via question.
She assumed that "the Minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the deployment of her team and not in any way to proclaim violations of applicable service law in front of current cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "absolve" Har of any suspicion.
Police are tearing a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Lange did not want the police to comment on this.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been dug.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgreen until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters together with its leader in multi-use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the top Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year now, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Criminal Police Court have been handling the case of a missing person.
Time and again, a cycle path was blocked at Marxgrün and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that here in the course of the new construction of the Staatsstraße, Heike's body could have been sharpened 30 years ago.
Coloring powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already coming to Krawallen.
The separatists did not forget the autumn 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there was a clash between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked, among other things, by the independence advocates with colour powder when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a rally that took place last year at the referendum that was considered illegal in the polls.
When it came to trying to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces apart, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6,000 separatists would then have violently tried to break through the police chain, and the officials among other things threw color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested, 24 more had been slightly injured, called upon the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had made Catalonia compulsory in autumn 2017.
At the time, regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
Several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, the new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the Forced Administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra is also based on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Soccer: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected delinquency: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separates torlos
Red-and-white ahlen continues on the spot.
Even at the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0-undecided.
The final light and the third-last they came out before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered perplexity.
The first half was easily manageable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who preferred to get a beer or a sausage could do so without concern.
There was no danger of missing a torch because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Güterslohs Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only real - possibility had been for the Achleners when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the border of punishment.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for whom Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something about the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed 18 metres across the housing, and after an hour the Gütselsloher first appeared offensively.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went fast.
The quickly presented account about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but a lazy shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they laid down with a headball of Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball of the former alder Tim Manstein.
RWA Interim Trainer Angelo Daut responded, initially brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It caused - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners failed to achieve.
It was not until the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they did not bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to strike out the positive: "I like that we played to zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood at the front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against wooden wickede, and this although our opponent didn't want to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer noted.
Offensively, "everything was a bit of a platter" against a team, "who only wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel like we could get a counter door," said Daut.
As an audience, however, one did not feel as if his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Ernthankmarkt: Luckily, there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition, for which these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was brightly blue, the space was still a little empty, but that should change throughout the day.
Because, "Here it's so nice to meet you, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent pinch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term.
The Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the "replacement" did not allow itself to entertain musically the more and more visitors.
This was so good that later some folk songs were sung.
"Just great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many active people with their stalls, including mostly clubs.
"Actually, there shouldn't be something like a board at all," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also included the other festivals and the "Clean Up" action that took place in September.
Our garden town has a colorful coat - here's what goes on.
Then the Maikranz was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire brigade and taken to the winter quarter.
Many stalls have been worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupier saw.
Furnace work, beer lid with Reckenfelder motifs and much more he had in offer.
Three Reckenfelder Beimkers offered a specialty: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought with them by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluster.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, so good the cake tasted.
It is the company that allowed visitors to stay for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political message: No successful advertising for skates
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably recruited in a hard-to-reward way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubrications, says Jürgen Kohne of the City Administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal proceedings have been brought against the police for damage to property.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were used on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, a corresponding letter had already been discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message had apparently been left "only" with anadding at the time, it could have been removed easily.
"A few days later, however, it was back there again, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding billboard must be replaced.
A particular note is given in this particular case by the fact that on the board also several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned.
If the skate system is built, its implementation should also be made possible by sponsors.
Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department School, Sport and Culture, explains his promise without mentioning any name.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies standing on the dirty table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skating facilities.
After the old one had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative site began.
Finally, the Council expressed itself in favour of the fire station.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to speak against a construction at this point.
At the end of June a turnaround followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word then belongs to the City Council.
He assumes a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be held.
Engpass in air traffic control is getting even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German air traffic controllers see no sign of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," said Matthias Maas, head of the aviation security union, the German press agency in front of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures was the long-known lack of staff in European air navigation services, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new pilots takes four to five years," said the trade unionist.
In Europe, the market for fully trained pilots was empty.
Alone in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hanseatic City on Friday, representatives of the Federal Republic, the countries, air traffic control, airlines and airports will meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work densification and overtime, this will not work without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Federal Air Safety Agency.
Maas again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen-Misers.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting costs and staff savings in the national air navigation services are now fully dependent on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to use regulations in Brussels that do not "shut the air even further" the air.
At present, EU regulations would be voted on by 2024 and further tightening would be to be feared.
The EU was under constant lobbying pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they themselves have sown in recent years," said Maas.
He hoped that the high delay costs would lead to a rethinking of the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Aviation Administration (DFS) offers a "consistent training and future pact", said Maas.
The previously announced admission of 120 pilots per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related declines.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group conversion
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to restructure the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Manager Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board at the Sunday meeting, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in Essen and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff cut beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
However, the final decision is expected to be taken by a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to include among other things the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by policemen and Catalan independence supporters.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona have had violent confrontations with many victims.
According to the City Administration, about 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, and some 6,000 independent supporters demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a big offer to keep the two marches away from each other.
According to the personnel, however, independence advocates have repeatedly tried to break through the security barrier.
They would have attacked the officers with paint and shots.
According to the rankings, there were also indications between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to data from rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there had been six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who had taken action almost a year ago against the Spanish Central Government's report on independence in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was provocative that the Spanish police protested in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked 55-year-old Catalan protestor Manel Perez of the AFP news agency.
Just in order to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've thwarted us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, refuted the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to British Minister's personal data
A vulnerability to a mobile app has led to the personal data of ministers and members of the Conservative British Tory Party being temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the panic became known one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.
Two people stuck on B217
On Sunday morning, the police in Hanover reported a serious traffic accident on Bundesstraße 217, Hamelner Chaussee, at the exit of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when they drove their car against a tree.
The car is currently in flames.
The personnel are on site.

Football: Juve Trainer Praises by Top: Ronaldos Best Game
The Portuguese Star Stormer has "played the best game together with the half hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought star was also without its own goal the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and it's good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three goals by Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retardation through the hits of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst persecutor for the first time.
The goal hunter picked up by Real Madrid initially posted the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26./49.).
And Ronaldo also did the preliminary work on the hit of Defense Chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had only to slide in just before the goalline.
"He gives many templates," the coach praised.
But Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record goalie.
"We have to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve torch shooter is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With Ronaldo's purchase for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' supremacy seems to be getting even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the past seven years already has six counters lead on Naples.
The table width, trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the deportation of the already warned Mario Rui (58th), the top part was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the place after too hard.
"We played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional who came from FC Liverpool was in use at all seven league parties.
The middlefield actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri said with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown out of the place at the 2:0 win of the Turiner and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a particularly hilarious appearance, Rapper Kanye West gave attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Amongst other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for forehead curls and question marks at the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Ye", according to the musician.
"The being formerly known as Kanye West," he twittered in agreement with the late singer Prince when he gave his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is no news.
The tenth album was already released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Soccer: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
That's it!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage made no hay out of his disappointment.
That was a weak game of ours today.
The opponent was just more gripping, we've put him in trouble as well as never before." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmar's shots read out thinly.
Grades times two torch chances in 90 minutes, so you can rarely make games positive.
Soccer-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar submits SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first pass, the first but used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preliminary work by Krause he changed his mind.
The hosts had only a double opportunity when Moritz Höne failed to make his shoemaker to Torsteher Jos and also found his master in the posthumous Jan Blome in the sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved by hand on the goalline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann could also not use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81.).
"We had been critical of each other before, and that was different today from the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7,), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th/Hoetmar).
Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he was saying.
"We have no access to them at all." With that he probably meant the wing pliers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who came up with collective openness.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, wavering boldly and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled themselves out of the affair with three points.
It is well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we oppose one of the top teams of the league over the entire playing time, that was really phenomenal."
All the more bitter it seems that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top-Torhunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts in the lead with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He placed the 2:0 above the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't take out a player like that completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski admitted the opponent's quality without envy.
Shortly before the change of sides, his own eleven succeeded in balancing: McGill's free shot from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long toreck (45.).
After the change of sides it was McGill again who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked Albachten (64), only five minutes later like Patrick Horstmann (69).
Despite the excess, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia meeting (80th).
We must now focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheepskins, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24), 2:0 Spring (39), 2:1 McGill (45), 2:2 McGill (59), 3:2 Nübel (64), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74/Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and the game ended with 0:0.
Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire Bureau of Soccer-Zweiligist Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media in the evening called for a joint letter from the Saxony-based body.
The association was initially not confirmed.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Bundesligist.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there.
So Udo Hahn, director of the Academy, proudly said, "All the federal presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That the Academy at the Tutzing Castle repeatedly showed up prominently, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmaker Konstantin Wecker took part in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective.On 29 September, writer Frido Mann attended a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to receive the "tolerance Prize" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid-2019 have been held.
"The pension is not safe!" is a conference title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risky and deadly route over the Mediterranean".
"And to a conference on Syria: "Barbarei without Limit".
Arm deals, destruction, torture, death - the war detests every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the separation between the poor and the rich to the radical change of work through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Akademie-Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting held on 200.
Karl Marx's birthday shortly awaits a more visitor of the direction of capitalism-criticism, the others rather a tendency "from the outside to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret girl, Teubner pretended gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) man and what else may exist, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered its violin.
Ben Süverkrup was sitting on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes also comes to the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanies Sükörp Teubner that some may have wished for a solo.
There was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it fit the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had put a paradox into play: the satisfaction comes with the man, if he has a partner, but he does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does no good.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart's composition had "the Nannerl" opened the door unexpectedly?
So Süverkrup glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "song of death", and from Mozart's g minor symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea of enjoying the duo next to appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt also one in Wolbeck.

Bruchsal.
After a bus accident at the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
Ten passengers were slightly injured instead of fifteen.
Everyone was released from the hospital by now.
The French bus driver had stayed at the hospital for one night to observe.
He was released during the day, said a spokesperson of the police.
The cause of the long-distance bus accident at Bruchsal was still unclear.
The Fernbus was unbraked frontal against a guideboard on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women's Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenes had problems with third-party player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many goals.
We didn't catch them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the finals left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end behind a residue, lay at the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) at the back.
Only in the end did the wider bank of the hostesses become decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu set back room Merle Klement on the left, which then made "extreme clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV Ostbevern in the top game at the VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league West.
The Blue-Whites won with 3:1 at the 2ndliga-departer VC Allbau Essen.
"It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked out this," said Trainer Dominik Münch, looking forward to an almost impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost as desired.
He went over 4:1, 16:10, and 22:12 to the vice-masters of the year before.
Food was accepted in the double bar, but did not come into play.
We did a good job of them.
Our opponent has posted high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "Essen has changed the acceptance to three-line.
We couldn't keep the impact pressure.
Eating has been rank-sucking, and we've let ourselves get a little fooled in," Münch continues.
At 18:17 the volleyballers from the Ruhr area had the nose at the front.
In 19:24, Ostbevern refused four more balls, but the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a better class," was the trainer to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we have played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White passed through four with 25:22 brought on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also achieved a great day.
BSV women: Egg house, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Mosque opening as missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way in which the large Ditib mosque was inaugurated in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a cluster of shards that can only be worked together," said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network in Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the opportunity for a joint, conciliatory appearance.
"In addition to stressing the Muslim affiliation to Germany with top German politicians, Erdogan has used the date for his purposes," lamented Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public had "enforced many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: offer has already established
After the long summer break is finally again folk hit time.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already organises its fifth emergency folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it's been a year since we had a folk meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottul Heimatverein.
I didn't think our folk hit would be in emergency eta so quickly.
No matter if Sturmtief Friederike in January or heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"As always, the program at the next folk meeting is a colorful mix of German folk songs, folk songs, folk songs, evergreens and old beats," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends of musicians over and over to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged with his accordion for his first "birthday".
He was a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from the Steinfurt neighborhood, who played music with flat-screen German lyrics.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The folk hit makers remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the folk hit Emsdetten enthusiastically sent the listeners home with an earworm with his international version of the song "Frösche at night".
"We expect many happy guests to spend a pleasant and humorous evening again," says the invitation of the home association.
Those who play an instrument and want to be actively involved are invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always quickly occupied, it is recommended to be there in time.
The folk meeting starts at 7.30 p.m., but admission is already at 7 p.m.
China approved planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are on their way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority approved the proposed merger, informed Linde on Sunday.
As a result, the permits in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still valid for the billion-dollar merger.
Last but not least, there had improved the chances of an insider's consent because Linde had agreed to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit-growing to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year anniversary of the district association for horticulture and land care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a big anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
At that time, however, he was called a different name: as "Kummbach City and Land District Fruit Building Association", he was baptised by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was actually just about fruit-making, about flowers and horticulture no one thought at the time.
"At that time, at the time of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his lecture.
Fruit trees should line up long-distance roads, so-called industrial gardens have been built in schools.
Obstan construction is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural horticulture, biological plant protection, village beauties and nutrition play an equally important role as the dissemination of knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Mulwörfe" showed how versatile the areas of work of a horticultural association are.
"Young people's work is urgently needed especially in the digital age," said Günter Reif, district chairman, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of life's experiences in nature.
The chestnut collection was a big deal for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & co. you can gain a similar amount of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the Kreisverband decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district also left no doubt about it to the district managers and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He conducted the many visitors with an image lecture through the long history of the Kreisverband and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was ingested.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the garden had turned into a ornamental and residential garden.
"The nature has existed, it was already there before us and we have to orient ourselves to it," the expert for fruit and nut trees pleaded.
Therefore, give the horticultural associations the incentive not to leave behind so that our home stays beautiful and worth living.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens in our clubs, the president of the Bavarian national association Wolfram Vaitl added.
"We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, which we owe to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Mülf the successful celebration, which was solemnly framed by the towers of the Thurnau Music Society.

Priority for Naphta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister is publishing UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on the matter of Naphta: you represent both trading partners as an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's foreign minister now gives the trade agreement absolute priority - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the pressure of time in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today’s Saturday, the minister would not speak until Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, it focuses on the renegotiation of Naphta.
On Friday, Mexican economic minister Ildefonso Guajardo had declared that Canada's negotiators and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to accede to the trade agreement already reached between its country and the United States.
The United States and Mexico agreed in August on a new version of the Naphta regional free trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Naphta in the future.
The talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s appointed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential Candidate Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro after a report of the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on the open road at the beginning of September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brazilian cities thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") women's associations called for protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, too, the associations made racist and womanly statements against Bolsonaro.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia the protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to run.
The Presidential elections in Brazil will take place on 7 October.
As ex-citer of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was in polls far behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump Brazil" has long been involved in the politics business, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate reaches the absolute majority in the first round of the elections, there will be a election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is well-known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and his glory in the military dictatorship (1964-85).
Again and again he shocks with verbal derailments.
Another time he said that Lula's left workers' party was to be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen announced on Larsen's website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on the deathbed.
The musician had been in treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become known with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the release of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His album "Midt om Nacht" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
On Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Löcke Rasmussen honoured Larsen in a statement as a "street boy", who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had performed on the 70th birthday of the Danish queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknacht in the Schuhfabrik: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger."The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hard rock of three with another friendly band.
After the sound check and just before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly announce the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the CD that will appear soon.
In front of the stage, the band is danced for the vocal and expressive interaction.
Although "additional" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock is demonstrated by guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer for guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost balladish "Take Me Home" impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-stretched rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishäuschen has been playing a special level of fame since its foundation in 2005.
Full agility on Saturday the band presents their hard rock.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 Tour in China - has special stage experience is obvious and insurmountable.
In conjunction with the band, singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann sets his own accents in the only covert song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound that was even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a cheery solo while he runs through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to a genre due to such a hard rock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixing board team, the trio concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is at the level of press hammers, but it is still clearly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitval" that point to the "The Ignition" on their website.
The audience of Achlen doesn't need to hear 120 decibels in jet fuel volume as usual in the North of the Republic, as is the case with the annual Metal-Stelldichene.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rocky gait have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can say all three groups, in the transferred sense, at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A dead person in a sailplane accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident has occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A sailplane crashed on Sunday in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport of Mülheim/Essen, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" reports, a sailplane crashed at the trade fair car park at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" continues to say, the flight student was on board alone - the pilot is supposed to be a passenger.
The plane was already on its landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just a short distance from the airport.
But since this weekend, a Oktoberfest has been taking place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr towns and directly on the way to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events in the fair Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump skyrockets Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that U.S. President North Korea's ruler Kim is perfectly sound despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
She also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has become known as a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a long distance relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
In front of followers in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old spross of the ruling dynasty from Pjongiang, although it turns out to be quite tough in the struggle around North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was very hard, so was he, and between us it went back and forth," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, these were great letters.
Her personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip certificates.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - whether he was notorious for his martyrdom - should not be every memory, seemed to be quite aware of the US President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large sports hall in Wheeling City immediately in advance: "Donald Trump says they fell in love".
How terrible is that?
It's so unpresidual.
But he took care of it very little, said Trump and then pointed his index finger to the crowd: "I have always told you it is so easy to be presidential".
But then out there, we wouldn't push 10,000 people into this crowded arena, but we'd only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens is visited, atmospherically and above all spoiled by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair Baesweiler's city center was put out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest not only took place in the Festzelt at the fire tower, but was extended by the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued from Libyan Prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous conditions of detention in Libya with the help of a mobile video, thus enabling them to be rescued.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Savivia in July under threat of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video he put himself in danger after his own statement.
One of his fellow warriors was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of detention had been disastrous: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home with the help of the programme this year, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians was not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone video help call yet.
International organizations have long criticised the conditions in Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.

Germans were caught in their own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a middle-franken forest area after driving the car off all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing one since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
According to the report, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and for a long time without care.
He indicated that he was looking forward to his home.
The pensioner had been reported as missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his off-road car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search efforts, the man's remains had remained unclear for days.
Laschet urges the rule of law in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to state the law in Turkey according to his own information.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This was mainly about arrest waves, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to become normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that rule of law is a very important condition for this".
According to his own information, Laschet also referred to the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan had been moved to a short-term building of the German Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
Originally it had to take place at Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected this from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan traveled on to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country".
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea claims disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of negotiations on North Korea's denuclearisation, the East Asian regime is more sobering.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's relief.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula at the UN General Debate with its continuing sanctions.
"The latest downfall is therefore that the US is building on coercive measures that are deadly to build trust," said Ri in New York.
Disarmament was unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first person," said the North Korean chief diplomat.
The fact that North Korea could force sanctions on the knees is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, Ri stressed that his country had stopped his nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility.
However, there were no "corresponding reactions" from the US side, the minister criticised.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and rocket program, the UN Security Council had decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country on its own last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been pressing the United Nations for strict compliance with sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump met North Korea's ruler Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President aims for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel again to Pjöngiang to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the open door HoT got nothing: White blankets and flower decorations on the tables and a big buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest thanks-god service.
The young people of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves with the food.
The start of the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the bad surprise on the first day after the summer break: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone got involved.
The result could be seen, the guests were excited.
"Better can't cook either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to use Quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the kids and young people have put on their feet," stressed pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen with map tricks and other art pieces caused amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen Table, Jörg Sartor, has given his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice President of the NRW Boards, said Sartor the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen in the back of too many people.
The head of the Board-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-standing deputy.
Sartor took the sharp criticism.
"I can understand his step - there have been people who didn't know exactly why the dining table is doing this."
Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other boards in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city starve."
It is up to the state to ensure that people did not starve.
The Essener did not attend a congress of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet face being told to me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that have criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch Play 2:0 Tour - Gmünder Tagepost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after arrears - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clear.
At 2:0, Lorch was already in the lead in the home game against the TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
The TV Heuchlingen was quite different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly disappeared with 0:1 but after 90 minutes won with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to do so with a 3:0.
Gladbach Plays Two-time Guided Tour - Schalke Without Embolo With First Victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play twice a tour.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season win (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games, Schalke has maneuvered to the outside with early counterparts.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco once again laid that strength on the day with which it had won the first place behind Bavaria in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the homeequipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparatory work by Evgeni Konoplánka by head, in which the hosts subsequently preserved the minipadded with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an exceptional comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre's team had negotiated a 0:2-return against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the 2nd half of the time it still won the 4:2-reward.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, with another doublet in the final phase (86/94.) ensured the crowning conclusion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first win.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters were afraid of the fact that werder Bremen was decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curiose enthusiast owner who helped the guests in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro took the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a guided tour twice, played 2:2 and have been waiting for an exit victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's balance to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal ligator.
Yann Sommer was powerless in the flat shoot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, as was the second one after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa appears as a goalgetter in the storm of foals.
The French record purchase was made for the third consecutive time by OGC Nice against Wolfsburg and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven laps Gladbach takes fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen moved against VfB Stuttgart in an untiring position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart account that the ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first season hit, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: 23-year-old Serbe collected after a jersey cup against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to the game by a curiose enthusiast owner (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters, who were overnumbered, back to the Siegesstrasse.
Nürnberg chose the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team on course using Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether the name of their country should be changed in northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades-long conflict with the neighbour of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had existed on a change of name because of its eponymous northern province and had blocked every approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Acids in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
An Syrian brutally beat three pensioners and thereby hurt them severely.
On Friday, 41-year-old asylum seekers rang around the escape street in Alsergrund.
When the police came in, they spoke to the accused, who started with clasped fists on passersby and tried to attack them on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
Some time later it turned out that the suspect had just struck three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the Währinger Street at a tram stop.
He had also stepped the trio with his feet.
In part, the pensioners were severely injured.
They suffered haematoma, concussions and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also severely injured "for an unknown reason," as the police called it.
He was brought to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the Yesword.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" magazine.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on June 30, 2017.
So he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "staggered" himself on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Civil Society Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Citizen's Association.
And there have been so many gatherings.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a shape cut.
Because already in spring they shaved the hedge once.
The breakfast which is always followed by the work has also a long tradition.
"Everyone should stay strong," said Walter Schröer.
World Cup in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he missed the Olympic Bridge at three hundredths of an hour.
I was well prepared, had already had enough rides here on the site and it has all been right today," said the third Olympia of London in 2012.
In the goal he threw away his paddle for joy and stretched both arms to the height confidently - knowing that it would be at least enough for a medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't top his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec became second to the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting Police Inspectorate mentioned the first attempt to break into a family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - that's what burglars want to make use of.
This was how the Gauting Police Inspectorate mentioned yesterday's first attempt to break in this fall.
The alarm system is due to the fact that it remained at the one-family house on Königswieser Strasse during the test.
It started when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The intruders knew that the inhabitants were not at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they took refuge without any prey.
Information to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleasure at Hertha: From the reality: Bayern called against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin "does not want to be dropped" by FC Bayern.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small power station under the new coach Niko Kovac is not to increase for the Munichers to the larger autumn low.
"A week ago, you had the impression, we're invincible.
Now we have a little caught up in reality," Thomas Müller noted after the earned 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this is really annoying to us and that is why we are giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal of its own, like at the same time of the previous season, two compulsory games in series without victory, lost the leadership in the football league to Borussia Dortmund for the first time.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-against tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches over the outside have delivered just two blue breaks within three days, as the last overwhelming Bavarias are to crack.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to get back to success," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he changed with his losers in his native town surprisingly gently and only pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach on the once again flawed handling of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first intermediate conclusion of his term of office a positive one, otherwise the tone would probably get worse.
Thus Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second king-class appearance of this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-run game against Ajax, which had also conquered Athens sovereignly with 3:0 for the start AEK.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost pokal finale against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke plain text in particular.
The legal defender acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think this is all bad, we have to work it out again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old just before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bavarians were even with five counters behind Dortmund, which now took the lead again with a point lead.
And so Kimmich at least appreciated positively with an eye wink that now the public debate on the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in shot line: Özil-Cauza: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious accusations, Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the line of engagement.
A new post should now be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the high degree of interpretation in the long-term struggle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany for opening the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced consequences from the causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U teams - that something is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as further integration representatives.
At the same time, Grindel again stated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
In sharp words, he had denounced a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown-up Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had to take photographs with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Cathedral City.
To be honest, as their president, I could not digest the fact that our two young men, who had ascended to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gundogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonable about the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which the two had begun with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced his intention to face players in the future.
That someone says, when I win, I'm German, when I lose, I'm a migrant - that's not possible.
"I am very sorry that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for the return of Özil to the national team.
As a result, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, an additional integrator is to be appointed.
"If a person is clearly involved in society and football without any migration background and says, "The issue is important, then we have to take care of it", that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our clubs on the ground where integration must work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for office as DFB President next year.
"I do my job and try to make them as good as I can," said Grindel.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10am and 13pm.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the area of Lauter Höhe.
He told the pensioner that he had driven against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange since the 75-year-old woman could not find the lady in the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had come off the road and driven against a guidepost.
Speaking of which, the man did not want a police officer on the spot and was then driven away.
After that, the Rödentaler went home.
However, the pensioner has been in his hometown, where he has lived for decades, and has been driving a construction vehicle at the turn.
Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car showed significant damage to the accident.
The 75-year-old made a weird impression and couldn't think of much more.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 operational personnel in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a German military site in Emsland, 980 workers are still employed in the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
Since the situation of a speaker is still stable, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of staff was planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an above ground fire had been discovered and erased.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was well proclaimed a week earlier on 21 September, because it was feared that the flames would put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was then said that an attack of the fire on neighboring communities no longer threatens.
At times, more than 1,500 operatives tried to control the fire on the ground.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with German Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, for the 2nd and 5th of October "Tornados" are also planned again.
The fire had been triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had temporarily moved up to a hundred kilometers across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday owners.
SPD Politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage came into force for all, the politician married his long-standing friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost one year after the marriage came into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two of them gave themselves the Yesword.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" magazine.
If we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesperson of the SPD Bundestag faction and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim district, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening up of marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused an outrage on June 30, 2017.
So he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "staggered" himself on the subject.
"That was your Shabowski moment," he referred to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the adoption right.
referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the anticipated referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Some 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its northern province of the neighbour of Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote in favour, they also give the start to the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The aim of the register is to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with explicit consent, emphasizes Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in case of death can register there.
Your wishes are then available in case of a Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent, emphasizes Swiss transplant.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss citizens have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment with possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You will then have to make a representative decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," always says.
There is a similar system of registration already in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokesman of the Federal Centre for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - per or versus organ donation," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted in favour of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, each person would be considered an organ donor, unless he or she disagrees with him or her.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headcount
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the head count.
He competed against 39 rivals on weekends in Wolfsburg.
The Martina Flame-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the venue for the competition, announced on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüße from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of whom was a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as major referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants attended against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings were in Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
With terms such as super brain, genius, or miracle child, organizers can do little with Laue.
"Headcount can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square rooting of six-digit numbers.
When calculating versatility, the candidates get surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here, too, the Germans have good opportunities, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often to the advantage, because there are more intensive and effective methods there in early childhood.
Intrusive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown by her emotional and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make himself strong for early detection.
It's about life and death, but it's also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" by the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their intimateest places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died of this.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which deals with breast cancer early detection that can save life.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency surgery was initiated to save the baby's life.
A subsequent CT detected blood clots in Serena's lung.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law" in review.
This will significantly extend the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will be shaking her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polare Kaltluft reaches Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters with a strong intensity.
From Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, it is expected that the new snow will be 20 to 40 centimeters above 2,000 metres.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjö, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege on Monday
On Monday, Schleswig-Holstein's farmers are allowed to start the annual Knickpflege.
For some 200 years, the unique "green whales" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor federal state.
The tree and shrub hedges up to five metres wide are "forest set" and the last retreat rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks combine as corridors scattered habitats, over which the exchange of organisms can still function, as said the Managing Director of the German Nature Conservation Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field-limiting and livestock fences, they also supplied the farmer with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time his name "Knick" is also derived: By "circling" the branches could develop the dense, intertwined demarcations.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, some 45 000 kilometres of the hedges stretch and give the picture of a wooded, diverse landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat of around 7000 species.
In one kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be achieved if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he grumbles about a light tree line that, in addition to biodiversity, also reduces the impact of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knickpflege may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about location on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and the tsunami:
Were you on the spot during the tsunamis?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive for more than 20 hours, as the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What's the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also accommodated other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run on surrounding hills, where they still have no access to water and food because of fear of another tsunami and earthquake.
Some stop in front of their homes, there are still aftershocks.
Because many food shops and also the gas stations are completely closed, people steal food and gasoline in part.
The public service has been completely shut down and the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners run partly free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How are communication and information services on the island going?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before that it didn't work and we only got information about the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, of whom they do not know whether they live or where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquake, but were on the way, for example, to work.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific fire ring, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injury against Werder: VfB must for a long time refrain from Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will be missing the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo attracted a muscle fiber crack in the back left thigh, the football leaguer announced on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle fracture in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss out even after the next national game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not submit a forecast of the downtime.
A muscle bundle crack usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber crack usually heals a little faster.

Board Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbot tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of hearings planned is very limited.
With an FBI investigation into the turbot tempo, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate are seeking to secure the ultra-thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is disputed for pleas of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for investigators to Friday to investigate the alleged incidents that have occurred more than 30 years ago.
The recent turn in the drama around Kavanaugh's appeal, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist was provoking angry Tirads against the opposition democrats, the Senate's Judicial Committee should clear the way for the final confirmation of the ore-conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still called the serious reservations on Thursday as a "funny", first held further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in misfortune".
In this way, he said, the last doubts could be resolved.
Trump later attacked the Democrats sharply at a poll because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump arranges an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of investigators.
One will specifically investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government representative said to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the town council, the mobile radar unit of the town community Ried, installed in a "civil vehicle", is stationed on the garden road from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season win against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, against Mainz also the factor time played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidelberg is a giant pessimist at football matches.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our punishment room," said Schalke 04 sports director and breathed.
Finally, the royal blues managed to bring the close of 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof and subject.
In fact, it could have come differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11. the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In total, the first half-time was good, both playful and from the pressing"., with increasing playing time, obviously played more and more of the head.
Don't make a headball game.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," said Heidel: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defend against Mainz with man and mouse.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who had no immaterial part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man-made world."
But in the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, quiet and brave, so we have to do games over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest defect of the afternoon: King Blue missed it, rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Evhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victory," said Tedesco, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scarf.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometres away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at about 13.30 a.m. observed a fire.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause soon found out police and fire brigade: An unknown person had lit up garbage on a two square meter surface at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had watched the fire for a long time, but then left the fire unattended.
And that in the vicinity of the forest.
30 Fischbachauer Feuerwehrler were busy pulling apart and deleting.
The police are now investigating for arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfeld Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the alliance of "cultural policy" in the orientation of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very easily, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, hand-fixed numbers and one or another joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
In spite of successful integration, why are there increasing conflicts?
The Syrian-speaking author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table, German society sits, at the cat's table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting at the big table and now want to participate.
That leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether one is politically placed to the right or to the left, but rather: "Am I in favour of or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
In the beginning, behave rather, then the discussion starts more and more.
And there is a need for speech.
From his perspective, an Afghan refugee tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands before, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not push his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing hour, he has also been an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively discussed further.
Basketball: Bonn and Casting Win Start-up Games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and an away win.
Gießen competed in a hard-hit game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonners won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
Much more effort was made at the beginning of the new season of German champions Bayern Munich and former serial master Brose Bamberg.
Munich was already working on a 83:77 on Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg with 84:80.
Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obviously huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the properties in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first plots in the new Landsham-Süd area on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick tells us that.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that the municipality offers at cheaper conditions or prices - similar to the former local model.
A good 100 applications had been received, Frick said.
"Currently, the documents will be examined", with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninge, the aim was to have the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the council.
After that, the award could be made.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created on the site in the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses, each of which is expected to have eight housing units.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and roads will soon be paved.
A single plot and two of the multifamily houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in a socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 homes funded by the Free State, income-oriented.
Space for 200 people
It is estimated that about 200 people will live on the land of the new Landsham-South area.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, the start is being made for the new construction of a daycare centre.
It is to accommodate three kindergarten and three crib groups as well as a multipurpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This way Schalkes Naldo "great sport" succeeds also on the bank
For the third time in a row, Naldo does not thank Domenico Tedesco at Schalke-Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had spent the third time in a row not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bench, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre-large Brazilian had once talked about the soul's frustration.
But when after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05, the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle as usual and thanked Chef Trainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all called Naldo for simplicity, turned in and said: "We have to thank you, Trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his second captain, who, despite his reservist existence, had no grudge.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scarf last season, knows that he did not actually get on the set-up track with his coach - but for good reasons he gets a break.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you honestly," said Tedesco of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the startel.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the club," Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that everyone is able to get through at the moment.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which also caught Naldo last time.
And the Brazilians responded to the wisdom of their advanced age: by showing himself on the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry continued its downhill trip in August compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
In Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, and on Monday the Markit Institute announced its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI of the Euro-zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, so the index is still the 13th month in a row under the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
The only Irish industry hit this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level at 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst is over," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in the third quarter at least - remains number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not been as strong as since November 2011.
As a result, the companies closed down jobs for the seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China also declined more than initially accepted in August.
The mood barometer sank from 49,3 points in the previous month to 47,6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Manager Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices are being raised.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds behind victory in the eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice Trainer Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At OGC Nice, the title defender won two hits from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league game.
Olympique Lyon, France, had recently made such a good start in the season 82 years ago.
The Brazilian Neymar led the PSG after 22 minutes and produced the final score in the replay time.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also passed the general test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the king class, Tuchel's team had had to take the only compulsory game defeat in Liverpool at 2:3 this season.
