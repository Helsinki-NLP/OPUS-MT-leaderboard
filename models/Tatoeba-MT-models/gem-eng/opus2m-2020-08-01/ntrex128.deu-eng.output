Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
In the case of some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change its title in the Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This is due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament" (Welsh Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of the mockery.
One member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name is “with Twp” and “Pwp”.
For non-Validian readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: "The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorised the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which provided broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or the WMPs, while at a public hearing the option "MWP" was given the greatest support.
The members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle for consensus could pose a problem for President Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft law within weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include further changes to the operation of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members of the National Assembly and on the organisation of the Committee System.
The members of the National Assembly may, in their debate on the law, vote definitively on their names.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change in the country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The referendum was scheduled to settle a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province of the same name Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken against its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I was talking to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," Adams said.
'There is no more both today.'
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people regularly appear."
At the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume and that they will "be back at the beginning sooner or later".
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held its services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to hire or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Johnson's father planned to rebuild the building, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who rang the bell in July, used other words: 'A cultural treasure' and 'an irreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, 18 years ago who had changed to the bigger bell game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been happening in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been attracted in part by the lay leaders of the Church and in part by the bishop's diocese.
In July, the municipal board of directors, consisting of lay leaders, expressed written concern to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass the costs on to the municipal board, even though it had not been involved in the commission of the diocese-elected architects and contractors.
Some parishioners complain of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds while diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, a shark officially attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for Lobstern.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the channel KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cries for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was pleased to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn apart.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier in the area. However, it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for investigation and security reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's tackles with cosmetics departments that are attractive to department stores, which are occupied with specialist assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
As part of a major advance towards the 2.8 billion UK pound comprehensive cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches are being tested nationwide. If they prove successful, they will be extended to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of the supermarkets for opportunities to use store space previously used for TVs, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's data, the scope of its cosmetic offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its “Boutique” make-up series, so that most of the products are vegan friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test in two Sainsbury's financial sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham in the course of this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small food quantities in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight the discount Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since the purchase of the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos outlets and also a number of Habitat sales outlets. This has increased food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows on from Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branch pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan insofar as an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the seductive environment and the low-cost locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million British pounds
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "hot" after TV moderator Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The two's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop.
The "This Morning" modernist, 37, announced her withdrawal from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connecting contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "enraged" when the "golden girl" of television at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted not to be able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly due to its new business – to the value of up to 1.5 million pounds in Britain.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure its future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising for all parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just before the launch of the market.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investment in products from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market entry.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, was added as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is to become brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV broadcast.
A Jones-related source said last night: "We are not commenting on his business affairs."
Hard words 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he expected of the news media for a comment that some would regard as 'non-presidential' and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that following the voice of a news moderator:
"I have given up nothing."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization in June.
However, the denucleation negotiations have fallen to a standstill.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said to leading politicians from all over the world on Saturday on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding reaction" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the United States observed sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump proved to be much more optimistic in his rally speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of rocket tests, support in the release of hostages and return of the mortal remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for the mobilisation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international support, so this is a bit difficult," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesperson of the Civil Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still poorly prepared for natural violence.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warnings in Palu, despite a warning in force, have probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands are already a challenge in the optimal case.
Logistics is made even more complicated by natural disasters.
A lazaret ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made improving the beaten-up Indonesian infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the next year's re-election campaign is suffering from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes and apartments when bands from Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with macheter, arrow and bow and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1 level of his team about 27 meters away from the gate of Chelsea.
He aimed for the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the right upper corner of the grid.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard with a hit of 1:0 after a 25-minute hit.
The Blues stormer returned a pass with the heel to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good steep pass, so that Hazard got into the penitentiary.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the Stadium San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London at the UEFA Europa League Videoton.
The number of victims of Tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and the tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the Civil Protection Authority announced on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been collapsed by the earthquake of strength 7.5 on Friday, which caused waves up to six metres high, reported the official speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, for murder suspects after a woman has been stabbed
After the discovery of a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was started.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police are asking the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police officer confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe the woman has arrived at the crime scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police reported that they are informing the victim's next relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
It repeats again and again, 'that is so terrible'.
At 14:00 there were two police vehicles within the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Within the lockout were several police officers who monitored the housing block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call the number 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art products, reminiscent of the Taliban, by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as 'torture' and 'try to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's statue before the Palace of Westminster was the goal.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestors Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended Parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely true representation is the subject of ongoing history debates.
It is certain that the conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and reminding them."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers to death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a broken artery in the vicinity of a pig stable on the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, South China reported the Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer will be ready to inject pigs in Xining Province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005.
He was reported to have arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pighouse was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on the snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Photographs of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that pigs had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police were collecting evidence at the crime scene.
According to Yuan's family and market authorities, reports of compensation for his death are being negotiated.
It is rare for pigs to attack people, but such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram pig trapped a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was fed from his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs were not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as a "striker".
“They’re just playful.
They like to twirl and are very curious ... they are not bent on hurting someone.
You just have to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain in the southwest of the USA
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens along the way over the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods of rain in North Mexico and the South West of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock East Coastal Time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is forming over the Pacific Ocean, heading east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will cause precipitation up to 25 centimeters on Monday in parts of Mexico.
Then, in the days to come, the tropical humidity will be caused by interactions with the attracting trough, widespread rainfall in the south-west.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous floods, water-driven debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity causes precipitation rates from almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of floods of rapid worsening conditions.
In the face of the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert.
Strong rainfall can lead to raging currents from Canyons, and thunderstorms bring with them local wind and wind, which leads to dust.
The nearby trough brings local heavy rain in parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation of more than one centimeter may be possible, which can lead to a small amount of debris drifting in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday heavy rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the constant summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October is expected with wide-spread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the East of the USA.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million viewers saw on Thursday at six television networks the captivating statements of Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation continued. On Friday, TV stations interrupted their regular program due to a turn-around at the last minute: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a one-week investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's judicial committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party and had tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company calculated the average audiences at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this into perspective, this is equivalent to the numbers of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, recorded the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama of Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras of CNN and CBS, as protesters loudly urged him on the way to a hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood for minutes with a lowered view while being trained. The scene was broadcast live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"You have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the elevator concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks sent live hours later, when the Judicial Committee was supposed to vote on the transfer of the nomination of Kavanaughs to the Senate as a whole.
Flake, however, said that he would do this only on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demanded to investigate the accusations against the candidate in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Count and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance as it was obvious that without the investigation the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation of the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to leave the European Union of exploiting the future of Britain for political purposes and undermining the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on September 29, 2018, at the Conservative Party's party in Birmingham.
In an interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by calling a proposal that provides for the reciprocal collection of customs duties by the UK and the EU as "completely absurd".
Deadly shots at Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shots at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained for murder, according to Baton Rouge's police.
The authority published video footage of the conflict between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As reported by the CBS partner station WAFB, the police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA glasses had been found.
After a Simpson survey, the police reported that he was facing the fatal shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published on Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for "their care and its pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m large wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply shaken" about Wayde's death and "stricken".
"You're always afraid of something like that," said Wade.
Volcano feeds ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes thrown out of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of caverns and tremors.
Images in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in districts of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Since September 2017, geophysicists have reported an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico, increased activity at the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
On Saturday after clashes between the emergency police and pro-independence protesters, six persons were arrested in Barcelona. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarist independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the emergency police, threw eggs and also scraped paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there was also a handshake with the police who used their batons to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups were scanning 'No Forget, No Forgiveness', while Unionists called 'Long Live Spain'.
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low because the split-off opponents boycotted most of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polls.
Per-independence groups had camped outdoors on Friday over night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulties maintaining the momentum. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in detention, where they are waiting for their proceedings because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been suspended by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in charge since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to challenge the degradation of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house had been beaten by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been hit by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, the car may have been shot with an arm chest.
Menga-Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The raised Livingston FC surprised the rangers and led to second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without any out-of-the-way victory and will face the hearts of the next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, that is, Chief Trainer Holt has no defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for playful guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the match, as his directness posed the rangers with various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was pushed in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came to pass.
The Rangers gave a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance to join Declan Gallagher and Robinson in shooting Menga. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but the defense of the hosts could not overcome, and Gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely uninvited.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced it to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was deflected by Rangers Gatekeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow dragged the ball past from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered the prison area of Livingston and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required offenses – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were denied.
"Phenonal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding and met the expectations of this upward trend again.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on to Trab during the entire game.
The rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As much as they were occasionally among Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Her last ball was inadequate – only once they could get through the host team – and that's something like a wake-up call for the rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) smiling faces and blue sky prevailed when the Heads of Government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to help repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque. However, many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also heard. They condemned Erdogan’s politics as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and maligned by others as a autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in a car crash
When a car hit, a cyclist died in London.
The clash took place at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic-rich street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics took care of the man who died at the accident site.
months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident involving a driver's flight on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to inform his next relatives.
Road barriers and diversions for buses are set up, and the drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Distress
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The unrest broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. in British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still continues.
Special "Tornado" officials have been added to end the unrest involving eight occupants and limited to one wing.
The officials were treated on site for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff were used to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and possibly spend longer time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, emergency officials were called to the prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floods (door areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa cross the south-west marked by deserts and bring with it the risk of floods of floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will approach with rain on Monday evening and leave directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have come close as tropical storms or tropical depression Phoenix to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and can be divided into up to 10 centimeters.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and will be located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Subsequently, the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico, Rosa will meet with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The rainfall in parts of Mexico may be severe, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimeters are expected, with up to 25 centimeters possible," reported weather.com.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move north across Mexico, reach the border with Arizona on early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"As a major threat, very severe rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the south-west of the United States, in connection with pink or its remains," the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods and floods are expected in the desert, as well as in mountainous areas of Erdrutsche.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was injured on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. in British summer time in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
The officials asked all those who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered 'under the commonwealth, the anger' of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the commonwealth, the anger" of the Democrats throughout the process of nomination.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the congress and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement at the hearing on her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the general public," he said to the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not coming, but in reality I'm coming," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats saw their mission in "resistance and blocking".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high-level member of the GOP leadership against CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, numbers of victims are rising
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were swam away when a strong earthquake and a tsunamis hit the beaches on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people came together on Friday at a party on the beach of Palu, when the darkness broke down and hit the beach with waves up to six meters high, and many people were killed and destroyed by what was in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When yesterday the threat from the tsunami came up, the people still went to the beach and did not immediately run away, and they fell victim to him," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency BNP at a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, he swam cars, tree trunks and houses with him, he encountered everything on land," Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
Some people had climbed trees while fleeing the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centres in Palu.
Airviews published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday the coastal town was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that, during the massive earthquake of Friday, energy released had matched the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Because of the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have increased, said the authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to his data, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed by Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement of the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse', said the statement.
On Saturday, the authority was frequently criticized for not having informed that a tsunami Palu had met, although the waves occurred according to official information at the time of the warning.
In social media published amateur photographs show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns the people on the street below him against the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall forces onto the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo in evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of Tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in the inner courtyard of their office, but, according to Dozebas, they passed scenes of destruction along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began to work hard to get disaster relief started, some noted that skilled foreign helpers would be hindered on the trip to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and staff from abroad are only possible if the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened so far.
"At the moment it is still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell on Palu from Friday, friends and family members hoped for one of the wonders that lit up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewer canal.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subando, the trainer of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
Other of the prisoners in the Roa-Roa-Hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp news had sent to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, led to only grey question marks instead of blue ticks.
"I think that means that the news has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 US dollars while filling a ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, Newport’s staff stole 26750 US dollars from a Brink’s employee in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to deposit more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money that was destined for the machine.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: 'The being formally known as Kanye West'.
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
It acts as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has resigned for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not just an abbreviation of his current professional name, but, according to his own statement, it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only became ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledged not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired a peaceful demonstration on the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were in the process of establishing themselves in all of Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of training opportunities led to criminal gangs among young people.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, US spending on research in this field should double, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on from AI announcements of various areas of the US government, even if the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all the other countries are so much further behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough," said Lee.
The doubling of the financial resources could double the chances that the next great AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player. Later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised previous technology competitions of the US government such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China is taking away the top academics, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting Koryphäen from universities to work at AI.
According to Lee's opinion, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to the US's AI efforts.
"I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the field of AI-promoted people," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee's words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people from academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where partners from industry and science should be involved. In addition, the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of USD 2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than USD 100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has happened in US laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change in the country name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to 'North Macedonia Republic', which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is raised to the Greek territory. Greece has therefore imposed a veto against Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name. However, nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign doubts that the vote will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the vote was: 'Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the change of name, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of inclusion in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the outcome so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, with 66 percent of registered voters voting.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their voice in the referendum on the change of the country name which Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and to the European Union.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
In his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian channel Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy per cent of them said they would vote 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the politics of the pro-Western government since its takeover of power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to reach the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at Manchester City's 2:0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hits look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders at the edge of Brighton's penalty.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have achieved a goal at this moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker aimed for the ball into the net shortly before he slipped out.
City plays in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim versus Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force further deployment.
However, the ever-performing joker hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday on the hill, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game lead in the NL West in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for which playoffs are relevant.
The Rockies achieved at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere of the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why should I not want to take part in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are inclined to have jokes thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced on Thursday in Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal day of rest.
This season, the Washington Lawyer has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the Kavanaugh board chosen by him for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the intermediate elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
That's one of the big, big ones – I don't get on, but I'm actually getting on, that's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the commonness, the abomination.
It doesn't matter to them who they hurt, who they have to overrun, to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The democrats, he said, saw their mission in 'resisting and blocking'.
'And you see that in the last four days', he said, calling the Democrats 'hot and mean and horrible and dishonest'.
He named the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate's Committee of Justice, Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused bulwarks in the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer allows all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who express their views.
When the Momentum activists in my local party agreed to blame me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, as she had vigorously opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for expressing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, Jeremy did not agree with previous top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that 'all meetings should be involved and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MEP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most of the meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'kinderer, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion will then be judged as to whether it is accepted by the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader. Colleagues, with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to turn around and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed – whether in terms of national security or in terms of the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a shimmering ceremony follows in the social media that calls for my election, denounces the political center and says that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues, who daily face a flood of sexual or racist insults and yet never give in to little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that blasphemy has become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn last week demanded that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to be expressed, and with every motion of censure and any change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more rigid.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to pull my head in and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problems.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I was a student 32 years ago, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the whole school literally broke up, joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who most need them – as the municipal council as well as cabinet ministers.
I have never made a heel out of my political views, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be confused about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of Friday's motion: given that the country will rest on a Brexit, harm the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I address this message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many elections or political thoughts will not stop me from acting in my opinion the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeated at the top of the table.
At the end of the day, the success of the home team was due to its superior defense as well as to its better use of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been put to the test in our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have taken better advantage of their chances than we have."
Grant Anderson’s attempt in the 14th minute, raised by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to make the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot took a non-boossed attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty run before reaching a hit directly in the half-time and then made an increased attempt alone, so that it stood for the break 17:5 for Ayr.
However, Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then, a prolonged interruption occurred due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was increased by Climo.
Then, as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again at the end of a phase Melrose had enormous pressure paid the additional man through an unboosted attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained a touchdown from the criminal street behind the advancing Ayr package.
Like almost since the break-up, Climo increased after Kyle Rowe captured David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new careers in gastronomy
"Still Game" Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the restaurant after it turned out that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose screenplay he writes and in which he plays one of the leading roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kruna seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Klår was interested in entering Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": the Bolivian community hopes that a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol before the Navy headquarters in La Paz decorated with rope.
On public buildings a sea blue flag blows.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty."
The memory of the 19th-century loss of resources to Chile in a bloody conflict in Bolivia is as vivid as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment by the International Court of Justice to be taken on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will be following the IGH's judgment on large-scale screens, hoping that the Court will decide in The Hague in favour of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year is facing a controversial struggle for his re-election, there is also much at stake in the sentence on Monday.
"We are about to return to the Pacific," he praised at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, is not entitled to refer to Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of any discussion.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the case was "not complicated".
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
"The current Bolivian government has taken over the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' war rhetoric stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of dispute for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the US
North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made in Singapore during a summit between the chiefs of state of the rivals.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about three months after the summit with the North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore shortly before the start of the fast-track nuclear diplomacy.
Ri expressed the idea that further sanctions and resistance from the US against a declaration to end the Korean war would ever force the north into the knees as "brain splint".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to vote in favour of the declaration without Pjönjang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism that Pjöngang is serious about the absence of an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngång next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to extend your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you will no longer have to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headgear for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world during the Paris fashion week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the running ladder.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge, which just crushed the heads of the models.
As other oversized accessories, watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple were shown with jewels. However, these are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were decorated with stitched lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkelling and scuba goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you are lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hats follow directly on "La Bomba", the straw hat with a margin 60 centimeters wide, all bearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as large as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The sauna bag in reddish orange with bastfransen and a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I think that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has so much excitement that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored."
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland's independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence. This continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sports, art, music and other joint ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the highest possible level of care for their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as a world citizen.
As an educational sector, which can shape and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as elective subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
The current audit results of this year show that languages with the highest existing rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who learned foreign languages obtained grade A at the higher examinations.
From the data collected from 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved grade A at the higher examinations, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages are today seen as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers mentioned for the problems of the occupation of vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more open jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such lifelong ability in the future.
Direct communication with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start before competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which will be considered by 2020 as the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, an independent school will always be able to choose a number of languages with appropriate specialised teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may be.
At this stage in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capability'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
I'll have a beer faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent School.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James take off for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the preseason.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48" Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably play for a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked for his plans for the six-game preseason schedule of the Lakers.
"I don't need preseason games to prepare me at this stage of my career," he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trump's five planned gatherings for the next week, including in his well-intentioned places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vigilance at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming half-time elections in November, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump's rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's rally in West Virginia below as live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Kavanaugh board nominated for the Supreme Court about accusations of sexual misconduct that have been conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains suspended for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
The main objective of this series of events, however, is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in a November.
President Trump's campaign team against Reuters therefore stated that these five rallyes will serve next week to "mobilise volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"The control of Congress is so important to his plans that the President will travel as many states as possible while the campaign season draws near," said a Trump campaigner who did not want to call his name Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report media from Pittsburgh".
The Saturday visit is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is currently in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the USA is showing willingness to fight to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four-parts on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
"They were in the lead with six points, and now there are four, so I think this means a small moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the venue.
Of course, Europe is in favour and there are four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
According to Spieth, however, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the drop to the green and goes ahead with a good example.
The guttural exhilaration screams became louder in the course of his round when he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both himself after he and Thomas had left two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match for them on the 15th hole, triggered a similar scream, which suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
"I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each player.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and have no doubt written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who had not beaten a bowey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly between them and the sheer amount of flowing energy underpin the fact that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who seal a possible European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-person hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swede to a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the bracket.
The four- and four-comparations are so fascinating to look at the way a strategy can change quickly, because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day. However, this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready for battle, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the fours and fours from Saturday to the USA with 10:6 and is going with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the hard-hitting Tiger Woods and thus managed to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the four in the morning against the flawed American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parts, the US resisted more and won two matches, but was unable to pick up the residue.
Jim Furyk's team required eight points in the twelve on Sundays to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend 'Molliwood', won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonised excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally had his brilliance flashed, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played four games as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won two and one against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris not everything went according to their ideas.
The triple major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3, after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had gone into the individual with a residue of four points. However, as a title holder for Furyk’s team, an indecisive one is enough to keep the trophy.
After only two days of standing in second place, it does not look as if they could start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their distrust of the United States and under these circumstances the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that last year North Korea had taken significant action on the basis of “good will”. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and committed itself not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
"We do not see any response from the United States," he said.
'Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be disarming ourselves unilaterally first.'
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed to be repeated in so far as it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the outset, as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US President and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore. In this, Kim was assured to work on the "democracy of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pjönjang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes demands for a relaxation of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'first denuclearisation' and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a ploy of the people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not address plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were the other party to the denuclearization issue instead of the United States, it would not have come to this standstill in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris Speech was very different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim had called "the rocketman" on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the "full destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim to the United Nations for his courage to take disarmament steps. He said, however, that there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions had to remain in force until the denuclearisation of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjongyang for the steps taken.
US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo, however, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of sanctions by the Security Council must in any case continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, definitive and verified denucleation."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to financially wipe out Pjöngång's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pjöngang, he said that progress had been made only to be accused of North Korea hours later, that he had made 'walking-like demands'.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, dismantling a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took 'the appropriate measures'.
He said that Kim had told him that the " corresponding measures" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year in primary education. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture, keeping themselves awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
After their words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course for the first time this year explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University's Health Services, said that the University had decided to introduce the course after she found that students were under heavy sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books. They get information about the effect of caffeine and light as well as the effects of lack of sleep on the sporting performance and the importance of a sleeping routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university site, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," said Professor Czeisler.
The pride of "moving a night shift" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep shortage a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep should be the "secret weapon" of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, weight gain could be avoided, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. Last year he finished one of his courses in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to press on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to undertake a similar study programme before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can remove the circadian rhythm.
Livingston vs. Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game, when Dolly Menga's hits for Steven Gerrard's inconsistency meant a 0:1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first exit victory since the 4:1 Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leading hearts in Ladbroke's premiere.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-term, and the poor rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers also threaten further trouble after Liner Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaken Ayr and reached the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who dropped the Hearts in the last week, and should be enthusiastic about how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure on step and step.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have reached a goal after only two minutes when Menga's first offer led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot next door.
Then a long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed rather hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that after a quarter of an hour he should have been punished by a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson did not allow the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers made only two goals in the first half of the year, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in the 34th minute may not have matched the game, it is not to be denied that they had earned him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his peace and chose Menga for a simple graduation.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibally against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly raced off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they are playing, with Lithgow and Halkett having a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stood up well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty strike late after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The inventor of the violin counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the violin counter.
Since then, the violinist has become a standard element of pop culture, for example, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “This is a violin counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: ‘Actually, I hear a crack!’
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears its name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see degenerate cells"
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" degenerate cells and destroy them.
The vaccine helps the immune system detect degenerate cells in the course of treatment.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancerous types of common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerative cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient who is modified in the laboratory so that they can "see" the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Subsequently, the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West released a Pro-Trump-Tirade after his appearance at SNL and carried a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was built at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he praised Donald Trump and said he wanted to be a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", while wearing a make-america-great-again cape, he continued with a chimper canonade against the Democrats and emphasized his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Board Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock to social media.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had had difficulties behind the stage because of his headband.
“They harassed me behind the stage.
You said, "Don't go out with the cap."
You harassed me!
And then they say I'm in a submerged area," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the sunken area?" He said he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered at least two calls from the audience, and SNL employees were embarrassingly touched, Variety reported. One person said the magazine: "It has become dead silent in the studio."
West had been committed late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West many confused with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU, THAT YOU HAVE BENEFITED THE MASS."
Talkshow moderator Karen Hunter, however, twittered that West is simply himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I DON’T want to reward anyone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology harmful to my community and gives of himself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same is true of us.", she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West" (officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper Snoop Dogg bore the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Know As Prince".
Indictment of attempted murders in connection with assault in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred according to police reports in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is to appear on Monday in front of the referee in Belfast.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor.
"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the macho hero’s stereotype. He said that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also involved in "Game of Thrones", admitted that he was "very important" to solve the problem.
"I personally find the question very important at present, what has gone wrong with the masculinity," he said.
"What have we taught grown-up men about the problem we are now observing?"
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters TV may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculineity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
For with the young men something has clearly gone wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in Prequels or Sequels of "Game of Thrones" next summer.
From November on, Harington is shown in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that the best thing for him was "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, so I got my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the many Emmys award-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
In June 2018, they married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex.
Up to now, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, reported by Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Based on the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate protection in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees had the data of the GOP Senators leaked, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, member of the US House of Representatives, argued on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the members' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles democrat believed that the claims of "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites would be spread.
"Lies, lies and even more horrible lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information should include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct brought against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the contributions was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, reported The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations – was not in any way responsible for the security of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered criticism online, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This dementi is angry," said Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a congressman.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They shall not question the motives of the defendant.
You must be calm and quiet."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having acted too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who takes part in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Criticism about "Johnny English – One lives only three times" – weak spying parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every British-colored new film. This also seems to be true for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy who wrote it” and was stuttering again in 2011 with “Johnny English – Only right now”.
Will an ironic self-paradise on the subject, as obviously we are, become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glamorous, Grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comical creation for cinema visitors in non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is once again the well-behaved secret agent, who detests himself bizarrely cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed a single note to the title melody of "The Time of the Winner" at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos behind travelers and international secret agents who played atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is emerging, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedian elements.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than on adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy misbehavior is not as ingenious and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the misdemeanor of the serving agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already standing before the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-teresa-may character, but the script doesn't give much of what she can work with.
Their secret service advisors inform them that all active spies have been detached and therefore they need to get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolpatschige Johnny English himself, who is now working as a teacher at a chic institution, but has unofficial teaching in the work as an undercover agent. There are a few Gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a annoying woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terribly wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action again. They encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerous in the face of a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve UK computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque paces: Dressed as a waitress, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they provide chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as they are, the subject is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can't the British film industry Rowan Atkinson give a role that really suits his talent?"
Labour disputes to work on a plan according to which the British work four days a week, but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
According to the party, it is reported that company managers pass on to employees the savings made by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off.
This would have been a three-day weekend, but would still have been paid the same way.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country to the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
'A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and with the Party's general industrial policy strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the overall approach is not supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesperson from the Labour Party said: 'A four-day week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a Labour government could carry out "deductions" because of alleged misbehaviour.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to the employees to fund the annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy commented in the news magazine “60 Minutes” whether the investigation by the FBI in the case of Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican Senators Authority could influence to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could show anything that might ultimately change her mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I announced in the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been thwarted in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has disputed this vehemently," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called her couldn't confirm it."
It's now 36 years old.
And I can't make any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty during this festival?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, with an annual music festival with an impressive line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group tries to fight poverty by encouraging more and more people to take an active part in poverty reduction.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to do a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteering, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizens will remain for 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to put a cool free concert in view, a reasonable way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens announced that since 2011, the project has been able to track down more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions should have helped to encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, Group 390 quoted commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been paid out or contracted by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in fighting malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
In answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But similar to the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who perform at this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also presenters.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to impede Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examination, Washington can use the Navy if necessary to prevent energy from Russia from reaching the markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary Ryan Zinke announced.
Zinc claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently active at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc turned to the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that understands itself as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the USA.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, calling Russia "One Trick Pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations were made when the government under Trump was extending the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, has become the "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion US dollars, is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received a counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Association for Industry (BDI), has invited the US to stand out from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," says the board of directors of the BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine" a presidential candidate for 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine" a presidential candidate after the mid-elections.
During a Town Hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine" a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
In her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, Warren did not take a leaf in front of her mouth.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that an FBI investigation is of course necessary before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the poll of the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent in favour of a potential candidate, and 48 percent in favour.
Among the other names of prominent democrats who are eligible for a candidate for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin says on the Donald Trump-Ralley about post-traumatic stress disorder under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through, when he comes back, can imitate other families who feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in space" and said about her son and other war veterans that she was coming back to change, that she was coming back, that she was coming back and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and D.C. support an appeal for a new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support an appeal against a new US policy that refuses asylum victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and districts submitted a hearing on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace counter-session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She reported that her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but the U.S. official rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are applying for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with great problems of criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum while fleeing domestic violence.
The Federal Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "Ignores the decades of legislation at state, state and international levels".
"The Federal Act requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and that court infringes this principle," was stated in the Court's statement.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy of refusing access to the country has an adverse impact on the economy of the United States, since immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workers.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that immigrants fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer be granted asylum.
"Asyl exists for all those who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because of fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political conviction," said sessions in his announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to alleviate all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems people face every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of victims of death doubled in the race over time
For the survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed city centre of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to collect their food and wealth and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals that were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overburdened.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who took on vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients in the outside area were treated for the continuing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the fallen walls," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was peace.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place."
U.S. ambassadors accuse China of tyranny with 'propaganda ads'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, the US ambassador in China accused the capital city of Beijing of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of interfering in the US Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China contests.
Trump's allegations that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections correspond to the announcement of US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extreme trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were to meet exporters in countries like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who exports largely agricultural products to China, announced that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubled this tyranny by making propaganda ads in its own free press in the USA.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the American tradition of free expression and independent press by switching paid advertising on the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find only a limited number of votes against the newspaper cast here in Beijing and will not find a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about the worrying economic development of China, given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans beat voters against the middle elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the forthcoming interim elections, which could in particular arise from women.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
"You can't undo these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute advance (R-Arizona) would be sufficient for an FBI investigation to soften angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily paper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate's lobby called 'November is coming' when the Republicans who controlled the Judicial Committee decided to stick to the nomination of Kavanaugh and, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public statement that their accusations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could result if the Republicans were to advance the confirmation.
"This situation is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the body, the final vote or the verification of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," Guy Cecil, director of Priority's USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, informed the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree, who they should believe on the basis of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% indicated that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying to his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an oath last week before the Senate Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party in Yale during her studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup to establish a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open-source solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and who receives access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best idea that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
"We need to become active now," he said on the topic of startup.
"It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-dos lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide alone who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding capabilities so that Solid is available to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM is used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not exchange views with Facebook and Google on whether a comprehensive change should be made to completely transform their entire business models overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a major player in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the Web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award because of his commitment to attack Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolism, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy fire by field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before moving forward with a field weapon alone and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something he could never justify, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the bravery of a real hero became visible mainly through the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't watch the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night long in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock then, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom did not marvel at the sudden sight of Peppa Pig.
Some remained untouched after they stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to see the battle in particular.
On Twitter, a fan described the change to the cartoon character as some sort of bad joke.
"On the basis of a government regulation, these contents are not considered as youth-free, so that at 6:00 p.m. they had to be changed to a children's broadcast," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication at Bellator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will work out the schedule to take future UK viewers into account.
"I think the problem might have been solved in the repeat game," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday at the audience in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay with you.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical problem.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce it all to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in the normal case. And we have tried to provide the fans with the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "subsidized" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the secondary school that he is different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne he said that he has spoken on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympic Games are no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for several months.
In the first show of Laverne he said that earlier he regarded himself as inferior compared to others, because love of boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: 'Until today, the feeling of subjugating others and being different from the others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.'
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke on this subject because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games with 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, he would've turned everything around gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the near death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets for London in 2012, because he wanted to be there at the front.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that did I finally realize that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at Olympic games – that was crazy," he said.
His first song selection – Proud von Heather Small – was also influenced by it. He heard the song in front of the Olympic Games and still cared for goosebumps.

Mickelson, currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the spare bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the event as usual, the five-time major champion spent his day in firing others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who joined Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer at these tournaments to win all four games this week.
If the Americans have four points left behind in the 12 single games a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed himself confidently to Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was perfectly aware of his role today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow," said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He is one of the world's well-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went, and that's what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race track that never completely matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had to make 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Fryk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he's a great person who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week. It was fun watching them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can be over soon with the lead.
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage that leads to the final single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997, in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only barely crossed the finish line and led by the lowest possible lead, winning a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was just short,” said Bjørn (pictured in the photo), having seen the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's going to be all right tomorrow.
Get in the stuff and do the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm concentrating on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what's happening to us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance his players have performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overrun it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are in the foreground and this is a completely different matter.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players cut each other out better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that great turnaround on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner's side before standing on the losers' side after Europe's 'Medish Wonder'.
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to take off the quick start you’ve seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum moves in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we try to enchant tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of picking up the counterweight, he has to perform in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking.
"I chose the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media it will be delivered due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs only at the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time called a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen-Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-flying missiles and target missiles as well as core technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can cause the state-of-the-art warships, which are to be Germany's maritime power, to be outdated at the time of their entry into service, according to Die Zeit.
Last year, the F125 frigate chased by the accident entered the headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after it was delivered to the shipyard.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors" which would have made the new ship useless in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg-Class are operated by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen-Class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Marine from carrying out upgrade measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of 'Rheinland-Pfalz' was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the crew training costs, also became a problem.
It seems that costs rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, German Bundestag's military officer, confirmed that the Navy was "going out of employable ships".
Bartels said that the problem got bigger over time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to initiate future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown Langohr and bats in Inverewe Garden in West Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of bat calls is determined and determined which species does what.
Then a map and a habitat report are created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to obtain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to the loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also represent a risk, as can flycatchers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by house cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes because of their nocturnal hunting habits when it comes to catching prey.
They use an sophisticated echo type to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
"Here in Threewe have a great area for bats," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there are many things we do not yet know about bats, so here and on other commodities we are doing these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable."
He stressed the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and juveniles and wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting grounds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish best friend of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still need to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we do not know what their populations are like."
Ronaldo fights rape charges while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called rape accusations against him "Fake News" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The stormer of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375.000 to buy her silence on the incident, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Instagram live video about his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports only hours after their release as "Fake News."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the balloon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smilingly.
Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue the mirror on the basis of the allegations they have made by Reuters as 'irregular reporting on privacy offences'.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player claimed compensation for "moral damage at a level that corresponds to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he raped them anal according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to her knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it had been agreeable.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she had "anguish of retribution" and was concerned about being " publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to cancel the agreement because she is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and changed this summer in a 100 million Euro deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “never regret” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if, after Brexit, it lost its status as a world leading manufacturer of cars, according to Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark.
He continued to say that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the plant in Burnaston at Derby, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delays at the border in a no-deal brexit could lead to job losses.
Last year the plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines Auris and Avensis were produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops at our plant at an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are associated with risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to produce the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that would last longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
"We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, which, as I said, allows us not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he explained in the BBC Radio 4 show today.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience of these jobs never comes back once they are gone.
One government speaker said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU'.
Trump's scheduled meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be 'moved for another week' while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said it from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has overseen the work of the Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian elections, connections between Trump's consultants and Russia and a possible judicial barrier by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump and the President's resignation with the help of the 25th Constitutional Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday while new reports on his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump stated that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the US Senate's Judicial Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, stated.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, thereby delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press spokesperson Sarah Sanders was released on Sunday on Fox News.
She replied to a question about meeting with Rosenstein: "A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters might object to this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not tend to disapprove of the TV reporters' 'effect hashism', but admitted: 'I would not deny that they are engaged in power hashing'.
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President has made more questions and answers than any President before him," she said, without providing precise evidence: 'We have looked at these figures.'
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but it is “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but much better than to speak to me.
We often try to do this and you have seen that we have done this a lot in recent weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he performed a bizarre appearance before assembled reporters.
Minister for Health writes because of Brexit concerns about EU workers in the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressing people from EU abroad working in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the cost of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised Scottish public service.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK Government has also reinforced the preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, thus benefiting patients and communities to whom we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery following a head injury
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, the linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, reported that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff supplied abercrombie on the sideline with oxygen before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A spokesperson from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State tries to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season with Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, increasing his total in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future.
This step is to curb Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in stamping fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, with the additional income to benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable living space and take top earners into the sights.
The increase in the stamp tax is levied on individuals and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenue is to be allocated to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second-hand apartments and residential properties left for rent, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance calculates by the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not based in the UK. This will drive prices up and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy will follow only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has voted to reduce the stamp tax in order to allow more young people to have the first home.
He accused construction companies of raising real estate prices by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's 'living room scandal'.
The opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a price fixing to the ban on rooms without any good reason.
He also wants to grant city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which the life of generation after generation would be better.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too great a problem."
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says that it is his “greatest goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old shooter enjoys the challenge of rejuvenating the club from the north-east of England, which is in third place in the League One and is missing the top three points.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that was it," said Ross of the BBC Scotland Sports Sound show.
“But as a child, I have often seen Scotland playing in Hampden with my father, and that is something that always drags me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to step into the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can return the club to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities in this association, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would only consider my time here as a success if I brought the club back there."
Ross can have a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month position as trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the religion to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real route of divorce," he remembers when he took responsibility for Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than games.
It sounds funny, because I didn't feel bad about it, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., so a study
The heat wave in summer has missed a surge in the revenue of Britain's crisis-making pubs, while restaurant chains have been under greater pressure.
In July, sales growth of 2.7 percent was recorded by pubs and bar companies. According to statistics, however, revenue at restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Increasing sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which Pub’s sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant met even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with a surface-adjusted sales trend that rose higher than at the restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages rose by 6.6 per cent in the month, while sales of food decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM leisure and restaurant industry, said: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the most important factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to persistent cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for companies with a focus on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures will provide the much needed breath in August."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts with social media that it hides from its parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of the students reported owning a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a link to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message sparks fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean "main account" that they can show their parents, but also to own private accounts.
A mother who ran into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to "rape me."
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half admitting to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the voice of athletes in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Association Council at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the Scottish, UK and world Athletics Association and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from their choice in the Council," says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, named a total of four Olympic gold medals and now often appeared as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can say whether or not I'm going to be cured.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows provides excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps excited the network with an advertising clip comparing breast-feeding mothers to the milking of cows.
In order to introduce into the market the 'first low-noise portable milk pump worldwide', the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a much less serious music video in order to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text such as: "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a cock at me" or "if you haven't noticed, these are not udders but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among the audiences, many of whom say that it is harmless to the "fears" of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
Just as we do, they must become pregnant and bear a calf in order to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Exceptly traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: 'This is a different form of advertising.'
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: "This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like "cow".
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like dairy cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a daring and provocative market launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the associated challenges at the heart and at the same time introduce in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that allows the new pump.
This isn't the first time that Elvie's pump got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared as a double mother on the Catwalk, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrants were quietly brought to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of immigrant children who have been interned is as high as never before, although the number of border crossings has remained relatively similar, among other things, as intensified rhetoric and measures by the Trump government have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target of expulsion themselves when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential carers and other adult members of their households would have to give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the Customs Department Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before the Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the support of unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Nearly 80 per cent of people who are either self-employed or a member of a household of a caregiver are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are compulsorily foreigners.
That is why we will continue to follow these people," said Albence.
In order to be able to deal more quickly with children’s cases, officials introduced new rules, which according to the staff of the accommodation of some children, required to appear within a month instead of 60 days after the detention in court, which was the standard.
Many will appear by video and not personally in order to stand in front of an immigration judge for their legal status.
If negative decisions are taken, the person is quickly expelled.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have become known in the last month from the system that they are being anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced by a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems that are easier to overlook due to the size.
They also explained that traumas that many of the children already suffer could be intensified if they were taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘crew troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil and were "treated accordingly" with the pretext of fighting terrorism.
"You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he explained to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror was almost over" in Syria, where since 2011 more than 360,000 people have died and millions more people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all the Syrian territories are cleaned up" both by terrorist groups and 'any illegal foreign presence'.
The United States has stationed about 2000 soldiers in Syria who mainly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused 'some Western countries' of spreading 'irrational fears' which prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make return home possible," he said.
"They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no aid for Syria would be granted until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats of the UN stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major Rebellenhochburg Idlib represents the opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, allied to Al-Qaeda, will be 'deleted'.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee soon, consisting of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem called the conditions of the Syrian government for participation in the committee and stated that its work should be limited to the "recast of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, a withdrawal or a scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time'.
So far, there's no evidence that the audience would be tired.
Since 2014, the switch-on rates at the best transmission time at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the turn-on rates with 3.5 million viewers on nights with important news.
"This is like a fire that magically attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, show runner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" broadcast on the TV station ABC about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd pick Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘because he makes me laugh’” Scovell told me.
The chaos has value in entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything on television, can determine the future of the basic decision on abortions by Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it is also possible to be an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having already six hours of an expert round that discusses about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "deep background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15.000 dollar expensive bomber jacket made of ostrich leather (according to Washington Post a "piece rich in self-esteem") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's ripple description of Trump's, um, anatomy.
For my part, Super Mario will never be able to see again with the same eyes.
"A part of what he's doing can feel like a reality show he's planning every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series "The Three of the Pfandhaus", about Trump's rotating occupation and daily activities (break a fight with the football league NFL from the fence, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode, or you won't come along anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he grew up inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He just couldn't get out of the screen, not if judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows back then and the people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” told me Fleiss.
"I thought that was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Donations flow the narrowest races around seats in Congress at the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is flooded with donations thanks to the new borders of the electoral district, which led to two members in the race standing around the same seat.
The recently redrawn suburb district in Pittsburg allows the Democratic Conor Lamb to enter, who won his seat in another district during a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were violated the Constitution and manipulated to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of electoral funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a well-considered special election in March around the 18th district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won the lead there with 20 percentage points.
Polit experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The US examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the management team of the Trump Organization.
According to Heather Nauert, Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a statement at the beginning of the month, officials from the US Department of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of 'the recent decisions to cease to recognise Taiwan'.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was consideration given to penalties, which in 2017 were estimated to receive USD 140 million in US aid, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar meeting in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference in mid-October, in order to provide, according to diplomats, a sign of the importance that the government of the Assembly has given.
The three American diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new outrageous announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesperson from John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to comment on the internal discussions.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump's possible legal disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public domain.
Mueller now allegedly also investigates whether Trump's election team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump sees himself confronted with an organ that forces him to answer, exactly when he rides past it, to face the voters again; and possibly before a jury of juries.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that Donald Trump’s case, or that of his European counterpart, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the battle will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to conduct a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several such turning points.
What if Trump releases Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated on whether he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein dementes the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is confirmed in the office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle elections for a congress that is forcing Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we'll have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to inflame Sabbath candles on the table with the cross hook.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimisticly before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive reunion against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Because of a knee injury Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for bigger ones.
"This was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We have gone into the game with the conviction that we can do something about it and we have driven home with a point.
Perhaps we could have won in the end, but overall, a decision was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we'll get three points, but that's going to be a tough game, because they've achieved a good result in the last game. But I'm sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of old age leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Dispose of legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a custody authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that your health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be able to express them yourself.
Consider also a proxy for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air gun when he went home from work with friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots that took place around 02:30 a.m. in the UK, as a "willful act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities. The number of dead is likely to increase.
Due to the failed communication systems, auxiliary forces were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Donggala is a district of government that extends over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, there were an estimated 2,99,200 people living in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the Central Sulawesi economy, in particular for the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Civil Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami where nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatras triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the Sumatras coast.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of 7,6 magnitude struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with the strength 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapse in buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular among tourists, and especially claimed over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested for accusations of body injury.
The 29-year-old palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on the grounds of suspicion of domestic violence, the obstruction of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, a report published by Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a friend's phone when she wanted to get in touch with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 was raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plea with 'not guilty, quite sure', the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A irregularities, which can be handed down with up to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to USD 250,000.
He is also burdened with an orderly violation of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the veteran’s court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under anesthetic agents in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend tried to beat her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by Veteran organizations after she traced the behaviour of her son to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Prosecution Requests Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New Yorker Terrorist Attack
The Federal Prosecution in New York demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has been no longer imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of having used a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, as he took a bicycle ride along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, transferring pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight victims killed and "consciously" added serious injuries to the body, according to the statement of intent for the request for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Prosecution Court, Saipov, filed a 22-point charge involving eight charges of the murder in the context of the organised crime, usually used by state attorneys in cases of organised crime, as well as an accusation of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires 'basic planning and intention', according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as 'disgusting, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio damage, pain and loss," the explanation explains.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time in New York was the death penalty in a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who two years earlier were accused of conspiracies in order to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
According to the police, he also demanded to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, stated that she was "of course disappointed" by the decision of the public prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong the trauma suffered by all parties in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal," said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the charges not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party member requests that NIGEL FARAGE be transferred to Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest action within the framework of the Tories Conference.
The former party leader of Ukip said that politicians must "feel the pressure" of the Euroskeptics, while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backboner Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “ready to go outside” if Farage Brexit ministers.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply disputed parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of your party, who are for a stay in the EU, participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping his Chequer compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Euroskeptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that "Chequers belong to the garbage".
He proposed that Farage be named a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was responsible for it, we'd be out there already,' he explained.
The member of Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that since the 2016 referendum, public opinion had changed: ‘The idea that the British people had changed their mind and wanted to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkys was also at the demonstration and stated to reporters: ‘I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a pointed message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Minister will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians need to ‘feel pressure’, that they should be in a position to cheat the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” says Farage.
“They are trying to deceive Brexit and that is why we are here today to tell them, ‘So you can’t get away with it’.
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is just ahead of betraying Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of this country’s people, who will help us to win the referendum and never come to rest, as long as we are not an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched on weekends.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
‘This is a farce.
There’s just not the good Brexit’, he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections she would "examine the presidential candidate".
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outstanding critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race to re-elect the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Massachusetts Geoff Diehl Parliament, who was Vice-Chairman of Trump's campaign team in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women "to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the forefront."
Arrested after death shots on LSU players Sims
Baton Rouge's police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of fatal shots at LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that they had arrested the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and died as a result of this injury," according to the sports media portal 247sports by police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday explained to the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been at the crime scene and possession of a weapon and shot at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-large Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting positions in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the stable order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he were leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton rush into traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box one round later and landed behind Vettel, but overtook Hamilton after a tight wheel-on-wheel manoeuvre, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, with the risk of holding on to two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen began on one of the back squares of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for most of the race, as he held on to his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the box on the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri brought an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to leave me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of himself on Saturday at an election campaign event about Senator Diane Feinstein, who insisted that the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, should not have been passed on to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement before the Senate's Committee of Justice did not address itself directly, but commented that the Senate's proceedings show that people are "common, evil and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the rage when you see people who are angry and mean and evil and dishonest," said the President.
“When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Thinking of your answer... Published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the Senator's voice.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was released at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein argues that the Leak came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, I haven't published your story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy."
Your dementi did not seem good to the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the community, the evil, they don't care who they hurt when they drop under the wheels to gain power and control," said the president, according to the mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the backward play in Dundee again on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two gates leading, after matches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team the balance before Dwyer re-established the management of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two goals.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe who struck Dundee on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening gate took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaul. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the template when Beauvillier expanded the tour.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into play after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to his counter-gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the leadership of the Giants before the mid-term break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard regrouped with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen bring Dundee into the game for the first time late in the second half. Nielsen then won his team with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controllers died after he was certain that hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to have an aircraft with hundreds of people on board safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that the flight 6321 was safely removed from Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was coming in.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, stated that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The country’s Civil Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is expected to increase, as many bodies are still among the debris, while others cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves with a height of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with the dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it could get even worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to do all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" says CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a communication that they cannot say anything about a passenger's whereabouts until Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced to work with the local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying beyond the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others could wade through hip deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working near the improvement of a mooring site were rushing with an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data of the Aviation Safety Network can be seen that 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the charges closed their evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man is accused of having exiled a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said he was an expert in the field of information evaluation for hours.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he reported to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the stand on Saturday and said that he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he turned out to be in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported knowing Chambers at her time of death for two weeks.
But cell phone records pointed out that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chamber's death, Tellis got rid of their news, calls and contact information from his cell phone.
"He snuffed them out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to start their pleayers on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the trial will then be before the jury on that day.

Another black one?!
New Yorker nanny sues couple for a release after "racist" SMS
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother in which she complained that she was still a black person.
The couple disputed to be racist and compared the dispute with a 'expression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
"NEWEEEEEEEEEEEEEN, ANOTHER BLACK," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending them to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her Fauxpas, Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released the "painfully touched" and claimed that the open African-American day-mother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippine woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the 350 dollars a day, which she should have spent over six months on the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she said the newspaper on Friday, "I know that is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism accusations, and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice after they had offended them to no longer be able to trust.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," explained Joel Plasco to the post office.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was out of touch?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the dispute with a 'expression' and stated that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was 'in a difficult situation'.
“You want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple were quickly convicted in public and challenged by the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and their logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our knowledge of Paddington's enormous success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with it, had been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of his death in last year was "bitter sweet".
She explained that her father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she described as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and did not boast," Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that gave her the doctors to keep her heart on pumping sounded slowly and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not scream or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, accompanied by the other passengers who did not get any of what she was going through on board the plane.
"No one knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost family members through a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was only 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was facing a promising career as a cook and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smiles could brighten a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: "I always fear that this could have an impact."
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed," she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was at the low point. When the children unpacked their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that it had to come through: “It tears a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Swelling While the FBI Begins Investigations
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that that he asked for, i.e. a temporary and limited investigation, we could perhaps get a little concord," said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want FBI investigations?
Your reluctance can be traced back to timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to vote on equality of vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflows “sink” under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that last year 1127 overflowers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pjongang did not make a public statement.
Finally, the vast majority of the overruns from the north are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the invaders as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pjöngang for talks that focused on the set-up of denuclearisation negotiations.
This was the result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work on a denucleated Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi House called the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said he was indisposed to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not resist the impression that a woman who had acted this way had been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he almost cried and stood in tears shortly before when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a “grotesque and co-ordinated crime”, organized by Liberals, who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court as she showed that he was biased towards democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way in which he went over the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself has declared himself unsuitable," she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to defecate Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judges' posts," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi continued to say that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion decision by Roe v. Wade, since he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh left out questions as to whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, preconceived person going to this court and expecting us to say, 'Ah, that's not wonderful'," Pelosi says.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It's a sincere hate speech, months and years of overwhelming anger and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also weeps when she gets angry but developed a technique. If she gets angry and starts to cry, she says to the person to whom she said: “You may think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I found this brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a man-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was pulled into a stairwell by an elderly woman, a cold manager, who was always a little afraid.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
“You don’t know you’re smelly.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with them, as they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidate himself.
"That was not a well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarves’.
As the electoral campaign had already progressed, it was at the back of the fund and she vowed not to run if she could not get 2 million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who donated 1000 dollars to men supported their campaign only with 250 dollars.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made the acquisition of funds and the direct addressing of voters instead of the delegates so difficult, as well as the anger over sexism, that she was close to tears.
"One could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls.
“It could have been thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"She cried"?
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening ointments of the trade war between the USA and China were deafening. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a long-term trench between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when he invested with criminal tariffs important Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new criminal tariffs on goods worth 200 billion dollars, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing struck in the same way each time, and recently imposed fines of five to ten percent on American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China vows to respond to any action by the US and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon collapse.
Moving Washington to slow down would mean yielding. However, a public impact on the US would be far too defamatory for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientific assistant who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem explained that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to reverse normality.
All conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993 in Europe.
Europe won back the crown after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with much of the tournament, sank his fall on the 16th line (par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to get the trophy back.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won the singles against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
I'm so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, who I've been following since my childhood on TV," says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The team USA had all weekend problems finding the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Take your hat off for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
