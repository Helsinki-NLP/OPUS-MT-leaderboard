Biden leads the polls in three key states
When there are only 100 days to vote, Joe Biden, a volunteer Democratic, takes advantage of the advantage of three important swings.
CNN reports today that Biden was transferred to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured by 51% and 46% respectively.
In Arizona, the score is 49%-45% Biden in favour and in Michigan, the winner is Biden, where he leads by 12 points, 52%-40%.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these states around, and actually more so.
Trump, who lives these days with a coronary - virus epidemic that is increasingly being blamed by the country, says that the vast majority of the people in question have reacted badly, or very badly, at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has been adversarial to protests and riots that sprang up at the death of George Floyd.
Trump and his government seem to have reacted badly or wrongly to them.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism of having ordered the FBI to break behind protests in cities where city or government officials are Democrats.
Has it produced tremendous wolfishness among the inhabitants of the cities, and that anger is being spread to other Americans?
Also, pictures of federal police plunging Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States cause.
The Lincoln Project's advertising of this very attention, but it can be seen below.
Trump defeated all three states in 2016, but with a very low vote.
In fact, Trump won very many states with a low vote and won the elections with a minority vote.
Michigan, for example, won only 10,704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the population.
Nearly all the polls that political commentators say are significant are showing the same conclusion that Biden is making.
A new survey of CNN in Arizona shows that Biden’s advantage is now out of the scope of the survey.
The same goes for CNN and Quinnipiac University of Florida.
Even Fox News, who leaned well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same research in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the questionnaires, is that Trump could hope to restore important places within the fluctuation zone if the campaign focuses on the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy blow following the Covid-19 epidemic, but voters do not seem to be linked to the economic impact of the coronary virus epidemic.
That is to say, the vast majority of voters seem to blame Trump for having reacted badly to the coronary virus epidemic, but trust him more fully to deal with the economic shock that is taking place in the state at this time.
However, Trump has had a bad time directing the debate in the campaign.
Following the riots that have been almost constantly on fire since the news, the video was horrifying, as four police officers killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion to law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his identifying words.
Now it seems to have failed altogether, as previously said.
As polls more lean on Trump, more and more Republicans are more likely to leave Trump and declare support to either Biden, or someone else, who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically by name.
They do so because of the arrangement in the United States to vote in many elections on the same ballot.
In this way, the vote can simply refer to the second category of the Presidential Election Part of the ballot, and leave it alone as a vote for all other candidates in that category on the ballot.
In this way, the representatives of the Republican Party will try to break free from the slow pace of Trump and achieve independent results in the elections.
The Academy of Youth Games in Dakar Delayed until 2026
The youth’s Olympic Games were to be held in Dakar next year, but they have now been postponed until 2026 because of the coronary virus epidemic after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed.
However, the postponement of the first Olympics to take place in Africa is a shock to many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the Nantes fire
Volunteers in Nantes, France, have been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
According to prosecutor Le Monde, the suspected fugitive from Rwanda, who served as an overseer in the church, admitted to having set the fire on fire.
In conversation with another media, a man’s lawyer tells us that he sees his actions.
Among what was destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century, and the historic pictured windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer who has not been named was arrested shortly after the fire on July 18, but was then released.
He was then given back to report yesterday and was then put in custody.
"No way out of this."
I am well received in the home of Baltasar and Christian Samper, Copavogi.
The reason for my visit is the new exhibition of art by Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, who will be opened on August 1st at the Small Kambi Cave on Snowfell.
Is this the first time the father shows together?
I am led down to the Baltasar’s workshop, where a magnificent painting faces me.
Large and dark pictures of women of old but also of flying creatures; eagle on one, shadow of birds on another.
The workroom is used in the home.
"We had a horse here with us that bit the grass," Baltasar tells me.
“The horse works much better than a butcher on these hills and hills that we have.”
Mireya, with us, is a Christian and a Baltasar, and she tells us how her works interact with the works here.
“Inductions, blend of paperwork and jewelry sculpture.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad is doing, because I'm working with the light and so on," she says.
“ It’s been a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and would have wanted to show there, but they got stuck in Tokyo because of Covid.
When my father started painting and I saw where he was going, I rethinked my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong slogan in Icelandic folklore about women's men and women's bodies.
“ When I saw that my father was doing these paintings with the ladies, I thought it best to make jewelry that relates to them, ” says Mireya, but she works with the Victory of Inga’s Son Bear at Sign.
"So I make an installation out of the jewel."
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy of Sensation, including the Small Kambi barn, and found the building fascinating.
“This is a new space, an old barn that has just been built up,” says Mireya, who talked to a Baldvina Sverrisddódt, an artist who suggested that Mireya and Baltasar set up a show.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938 and attended the University of Art in Barcelona before he went on a world tour to study art collections and research.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961 and was fascinated by a country and a nation.
He returned here a short time later, met his wife, Kristhiana, and has lived here continuously since 1963, for 57 years.
Baltasar, a powerful artist, has held dozens of private shows, and shows of Christ’s people in many parts of the world.
He is best known for his large wall pictures, which include a wall decoration in the Flatey Church and a fresco in the Wide Square Church.
"What affects what I do is the bitterness that Iceland has and no other place," Baltasar says.
“This low sun and these shadows that stretch and stretch.
As soon as I got here, I thought, "Wow, you can work here."
Mireya is the eldest children of Kristöna and Baltasars, born 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was quite clear that I wasn’t going to be a picture artist, ” she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“So I went on a math and physics course in high school and did everything I could to get out of it.
Then I realized that I was fleeing.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laughs.
Like her father, she has shown many things around the world.
Much to make in Japan.
All the children of Baltasar and Kristian have taken the art path.
"I call it a virus," says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this. ”
Count Icelandair has been in grey areas when flight attendants were dismissed
Minister of Social Affairs believes that Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company denounced all flight attendants in the middle of nowhere.
He then claims to have requested that laws involving firefighters enter residential areas be considered after the Brotherhood Step.
On July 17, Icelandair advised to cancel all of the 38 flight attendants who served them at the company while the Führer Society’s main event was still on the table of a government concierge.
The fact that Icelandair was able to respond to these statements was discussed in the section and was prepared for the case to be resolved in the context of a Community judgment.
However, there was never an end to the gathering of flight attendants and Icelandair more than a day after the announcements.
However, Mr Einar Dadason, a social minister, says that in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was made in grey areas and in the right payroll.
“My view is that this is a certain right to defend employees.
When you're in conversation, when you're inside a peacemaker, it's not an option to go this way.
It is absolutely clear to me that this has not been possible.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had entered the grey area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
He won't talk about other companies going the same way as Icelandair.
“You also now see a dangerous discussion that it is only natural to start to jack up this system in order to reduce this right, and therefore I am totally opposed. ”
Also, on the blasting sand this morning, Ásmundur was asked about the government’s reaction to the fire at the end of June, where three people died.
A minister says that the study of the matter is now being conducted on the board of the House and the human body, to which he has referred.
“ It’s in the law today that the fire brigade can’t go into a living room.
I have asked the Institute of Human Resources to examine in particular whether there is any reason to make any legislative changes.
I'm ready to make the changes that need to be made to reduce the chance that this can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.

United States reportedly increases pressure on Nord Stream 2 companies - RT Business News
Further efforts have been made by the United States government to force a European company to abandon the North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, led by Russia, according to the Sunday World, which is witnessing to people who are familiar with the subject.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Department of Energy of the United States have contacted European contractors to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to 12 officials should have held at least two online meetings with representatives of the enterprises in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that the Americans had stressed in a “kind ” tone that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from becoming a reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one dryer to the German media.
These threats are in line with the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement last week when he warned that companies participating in the project would be best placed to "get out now" or to be at risk of punishment under 232 parts of the notorious Countering America's Adverse Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy giant Gazprom, who oversees the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell in addition to Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, a representative of the latter company said that the United States’ efforts to undermine “a major intrusive project ” were a clear intervention in the empire of Europe.
Earlier this week, the U.S. Council of Representatives approved a change to the laws on land defence aimed at extending the US sanctions against companies participating in the installation of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
According to one legal transporter, the resolution can be directed towards companies that pay for, or provide ships, insurance, port status, or connection service to, such ships, as well as those who offer a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and public officials have repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the efforts of the United States to interfere with European energy issues by applying sanctions against Nord Stream 2, and some of them have even called for Brussels to be able to take action.
Moscow’s officials have also harshly criticized the Washington operation and called it unfair competition.
Earlier this week, the president’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told us that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if Washington officials keep the new sanctions under strain.
Prepares further transfers of public institutions to the country
Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs is planning to move more public institutions into the country in the near future.
In the autumn of the fall of the Minister's decision, the Ministry's decision will be moved north by the Department of Housing and Human Resources, but experts in the Department have previously declared that they do not intend to move north.
Mr. Ásmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, said this morning that it was important for the countryside that public institutions were transferred there.
Thus, there is a great value creation that also creates diversity.
“ It’s nationally important, we’re trying to build everything around the country.
Job-building, tax-creating construction, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural uses, and this type of public service work, they are very supportive of that construction," says Ásmundur.
"Produces increased diversity, creates better support for this resource utilisation and the creation of the nation's currency."
The decision taken by Mr Ásmund to move the Humanitarian and Human Resources Fire Department has been strongly criticised by its staff and by the National Association of Fire Departments and Medical Transporters.
Six people who have expertise in fire and work in the department are all living in the capital area, and none of them are going to move their livestock to the sheepfold.
“ I think it’s quite clear that there’s a political difference in how hard this should work.
My view is, and has always been, that we should engage in radical measures to improve the distribution of public services," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighboring nations, the Norwegians and the Danes have been doing this with success.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of public works to land, as I was doing with the National Institute of Housing and Human Resources."
He is an example of the transfer of the Food Agency at Selfoss, Iceland's surveyors to Akraness and Unemployment Insurance on Skaga Beach.
“ Today, there is a place of work on Skaga Beach that is of great importance to that community.
I think we should take further steps in this creature."
“I am preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport."
Fifty arrests in Seattle
Systematic racism and the decision of the President of the United States to send federal police forces to cities to kill riots were widely protested yesterday.
In the fifth century, Protestants were arrested in Seattle.
The Seattle police used bombs and pepper sprays in mass protests yesterday that the police described as riotous.
21 policemen were injured, and at least 45 protesters were arrested.
Two months ago, protests against systematic racism began in the United States after a police officer killed George Floyd.
The blast was at the protests to show protestors in Portland.
There has been a series of violent clashes between police and protestors since the United States president sent a U.S. police force on unmarked cars in unthankful authorities.
Thousands met in Portland on the weekend, using tear gas and rubber bullets by police as they and Protestants struck.
Miracle children 47 years old were owned
The real - life American star Kenya Moore is doing well by strengthening people who need to be assisted by technology.
Moore, who is known for her participation in The Real Housewives of Atlanta, had her first child 47 years of age after she had been born a child of technology and called her daughter a miracle child.
"Almost all my life was waiting to have a baby," said Moore during an interview with People.
"As I knew the anguish people feel, especially women, to think that I might not have a child."
Moore realized that she was running out of time when she was 40 years old.
“I didn’t want to have a baby alone.
I didn't want to be a single mother.
So I waited and after forty, I looked up and thought my god good," said Moore, who, however, did not know her father until she was 46 years old.
One year later, they had a daughter.
The real - life star says her daughter is a miracle child in more than one way.
In addition, as Moore was older than most firstborn, her daughter came into the world one and a half months before the appointed day.
Moore went to a difficult imperial ditch that took much longer than a traditional emperor’s canal.
“ I call her a miracle baby, ” said Moore during the interview, “because this was a child that everyone said was practically no chance for me to have.
Fathers arrested in Mizoram worth 15.4 million rupees of heroin
The value of heroin in the home market was about 15.5 million rupees, and so it was smuggled from Myanmar, according to police
A man and his son were arrested by 1.9 kg of heroin in the Hnahthial region of Mizoram, near the border of Myanmar, was sent to the police on Sunday.

Duhkima (62) and his son Remthangpuia (33) were arrested on Friday night in the village of Ngharchhip, police said.
They also lost about 280 grams [280 grams] of heroin, worth about 1.5 million rupees swimming over on their escape from the police, as reported at the office.
According to police data, this is considered to be one of the largest amounts of heroin that has been seized in the state.
The defendants were sued according to the relevant 1985 laws on drugs and hallucinogenic drugs (NDPS).

A doctor ran 20 miles [35 km] with a mask
The British doctor Tom Lawton ran 35 kilometres in the days with a face mask to show that oxygen saturation did not decrease with the use of facial masks.
Lawton is a doctor at Bradford Royal Hospital and has worked there during the pandemic.
To disprove the theory of oxygen saturation and to encourage people to wear a face mask, Lawton decided to run to work and return with a mask.
Before he started, he set up a collection of GoFundMe for The Trusell Trust, which provides food supplies in Bradford and in many parts of Britain.
“I am a great supporter of everything that keeps us safe.
That's why I've been in shock about the wrong information that's been passed on by people that facial masks reduce oxygen saturation in people," said Lawton.
Lawton said that he had previously competed in three - thirds, but during the epidemic, he had suffered less.
On Monday, he ran a mile [35 km].
“I never took off the mask (no food or drink), and the oxygen saturation was stagnating 98% every time I looked at it, ” wrote Lawton on Twitter at the end.
Prince Joakim still in the hospital
Prince Joakim of Denmark is now in the University Hospital in Toulouse, France, and his condition is stable.
The prince underwent a brain surgery yesterday after having been diagnosed with a blood clot.
“ Prince Jehoakim’s condition is still stable.
The prince was blessed by professionals over time and feels good after incidents.
It is too early to say how long he will be in the hospital right now," said Lene Balleby, Danish Royal Hall Information Officer, in a written reply to the Danish government radio.
Only a few days have passed since the royal family celebrated the 18th birthday of Prince Felix the son of Jehoakim, his next son.
The birthday was celebrated in the Queen's vineyard, Château de Cayx in Cahors, South France.
When Jehoakim was hospitalized yesterday, the family was still on vacation.
Joakim, 51 years old, moved to France last year, where he is studying at Ecolé Militaire military school, the first Dana.

Accidents in Utah: Child and two adults died in a crash in a backyard
Six people were on board a Piper PA-32 plane that crashed into a backyard in West Jordan City on Saturday, according to Allen Kenitzer, U.S. Air Force spokesman (FAA).
Three of those on board died, including 43 - year - old pilot Lee Wyckoff, his 9 - month - old child, and Milda Shibonis, 36 years old, according to the West Jordan police.

Gottlieb warns that the sheer spread of the coronal virus in society makes it “very difficult” for schools to open in the fall
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, warned on Sunday that opening in a new year of study would be “very difficult” for school if the coronary virus spreads freely within these communities.
“ I believe that local school authorities need to examine the distribution within the community.
If the virus is spread unhindered in society, it will be very difficult to open up in that state," said Gottlieb in the Face the Nation.
Since the fall break will begin next weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools to students and to offer courses in schools five days a week.
However, these attempts by President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the coronary virus epidemic would probably “be worse before it improves” and confirmed that school conditions in which the worst condition might have to be postponed for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, a Center for Disease Prevention issued instructions on how to be more secure about opening schools for students.
Among other things, the guidelines call for a distance in schools between people who are loyal, students, and employees to use facial protection and for students to be divided into specific groups to reduce the number of infections.
However, the Centers for Disease Prevention did not publish criteria for school administrators as to when to close schools if coronal virus infections increase, which Gottlieb says has been “unfortunate. ”
“ When this uncertainty prevails and detailed guidance has not been given on how schools will be opened, ” he says, “I think more parents will be careful. ”
“That is why I think it is very important to get detailed information on the exact criteria, which the Centers for Disease Prevention did not provide in their guidelines.”
Gottlieb said a school example must consider the proportion of positive infections in the community, local distribution, and testing ability when deciding whether to keep schools open or to switch to online teaching.
If between 5 and 10 % of the analyses give a positive conclusion, "the matter is going to be a problem" but over 10 % is "the threshold when careful consideration is given to closing the school sentences."
“This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its foothold in society,” said Gottlieb, adding that this would do things of the Florida State, which is the center of the Korean virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open up to school education next month.
Coronary virus infections have increased in more than 30 countries and Colombia, but the middle of the epidemic is now known as the sunbelt on the south coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, however, said that there was evidence that there was a beginning to slow down the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
But even though Gottlieb had said that there was a “significant sign” that there was a slowing down of the epidemic in some countries in the sun belt, “heating in the coals” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India and Illinois.
Many governments have set rules that oblige people to use masks in public spaces and have stopped the phased reopening to stop the spread of the coronal virus.
Gottlieb said that states should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movie theaters, and other places that offer indoor entertainment, and setting rules on mask use to overcome the epidemic, which are measures that allow governments to avoid resuming the strict restrictions imposed at the beginning of the epidemic in March.
In addition to the use of masks by various countries, various companies have forced people to use facial shields.
McDonald's quick-bitter is the newest company to make use of facial defences and thus add to a group of companies like Walmart, Starbucks and others that have set their own rules on mask use.
Gottlieb said that he expected more companies to take on a mask duty, especially where the risk is considered to be high.
“If we can really control the epidemic when winter goes on until we get a vaccine or some kind of treatment that changes the clinical course of this disease, then we can do it with masks, it’s relatively simple, something we can all do, but that doesn’t change our lives and allows us to keep what’s very important to us, like keeping some companies open and getting the kids back to school,” he says.
Although Donald Trump did not want to use masks in the entire country last week, he urged the Americans to use facial protection last week and said at the White House news conference that “they had an impact. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson: "It's a story to expect."
The members of Crystal Palace received a call before the summer when Roy Hodgson, CEO of the company, declared it to be the visitor's cousin Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The elephant has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be leaving, as he has been said before with a team such as Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old he will find out whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay high sums for him, especially during the financial uncertainty periods of the sport this summer, after a period in which Zaha scored four bounds and made five supports for the Palace team which caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the season, Hodgson said that “there is news to expect ” about Zaha’s possible departure after confirming that the applicant had“ made it clear ” that he saw his future elsewhere than with the partner.
There are still three years left in the contract of the applicant with the Palace, and last year the Society indicated that 100 million sterling pounds would be needed for the Society to act.
The Hodgson team ended the period with seven consecutive losses and a tie on the last day of the period, which led to the death of the team to the 14th place.
Zaha found the net mesh only once from mid - December to the end of the long - shot period in the loss of Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for a sale last summer when he tried to get away from the company but no offer was made to tempt the Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, which seems to increase the likelihood of leaving the company, and in the next few weeks, he will have no doubt to take care of social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English elite section of the Palace during the season and was the only player under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team might be necessary to deal with the money available to the player.
Hurricane Hanna: The Texas-based Corona virus is at high risk of floods in 'twice shell'
Weather reports have predicted “flood floods ” in southern Texas after the Hurricane Hanna reached land twice and resulted in heavy rains and wind power up to 40 feet [40 m] per second.
When he reached the beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first-stage storm (bottom of five-point scale) and he has now been brought down to the tropical storm, but rain could still be 150-300 mm on Sunday and wind could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the Mexican border.
Hanna was the first hurricane in the Atlantic in 2020, and weather forecaster Chris Birchfield advised the people to be on guard: “This is not near the end yet, and we are still expecting floods. ”
In recent weeks, Texas has been struggling with a large increase in coronary heart disease.
The governor Greg Abbott published a disaster announcement for 23 circuits on the way to the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All hurricanes are a tremendous challenge.
This challenge is complex and even more difficult as the hurricane passes through an area that has become worse because of the COVID-19," said Greg.
The hurricane first landed at 5 p.m. on Saturday, 25 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, some 200 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christi.
The second shift was not far away, in East Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
Emergency services in Corpus Christi set up gardens near the intersections of the streets so that they can be used if flooded across the streets.
President Donald Trump of the United States was quick to say that the government was watching Hannah and Douglas, a hurricane heading toward Hawaii in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the shore of Corpus Christi, said that the approaching storm had increased her anxiety over the pandemic.
This 67 - year - old woman had remained at home mainly because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It’s almost like a double blow for us.
I think a lot of people are getting nervous.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong, and stand together."
Listening on a blazing cruise in the South
Listening in the South has been unusually successful in some ways because the weather has been favorable to farmers.
Most are finished with the first beat, another slaughter is widely launched, and it is estimated that some will reach the third stroke at the end of the summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers like other residents of the country during the summer and has not spilled its way on farmers ’ barrels.
Heyness has thus been successful.
Victory, son of Augustus, a cow farmer in Birtingaholic, Rrunaman Crowd, and a barber is happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been great, I think farmers just have to be steep, it’s been going fine because they’ve been very good weather for the last six months.
"Hyin is the very good end of the harvest good and the good of the hay good over," says Sigurður.
Victory says that it is growing, especially in the case of cow farmers, that they live in shallow pits or outbacks, which have given off very well, but it is by far the most important thing to do in roll - tailings.
“ It’s lively, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last six months or three weeks, it’s been so dry and good and then it’s so comfortable to deal with it.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be stored until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's brilliantly comfortable.
But does Victory think that any farmers will strike three times?
“Yes, I could quite believe it, those who were first.
We started on June 17th, it could be that those who were first had to take three times something."
The original solution of the wolves - this is how they prevent the injuries
Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English section, is a very fast player.
His adversaries have had it to grab hold of him to make sure that he does not get past them.
As a result, his shoulders have dropped several times, but now the wolves have brought a solution to the problem.
The Sun reports this.
In the Wolves game against Crystal Palace, the medical staff could see something lubricating on the shoulders of the Traoré.
“This is something we had to do to protect Traoré,” said a Wolves source, but what was being applied to him was child oil.
“ Making him a sluggard makes it harder for defenders to intervene, and so we can prevent further injury. ”
Traoré's shoulder first fell off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry England’s Prince: The Duke’s friend of Sussex refutes statements in a new book that has been between the teeth of people
In a conversation with Sky News, Stott said that the contents of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were in no way different from the content of the gossip, the only difference being that the book was bound up.
The former soldier wants the sea to be increasingly focused on the positive things that his wife and his wife have done, such as their charity work.
Stott said: “I don’t think what’s going on there is different from what we read in the gossip magazines, except now in a bound book. ”
“There’s a storyteller there, but there’s no certainty that this has come from them.”
"I think it's just another attack on them, just like the gossip magazines that persecute them."
“I realize that they are in the spotlight and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish they were more concerned with all the good things they have done and their charity, rather than their personal matters. ”
“ Of course, they never get out of it, because of their position.”
The support of the duke and the duchess of Sussex shone on other members of the royal family, according to an expert in the history of the royal family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the royal family had not been able to benefit from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s astrology.
She added that the rule of power within the royal family was fixed, but it was not possible to control the importance of public interest.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did in support of the queen tended to overshadow other members of the royal family, and that was considered a problem. ”
"They are very popular."
“ They had smaller weddings than most siblings in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But although Harry’s and Meghan’s weddings were smaller than William’s and Kathrina’s, the news was as much because of the world’s interest in the couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often regrets his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often regrets his reports on Twitter as a source of war.
On Friday’s interview with Barstool Sports, the president of the United States told him that his unattended reviews of Twitter events – some of which have contained material from the white race mind – would cause him the most trouble.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he could see for his posts, Trump replied: “Frequently, too often.
It was like this in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter saying that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, "Oh, how glad I am that I didn't send it," right?
But we don't do it on Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start getting calls — “Did you really say that? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you find out something.
Last month, Trump caused a great deal of anger after reproducing (divided material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages area of Florida, where an elderly couple called "White Power!" or "White Power Selection".
And in 2017, Trump re-issued three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the right-wing party Britain First.
The president told Portnoy that the rebirths that would have made him the most difficult.
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what the helmet is, which is a little bit and you don’t enlarge it, sometimes — I’ve found out that it’s almost always the rebirths that get you into trouble. ”
The president often shares praise for himself, for his opponents, and for his conspiracy with his 80 million followers on Twitter.
Trump says Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” on television shows and newspapers, which he says are falsely perplexed.
But the president’s own lies have often come under the microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s records are misleading.
The GPS system may be insecure
A lot of states are working on a different locational technique than the GPS system.
Engineering lecturer says that there may be a reason to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewing its life.
GPS technology follows us every step of the way.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, during surveying, industry, and leisure.
Most people think that it is a military device owned by the U.S. Army, which first opened it for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
GPS technology uses satellite coordinates at 20,000 miles [20,000 km] above ground, and thus conditions in nature have little impact on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the reception of these signals," says Sæmundur E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at Iceland University and expert on risk management and security in telecommunications.
He also says that it is easy to send error signals with a wrong location, such as in warfare.
“The GPS system is owned by the Department of Defense of the United States.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But certainly they can turn this off if it plunged into the head of a very wise president to have such a thing done, then he could probably do so," said Zemundur.
Thus, many countries have come to consider other systems and localization techniques.
Both the Russians and the Chinese operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is pushing off the Galileo location system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more accurate and naturally governed by the European Union.
Then it's not one government that's completely in charge of it, it's a lot of people," says Sæmundur.
But a lot of people are also looking back at the old loran technology.
Based on radio waves, it was used from the 1960s until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran signs are sent on a very long wave from the base of the earth.
“It is then a new version of the Loran system, called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that in many countries it is serious to consider having it as a system of protection, because it is a bit different to laws to interfere with it; it is far more difficult than interfering with the artificial system,” says Sæmundur.
However, it is probably safer to have access to as much as possible localization systems.
Senator Vern Buchanan, an experienced employee of the Crown Virus.
"Gary was a professional in the fingertips and a loyal servant of the public man," said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many and was loved and admired by those who knew him.
I will never forget how refreshing he was, the sense of humor, and the greater joy he had in helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a declaration earlier in the month that Tibbetts had had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan since 2011.
According to national health authorities, there have been 414,511 cases reported by the Florida Region since the beginning of the pandemic, which is more than the 411,200 cases in New York.
Data from the State’s health authorities show that hospitalization has increased by 79% since the National Festival Day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 intensive care units in Florida reached tolerances on Saturday.
"We were informed that this could have an effect," said DeSantis in June.
“ At the same time, police work and the imposition of sanctions could have a negative effect. ”
Flying from Hornefjord to Cape Town
Dry doves, rosethrowers, ring doves, cross noses, shingles, and tears are among the birds that have migrated here to land for the summer.
Nearly every day on the website of Birds of the South East you can see short news of the wanderings, where they have been seen and sometimes their sex.
They're a lot of bird lovers in Iceland.
To this end, the number of people who like the Facebook page of Icelandic bird species can be mentioned.
There are about 14,600 members of the group.
There, pictures of birds are shared, and it is obvious that Iceland is rich in good photographers who have the patience needed to produce birds.
Brynjulfur Brynjolfsson is one of them.
Aside, as he is called, a bird - watching officer in the South East and the South East Nature Office is a bird - watching station in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the life of Iceland and play an important role in it, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large and large bird of prey or a small sparrow.
It was founded in 2005 on the birthday of Half - Dán Björnsson, on the Kviskers in Eagles, with the aim of maintaining the air and continuing the significant natural research he conducted since 1940.
“ Half-death was 13 years old when he began to study information about birds, ” says Brynjulfur in a conversation with the Core.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly what Half Death did, but are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
Half - dead was a farmer and a translator, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote numerous scientific articles on plants, insects, and bird life.
He died on February 10, 2017, at about the age of nine.
Half - dead people and their siblings in the Quaestors aroused interest in many of the people they met in Icelandic nature.
Among them is Björn Gísli Arnarson, “the employee” of the Bird Research Center.
Björn grew up in the Reynvall, South Africa, and he was given a rich natural platoon by his neighbors, Half - Death of the Quakers.
But what is it that the Birds ’ Research Center in Southeast Africa does?
About March 20, each year, the Birds ’ Research Center will set up a special bird network in Einarslingn, a treelike lake near the Port of Horna.
There are standard markings on the birds that come into the net.
The nets are removed around May 10 at the start of the warp time.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six in the morning until noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released back into freedom.
Every hour, a journalist asks his forerunner.
“Yes, we share this with ourselves, Me and Bjössa.
Since we now have to work for ourselves, it can be a lot of puzzles, but somehow we can do it," says Brnojulfur.
The network is then reestablished during the period of August 1 through November 10 — all days allowed by weather.
Between watching the nets and the nonupstream seasons, Brynjulf and Björn are marking wares, foams, and various mosquitoes as they reach them.
In addition, they take on a number of special tasks.
One of these projects is carried out in cooperation with the Institute of Natural Sciences of Iceland and is about collecting forest mites of birds.
“ The forest mite jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then takes them here to land in the spring.
This happens shortly before they leave, and that's why these ticks aren't big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps off the bird and tries to find another host when he needs it."
But enough for ticks.
Asked how the birds in the South East were doing this summer, Brynjulfur says that the litter of the warhead seems to go well — where it covers the head.
“The war’s main tip here is at Hala in the South, where everything is going well.
But it is no longer to be found at Jack's Yearlon, since a few years ago there was a huge throw."
He says that a few years ago more than a thousand crickets were thrown there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
“When we look at moos and waterfowls, I feel that it has reduced the last few years how you feel about them.
But of course, there's always a change between years."
What can explain the great change is that Brno Christmas says that it is likely that there will be a supply on the table.
"It's all about food."
Then, too, man’s work may have his say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
Some birds, however, seem to have a pretty good time in the South East this summer.
“ One of the things that I think is good is that it is growing again after great depression, ” says Brynjulfur, “but during the last few years and decades, the cloud has plummeted. ”
From sparrows it is to hear that it seems that the lady woman is going to do well in her lap for the summer like last year.
The number of forest thrushes and dungeons had dropped somewhat, but Brynjulf does not say that until the fall how this summer proved to be.
But let's turn to the wanderers.
They often attract much attention, especially if they are very ignorant and even colorful.
These two interesting features feature one of the most popular summer wanderings: the Rose Star.
“Others have been relatively calm in the summer of the wanderings,” says Brynjulfur, but mentions that in the country there is now a cry and then a ring dove has been seen and is starting to lay here.
When Brynjulfur and Björn get to know the wanderings, they also mean them, as do other birds.
Meanings are international, and they are practiced worldwide.
Some can be identified by the meanings, such as the location, the location, and route of the birds ’ winter stations.
“ You can even see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjulfur.
This information is useful in many ways, to produce epidemics such as bird flu.
“ It’s always growing in knowledge. ”
If anyone in the world finds a bird that has been marked by a bird in the Middle East, the information is sent to Iceland’s Institute of Natural Sciences.
“We’ve been recovered from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a cricket we had marked.
One of us was found later in the United States."
One bird is Brynjulfi’s particular mindset, and it’s the foam.
"The foam is our bird," he says, pointing out that the Birds ’ Research Centre and its South-East Nature Laboratory have been assigned to monitor his offspring — which has become quite weak and is now on the list of wafers.
It is difficult to say what caused collapse in the trunk, but one theory is that the foam has made itself a seafarer that was previously afforestation by fishing vessels and out into the sea for good, but it is now much better to use and affects the sandals.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You don’t make me say no, of course, ” laments Brynjulfur, adding: “Since we are also chasing stray birds, we may have to go far. ”
True, the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“This area is like a trek into the country from Europe, and then the birds spread out of here.
Being here to see birds and eccentric birds is very interesting, but here is less to be found by birds of prey than in many other parts of the country.
It is not far from the distance and from the distance, so that the area as such is suitable for the inspection of birds."
But does Brynjulfur have a favorite bird?
He will think for a short time before answering.
That's a tough question.
"The nose of the sea is my bird, for I have found nine of the ten that have been seen in the land," he finally answers.
“I now find it most enjoyable to take pictures of horse stories.
It's always fun to find birds that haven't been seen before in this country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But they've both done that to your friends and Bjöss.
If you would like to monitor more closely the work of Binna and Bjössa at the Füglatskaptation South East, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the website Birdlar.is
Saudi Arabia – The Sun of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourism industry has grown enormously in many parts of the world in recent years, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want their share of the cake.
Consider the authorities ’ spending of some $20,000 billion (U.S.) to create a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the style that Iceland and I should get used to in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be available, and women will not be allowed to sunbathe in bikinium.
How, though, should tourists be lured into this rigorous Islamic country?
This should be done, for example, by building a new city where there will be white beaches, moons (of course made by humans), drone cars, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be brought to the oily land.
The Crown Prince says that it is not a question of women not being able to cover their shoulders and knees in public places, but at the same time admits that creating a tourist paradise in the country is not a simple matter because it is too hot when the sun is high and it cannot be relied on for wind.
But it may well be wondered whether it would not also diminish the interest of prospective tourists if they could not buy themselves alcohol.
Francois Bozize, formerly overthrown by the president of the Central African Republic
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been thrown down by a chair, announced on Saturday that he would be present in the presidential elections in December, despite the fact that the United Nations used punishment and that an arrest order had been issued for his alleged crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in front of a large group of supporters of his party, Kwa na Kwa (“Work, Only Work ”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old former general and military commander was removed in 2013 in the rebellion of the League of Nations, the largest Muslim rebels from the north, who plunged the majority of the nation into a violent civil war and a severe and long - lasting humanitarian war.
"The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction," said Bozize in a speech critical of the President's current office, Faustin-Archrange Touadra.
Bozize first took power after the election in 2003 and served as president for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for alleged crimes against mankind and for inciting genocide, but he has not been arrested since his return from exile in the last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign punishments affect his presentation.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to lift the punishments imposed in 2014 on alleged support of armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Today, Touadra is directing the country with the support of the comprehensive peacekeeping of the United Nations, which counts more than 13,000 military and police officers.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to volunteer for a different period of time, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace treaty with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, the number of violent crimes has been reduced, but there are still bloody incidents, most of which are caused by resource conflicts, but the majority of this diamond - rich country is not under the government’s authority.
The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The position of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is 'unacceptable to all', says Toni Kroos
Toni Kroos, middleman of Real Madrid, says that Gareth Bale’s position with the Spanish team is “unacceptable to all. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he participated little in the LaLiga celebration of Los Blancos, and now in the summer there is the situation that the player intends to keep still and let his contract run out, but the partner hopes that he will disappear on the track.
"There's no way to avoid the situation becoming unacceptable to everyone," said Kroos in the Lauschanschrift Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He wasn’t bought to play as little as he is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said 'yes' but then said 'no' later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry because of that.
When asked if the situation had had a negative effect on Real’s atmosphere, Croos said: “Not as much as it might be expected.
I've known him for six years, and we've worked together a lot of important things."
Chinese give the Reykjanes town 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the coronary virus
Chinese ambassador Jin Zhijian handed over two thousand face masks to the town’s mayor, Reykjanes, over a week ago.
The occasion was the visit of the mayor to the Chinese embassy on July 22, 1990.
The news of the week first reported.
The mayor’s visit was to make a refund of the Chinese ambassador’s visit to Reykjanesby, where he visited the town hall and met with the mayor.
News reports that the city of Reykjanes and Xianyang were discussed, but the communities began to cooperate between 2014 and 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is rooted in this friendly cooperation, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to give masks and thus support the fight against the coronary virus epidemic.
According to a news report from the World Wide Web, masks will be used in sensitive institutions and offices in the town of Reykjanes for both employees and other visitors.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the inscription on the mask box “Ber Is Behind, But Not a Brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculating to lower his salary
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from Iceland's KR, next month, and says he's gonna be interested by the partners in the Danish 1st Division.
Thomsen has been playing in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland's champion with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old visitor says that he misses Danmerk and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jacobsdaughter.
Danan’s contract with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that a Danish company would have to negotiate with KR about the price to get it in August before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise Thomsen would have to wait until the winter to get to Denmark.
“Yes, I know that the Danish departments start again at the end of August.
That means, of course, that I would have to cancel my contract with the KRs, but I've told them that I miss Danmerk, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to ball.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with the Rún Kristinsson coach, who had shown full understanding of the situation, and Thomsen said he didn't think the price would be a big problem.
“ I’ve also had discussions with two 1st Branches after that division was over and I knew where they would end.
There has been a little interest already in the coming period so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic division stops," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark that could buy up his contract with KR.
“It’s not quite clear now, but it’s been an interest.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on some things," said Thomsen, saying, "look first at the Copenhagen harbour.
Thomsen said KR-inga doesn't have to worry that he wouldn't give himself all the time to practice and play, even though he missed Danmerk.
“KR knows what it gets from me, and it’s that I do things 100 percent.
I can totally overlook the fact that I miss Danmerk when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says clearly that he will lower his salary by leaving the Iceland champions in the next section of Denmark.
“I’ll probably only have to lower my salary because of the chronic virus crisis, which seems to have shocked the Danish companies a little more than the Icelandic ones.
But I am also a student, and one solution might be to get a job.
Most of the 1st Division have an agreement with the sponsors.
I'm learning sports control through the playwrights' organizations and I'm finishing the bachelor's degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the first team of KR in two games in Pepsi Max during this season, but he has played five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven goals.
KR is an equal choice of points at the top of Pepsi Max and at the game for good, but KA is on Akureyri today.
Coping with the coronal virus on board a bus when a driver gets into a hot argument about a face mask
The video shows passengers and drivers on board an Arriva bus in Liverpool handling masks.
The driver can be heard explaining to a woman that it is not in his job to tell passengers to use a mask.
The driver said: “It’s not up to me to tell everyone who gets into the car to use a mask. ”
Said one Witness: “A man and an older woman started to care for her, and a lot of arguments broke out. ”
“ The driver had to leave his seat and came to ask what was going on, and he told one woman she wasn’t even using the mask right. ”
“That woman then pulled out of the wagon and said she was going to report the incident.”
Arriva’s spokesman said: “The security of our customers and employees is our priority.
"Our customers are obliged to use masks when using public transport (exceptional)."
"Explanatory instructions and meanings for customers on this matter and all other distance rules are on board busses, community media and on our website."
Mask duty has been in force in public transportation since June 15.
More than 16.3 cases of COVID-19 have been identified worldwide.
More than 650,000 have died.
More than 9,900,000 people have recovered from the coronal virus worldwide.
Most cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the United States, or more than 4.3 million.
Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to hire people with disabilities more often in role
The actress participates in a new effort to increase the participation of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The campaign is taking place at the same time as 30 years have passed since the United States Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, dated Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of people’s seeing themselves and their lives reflected in a real way on the screen.
"Nothing can replace personal experience and real publishing," she says.
“That’s why it’s so important to hire a suitable actor in an appropriate role. ”
Spencer discussed the effects of seeing skin - black people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the “Good Times ” feature.
The features shown at CBS from 1974 to 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they paved the way as the first comets to show two African parents.
Organisation Against Hunger Push Yoho aside after events in the Assembly Hall
WASHINGTON (AP) – No matter what Christian organization wants to end hunger, on Saturday they said that they had asked Congressman Ted Yoho to resign from the government of the organization, and that he had done so, after what they called the “attack” to Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, New York Congressman Demokrata, accused Yoho, Congressman of the Republic of Florida, of using a lowly and masculine slogan when he rebuked her when they met on the steps of the Congress Hall last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the quoted words, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the phrase had been as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that on Friday, Yoho’s government had met with him, and he insisted that he “would settle our commitment to being with women and skin - black people, domestically and globally, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
The Bread for the World website says that their “co - Christian voice ” pressured Congress and government to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty with sound public policies, the organization holds up the respect, dignity and concern that Jesus asks us to show when dealing with people in positions of power, wherever they are on the political spectrum, ” says the Declaration.
“In our opinion, recent activities and the words of Senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, do not reflect the moral requirements of our members of government. ”
At the time of the news, the spokesman Yoho had not responded to an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an amazing speech in the House of Congress last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said in a dramatic way about the incident and directed her words against what she called a men's anti-personnel teaching that "accepts violence and violent speech against women".
More than a dozen of her coworkers agreed that the incident was an example of too common men’s behavior.
Yoho described the incident as a brief debate on politics and that “no one had been bothered, harassed, or attacked. ”
He said he regrets having shown “a showy countenance. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in his first period as a progressive congressman and she has received both praise and shame for her cleanness.
At the age of 65, Yoho is one of the most conservative congressional councillors and will sit on a sacred stone after his fourth term of office.
Wait until 98 minutes in the local area to score the first goal of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or pitched into the English elite during this season, until he scored against Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final round of the league.
Since he scored twice against Cardiff in December 2018, Lingard had not scored in English.
He came in today as a substitute for Manchester United when Leicester was in a championship game about the Master's seat.
When more than seven minutes had passed the usual playing time, Lingard picked up the ball from Kasper Schmeichel’s goalie Leicester and scored the clear goal.
Jesse Lingard's long-term goal.
Real Madrid Players Oppose Disease Rules
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, Europe’s Master’s Department, without having to go into two weeks of sickness.
The British government has decided that travelers from Spain need to go for two weeks to prevent the spread of the coronary virus.
There are exceptions, however, as in the case of teams at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed the council of sports at Sky Sports.
The government says that those who are exempt from the rules will only be in a limited area, in front of a closed door.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and the media.
Thus, on August 7th, Madridninger can meet Manchester City without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2-1 down in the end after losing to Santiago Bernabéa on February 26th.
The victory team will continue in the 8th team finals held in Portugal.
The rain of the hail and the land of the holy places of merchants
Reports of overcrowded hotels and tent areas to judge, in the least south, show that Icelanders have been able to travel domestically this summer.
Have those who have landed at the same time been extremely lucky with the weather and weather forecasting DV agreed that the summer has been just said beautifully, until at least.
But now it is time for a shopping weekend that has been the most weekend of the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, since events that in the usual year have attracted a great many people not to be held.
Enough to give an example of a national festival.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but now there is a view of global rains, but especially south and southwest.
The weather room predicts a downpour from Thursday night to Saturday night at least.
It should be noted that long - term predictions are not sacred truth here on the North Atlantic and are likely to make changes.
In his prophecy on his weather tissue, Blinka, the meteorologist kneads Einar Sveinbjörnsson says that it is humiliated to expect the weekends of the merchants.
He says: In the attic with a common cold, which also goes down to the surface too often, the result is that when warm southwestern air tries to approach, it is only brought about by wind and wind.
Of course, there is also a warm air that “flies ” here to the north.
In support of his prophecy, Einar says: “A little wave from America travels to the east and with it summerlike air.
As it approaches, it reaches out to “flowering ” in the form of lower air pressure and considerable summer heat. ”
The great prophecy, the European calculator on the left, and the U.S. GFS predictions on the right are some of these developments.
The understanding of the subsidence is going over the prediction late on Thursday and early on Friday with a sharp A-field and rain in most of the country.
The 985 hPa medical kit will then be followed.
This time there will be some warm air in the North and East on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it could blow up.
You have been seriously injured when you drive with cattle selected in Wexford
One was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig Bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck ran to the bridge and struck a manless stationary car.
The 34 - year - old driver was seriously injured in the accident, which occurred at 13:50 a.m. today.
He was taken to the hospital in Wexford, where he is heavily held.

Chase an actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
"I was shot in her like a man gets so young," says Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir about Mariska Hargitay, the lead playwright and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so dismayed by the actress that she came to the scene and waited for her for hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir, the owner of the travel agency Pink Iceland, looked like many Icelanders at the show Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the turn of the century, she collapsed for Mariska Hargitay’s leading actress.
Birna tells the story of her and the actress's meetings in the play Love Stories on Council 1.
When Birna was herself a teenager, at the age of many people begin to develop intense love shoots, she did not experience it like her peers because she was struggling to suppress her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boy bands and young magical heartbreakers from movies, but she didn’t.
“ I was cutting pop sheets and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says that sometimes it is said that when people come out of the closet, they go through the late teens.
“ We spend our teenage years suppressing these teens, these shots, and so forth.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," said Birna about the actress.
“And there was something about her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her face."
When she was in New York a few years ago, the actress ran into a loop.
One of her best friends, Erling vontar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie there in the city and getting Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Guðjónsson, to assist in the shooting.
“We were working for 30 people and spending a wonderful time with strangers.
It's a natural, intimate atmosphere when you spend so much time together every day, so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a big fan of Mariska.
One of the women on the film team says that his friend knows the actress because he was part of the film team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend likes to work with the actress and whether Birna can get to meet her.
"She tells me to stop it, she doesn't know if she can let it happen," says Birna.
At the end of the movie, the group and Birna will try to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting.
"She had a few glasses and said she would just fix it."
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman asking if something is happening.
The woman does not respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning she wakes up with long - awaited messages.
“I watch the phone, and I scream.
Gunnar Helgi wakes up at the scream, and I say, "I have to take a shower, and I have to make myself nice and go down to town."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and film crew Law and Order were at a hotel in Times Square.
“I don’t know when they start or when they quit, but this is the name of the hotel, you walk well,” says the message, and Birna dresses up in a hurry, asking at the reception where the photos are and taking the elevator up to the 45th floor where the group is gathered.
Birna sits down and waits for a member of the staff to come to her and asks this uninvited woman if she can help.
"I say I'm looking for Jason and I asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland is here."
When the friend finally comes, he looks at Birna and asks how she got to the end of the line was supposed to be strict security.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to meet Mariska.
“Yes, I don’t know.
"Sit here," says the friend and Birna's laughing.
At her side, an extra player sits in the show, and they start talking.
"I say to him, I am a fan, but you?" says Birna.
“I played it as if it were the most natural thing in the world.”
We're running out of time. Pearna's waiting.
The players perform regularly when a break is made, they have snacks, and Birna looks around, looking for Mariska, which is nowhere to be seen.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he is leaving sadly.
Birna asks him to hand it over to another employee, since she did not consider going anywhere right away.
Amazingly, the friend agrees and gets another employee.
"He comes with his second friend and says, "This is the woman from Iceland who would like to see Mariska."
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“He says, ‘ Hurry! ’
It's an unusual situation today, there's reporters with her, so she won't stop.
She's going straight to the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go downstairs and find her trailer.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look to the right and I lose my face." Birna starts up and takes the elevator down to Times Square.
There she finds about forty traileres, some marked and some not.
However, Mariska’s trailer does not feel comfortable, and despair begins to creep.
“ I feel the breakdown pouring over me because I had spent half a day in this, but then I thought, well, I tried.
That was fun."
Wicked Pearna goes back to the hotel, where she sees through the window the camera team is looking at herself with pity eyes, and she realizes that Birna was not doing her job.
Bears accept fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under cover to cover myself from the rain.
Then I look to the right and lose my face."
No one but Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pantsuit, which she wears in the show, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move by emotional turmoil.
“I look at the body and my hands and now I think you have to move.
Now you must go towards her."
Pearna does that and dares to peck her shoulder on the actress.
“She looks at me and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello," Birna recalls.
“I say I’m from Iceland and a big fan.
She says, "It's so nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go much further because Mariska’s car is here, and it is whistled on.
Turning to Birna, Mariska says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Birna says goodbye to the deity, watches the car drive away, and then breaks down.
“ I called Erling and Gunna, and they thought that this had not been done.
But I was crying with excitement and joy.
I say, "Yes, I met her." You have to see me now.
Then we toasted in soda and tequila," said Birna.
She does not regret anything, even though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“It’s like this once in a lifetime, sacrificing such time and energy in making such a happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Birna Rönn Björnsdóttir on the part Love stories on Channel 1.
Police don't spread the virus.
There is no reason to worry that the coronary virus can be transmitted by means of alcoholic beverages used by the police.
This is said by a police officer in the police force in the capital area in a conversation with mbl.is.
Tips have been received from people who are concerned that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police get involved, get on the road, and let everyone who has a windshield go.
The police, however, say that the cleanest things are safe.
“ It’s not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend a cup that people blow in, ” said a police officer.
“Some people want to take notice of this, but we guide people to stay a little distance, up to a few dozen centimeters.”
Asked if it seems far enough, a police officer says it is.
If you try to show positive results, the police will use them in a different way.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is used only once.
Abdominal distension: Anise may be included to reduce pain
The connection to depression is not a coincidence.
People suffering from bowel inflammation, which is a disease characterised by abdominal pain, convulsions, flatulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening symptoms of the American Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
“This is because the zoster is partly controlled by the nervous system that reacts to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If your stomach does not decrease, you may have an intolerance to food.
The judge is trying to stop the ruling that children are being released from the immigration authorities.
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected deadline by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not need to release children if it is not possible to do so by any of the three means described in her previous order.
However, Gee also stressed the need for immigration and customs authorities to release their children without undue delay.
The three ways that Gee has proposed are to release families holding immigration and customs authorities, to place children in the hands of a responsible person, or to release families to the federal court.
Shalyn Fluharty, director of Proyecto Dilley, who provides legal services to families, condemned the decision and told it to give it to the immigration and customs authorities to decide whether children should remain in custody.
"The main thing to me is that children are kept temporarily and they don't get out unless the immigration and customs authorities agree or families agree to be taken apart," said Fluharty.
Families are kept in three positions of immigration and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley), and Karnes County, Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years of age, according to lawyers and legal advisers.
In June, Mr Gee, who supervises the implementation of the Flores Convention on the care of children in custody, said that since “rules on mask and social exclusion were not or are not well followed” it was urgent to move children from these places of work.
969 people detained by immigration and customs authorities have been diagnosed with the coronal virus and are in isolation or surveillance since 23 July, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 are confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in family detention centers.
Overall, more than 3,700 cases have been confirmed in detention
Will consider legislation on the independence of government officials
The prime minister does not say abnormally that life insurance funds set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
Notes from bankers to ensure the independence of the government's pension funds, possibly by law, will be taken into consideration.
Following the closure of the talks with the Icelandic Airlines Company and the resignation of all flight crew members, the government of VR declared that the directors of VR, which was the manager of the Lifelong Shopping Fund, were cheating or voting against the participation of the Lifelong Management Fund in the expected share capital of Icelandair.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of VR, went on to say that governments would be replaced if they did not comply with the recommendations.
Ragnar Thor withdrew his declaration three days later, and so did VR.
On Friday’s news, Ásgeir Jonsson, the banker of the bank, said in RUV that the independence of government officials would have to be guaranteed in the approved funds and possibly by legal amendment.
Prime Minister Katrin Jakobsdóttir says it is important that life insurance funds be independent, but it is already considered legally guaranteed.
“Now, of course, the Financial Supervisory Authority, which has done this, has said that it needs to look specifically at the regulatory framework around this independence, we will of course take it into consideration if something has to go over there,” she says.
Katrin says that according to the law, life insurance funds set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is desirable that it discusses the social and moral criteria that they want to highlight in their investments.
“ I didn’t think anything unusual was that life insurance funds also set criteria in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I think it's normal for such decisions to be made through a policy but not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.
'Unbearable traffic congestion at the Elfásár Bridge,' said the President of the City Council of Year
Helgi S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Year, says a traffic jam, which forms at the Elf - River Bridge on Selfossa daily is totally unbearable.
He hopes that a new bridge over the river Elfussá will open in the fall.
As Icelanders travel through their country, and there is a high traffic traffic on the country’s highways, daily traffic jams are created at Elf’s Bridge when drivers are on their way to Selfoss or through the township.
Long lines form at the edge and can take the patience of the drivers to wait in a row.
“Yes, it’s totally unbearable, it’s a traffic jam here and not just on Fridays, because it’s just in active days as well.
It's a long bath, sometimes quite on Hellish Island for those who want to get past here on their way east to land and those who are coming to the west, so it gives an eye way that we need to get a new bridge and no later than yesterday," says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the City of Årborg.
Helgi says that the city authorities in Årborg recently met with the head of the Road Service and the designer of the Road Service, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you’ve ever been optimistic that it’s been working on these issues, I think I can say it now because it’s really working on this and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being invited out in the fall.”
But is there any counsel for the drivers who are in wait at the bridge of Olives all the days of the summer?
"Yes, it is possible to go through the straits and through the Arch of Ears, it is speeding up, but those who are going to the east on the bow, it is not possible to tell them to go to the Valley of Ligdal, but those who are going to the uphills should use the Moselle Valley, the Dingual Plain, and the Hedge of Ligdal. "
Saint S. Haraldsson, president of the City Council of Year, says the traffic jam, which forms at the Elf - ulcer bridge at Selfoss.
A long prayer takes place every day at Elf’s Bridge, and drivers often have to wait a lot of time to cross the bridge.
Only then can we take a deep breath and think of something positive.
The future of the coral bear in northern Brisbane is being organized
The city government said that in addition to the vital home of the koal bears, the quirks, and the gray ghauks, it was an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Producers have called for the rejection of the municipal government to the Court of Justice on the basis of the fact that the building is in line with the law on urban organisation from 2014, would meet unmet organisational and social needs and would “be done without undue impact”.
There is a great deal of opposition to these planned projects in the local environment.
The operators argue that although the arrangement is fully consistent with the organization, it could be changed if it did not meet the requirements rather than reject it.
At present, the work involves many stages, including a service center, child care, and 39 homes.
Official submissions were over 120 in consultation, and most objected to the suggestion because it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
A minority leader in Brisbane’s city government said that the city would have to buy the land to protect the koal bear.
“[Court of Mayor] Adrian Schrinner has to stop wasting taxpayers’ funds in battle with the executioner for judgment and buy this country to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane,” said city councilman Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important home of koal bears in the Mountain to Mangroves natural area, where there are many coal bears.”
Schrinner said this week that the city government wanted to protect the koal bears in the area.
"We didn't think it was right for the area," said Schrinner.
“I understand that this is now going through the judicial system and obviously we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will preserve the home.”
Schrinner said that mapping the home of the koal bear is the shared responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the home of the koal bear that local authorities support when they make applications for treatment.
Sunshine: The next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, coach Man Utd, was hoping that the team would secure third place in the English elite today.
So the team will play in the European Championship in the next period.
United needed a tie or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2–0 victory of the Red Devils.
“A great achievement for the players to achieve third place according to the situation during the season.
I think that we boys might have gotten over a spiritual heel by winning such a big game, since we've lost twice in the first place during this period.
We knew we'd need a final today, now we can start the next chapter that's with these boys to win a title," said the Sunshine winner.
Manchester United still has the chance to win a title in this period, but the past in the European Union in August and is almost the best in the 8th season.
Disarmament begins at midnight in war - torn eastern Ukraine
Kiev, Ukraine — Ukraine’s army and opposition forces in eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete” ceasefire that will begin at midnight and that representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after six years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of the Resistance said that they had ordered their soldiers to cease their arms and issued a decree prohibiting the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said that its forces had "prepared" for the ceasefire.
If this were to be achieved, it would be "to give way to the implementation of other provisions" of the Minsk Peace Agreement, as declared by the President of Ukraine's office earlier this week, when the ceasefire was called a phase of time.
The aim of the Minsk Peace Agreement, which was made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separatists of Russia, which began in 2014 after the Russian invasion of the Krimskagan and the country’s support for the separatists.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
The presidents of Russia and Ukraine both welcomed the ceasefire on Sunday and stressed the importance of implementing the agreement reached at the Paris meeting in December.
President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, expressed concern at the request of Kiev that the Minks Agreement be reviewed and said that the position of Volodimir Selensky, President of Ukraine, on the 'unchangeableness of the Minsk Convention, which he again expressed in this call, should be reflected in real action'.
However, Selensky stressed the need to take further action to liberate the Ukrainians who are prisoners of the rebels in eastern Ukraine, the Cromskaga and Russia, as declared by the President's office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only have control over the borders of Russia in the territories that are under the control of the separatists once they have a wide range of self-government rights and when elections have been held in the territories.
The convention eased conflicts, but the Ukrainian army and the rebels have continued to fight.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December to hold other talks, support was given to the Minsk Convention and agreed to resume the peace process.
Selensky, who won the elections in 2019 with the promise to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to have control of the borders before the first regional elections, but the Kremlin government demands that the treaty be concluded without any change.
The new armaments pool was reached on Wednesday before the creation of a three-sided team, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was thus welcomed by EU officials.
The traditional Sunday blessing on St. Peter’s St. Francis also mentioned the ceasefire, saying that “it would have to rebuild trust and lay the foundation for so much needed and long - lasting peace with the people. ”
Police: A man shot to death at protests in Texas
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A man was shot to death in protests in Texas as he approached a car and the driver in the car fired his weapon, according to the police.
The police spokesperson Katrina Ratliff told the newsmen in early Sunday that the shooting had taken place just before 22:00 at a protest in Austin.
The man was transferred to a hospital where he was later sentenced to death.
The car had whistled, turned down the road and then speeded the journey towards the Protestants, told witness Michael Capochiano to the newspaper Austin American-Statesman.
According to Capochiano, the man, who had a rifle on him, approached the vehicle and was shot by the driver.
The driver then drove away, said Capochiano.
Ratliff told the newsmen that the first reports indicated that “the victim might have had a rifle ” and added that the suspect was in custody and was willing to cooperate with the police.
According to newsrooms, the group had gathered for the Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday.
The protests were streaming directly on Facebook, where they were heard in the whistle of the car and a few shots fired.
Market Soup in July’s First Win
A moment later, his first victory of June 29th, when the IA was defeated, 5–3, in the Pepsi Max Division of Men at Copavogsveld tonight.
In contrast, Skagermen lose their third game in a row in the league.
After winning the first three games in the league, Broadway played five games without celebrating victory and had lost three in a row before the game at the IA tonight.
So it was to do or to die for Blika, who came into the game with great power.
Alexander Helgi the son of Sigurðar led the team in a fine settlement at 11 minutes after the Christian son of Steindor had sent him through the defense of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the lead after the fine preparation of the Gísla son of Eyjólf on the left.
Skagers did not get to land or shore in the first half of the game, where the local blackmail made them extremely difficult for connecting shipments.
The binoculars had all the power on the field and reaped the third goal at 36 minutes when Daninn Thomas Mikkelsen balded the horny hovel of the Gunnlaug son.
Then, just three minutes later, Christin Steindor’s son scored his second goal, and the fourth mark, Blika, was scored.
The story of the first half game, however, did not end there.
The next day, when Triggvi Hrafn Haraldsson scored out of a fight just before a playoff, Kwame Quee had broken clumsily on Viktor Jonsson inside the pond of Blika.
Thus, 4-1 was the position for the moment of Widening when the half-squat was bile.
Only three minutes had passed by the second half when the Skagen scored again.
At that time, Sjövar Jonsson was alone and unelected on the market in Blikah and easily steered the ball into the net after Tryggva Hrafn Haraldsson.
On the other hand, listening became a criminal offense within the stretch of the IA just three minutes later when he broke on Alexander Helga.
The Viitaspilner was convicted, and Thomas Mikkelsen scored with confidence to make a 5- to 2-year break after only seven minutes of the second half.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen’s goal, Skagamen scored again.
Anton Ari Einarsson, Blikah’s goalkeeper, put them under pressure from Viktor Jonsson, gave the ball to Viktor’s foot, from which the ball was turned down in the net.
Unbelievable 5 to 3 positions were observed when less than 10 minutes had passed by the second half, but this slowed down on the next target score.
Despite being able to add to both teams, including the two death chances of Kwame Quee, they won no more, and the 5–3 win of the game's Broad-Looking Final.
A moment later, with his first victory in less than a month, from June 29th, the victory is over with 14 points in third place, two points from Val, which is above and three from the top team of KR.
However, both KR and Valur have a game in their midst.
The IA has to accept the third loss in a row in the division, but the team has ten points in the eighth, five points from the fall.
Puppets are not in danger despite the White House’s comments
Yesterday, the producers of the Huppas Federation were right not to stop showing the baby in the near future.
The statement follows on from Kayleigh McEnany, White House media representative, that the elements that deal with law enforcement dogs, among other things, were the victims of "cancel culture".
Canadian producers were quick to respond to McEnany’s words and stated that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Puppy League.
A number of television series dealing with police activities have been taken out of the U.S. recently following a protest against police violence.
The pups, however, are not included, even though they have spoken in social media.
At a press conference in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump of the United States was opposed to “exclusion culture ” and especially when the police came.
The term refers to a person’s or a company’s speech or actions that induce a strong reaction to the media and calls for a person to be cynical in protest.
“We saw a few weeks ago that shows on the Huppas team, children’s stuff about cops, had been stopped.
Likewise with Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took out a law enforcement post, but there is no foot for the claim that Lego’s defenders said it was.
However, it is true that the reality features of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of the show there in the West.
Among other things, both actors are disputed for displaying footage of real police jobs without permission from individuals appearing there.
Together for 29 Years - Sometimes jealousy and skepticism arise
Christian Thomas daughter of a family therapist answers the reader’s questions about family, children, and love in the DV family corner.
This time she answers readers who have never been single.
We’ve been together since we were 15, we’ve been together for 29 years, and we have two children.
We know nothing but being together and feeling good, but we have both felt as if we were missing out on something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparisons as to how this could be different.
This has sometimes led to jealousy and distrust when it comes to whether the other person is looking around, thinking about adultery, even divorce, and changing.
When we discuss this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but it is such a nightmare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question, and I'm glad you're having such an open relationship that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would frighten me would be if you were thinking about this in each corner, couldn't talk about this and even take some steps that you could so later regret.
Everything on the table, isn't it always best?
Strong self - image has the greatest foregleam of happiness in the future and the stronger your self - image, the more likely you are to have a strong self - esteemed marriage mate.
The reason why relationships that start in adolescence do not always last for the rest of their lives is often the fact that people grow in each direction, but in those cases where there is a greater impact, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to develop in your most formative years, you may conclude that you have grown together and have a positive influence on each other’s image.
We are molded by our relationships.
The way I speak is shaped by the way you listen.
The way I show myself depends on the way you see me.
Relationships shape who we are.
Could you turn around and think: ‘ What do we have that others do not have? ’
What does this many years of specialty give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be far more than the flaws.
You have shaped each other for years, and as a result, you can say that you are custom in millimetres each other.
That's more than many people can say.
It's worth it?
You say that you feel that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also accompanied by accompanying fish for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be missing out on starting over, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and putting together families.
This brings new challenges, different problems, and potentially new and exciting challenges.
But not only does this come with pink cloud and happiness, but at your age it can become a very complicated task, which may never be as good as you've already done to each other.
Is that worth it?
Would it not also be wise to focus on what you can do to increase tension, lack of vision, and new ones in your relationship?
You haven't put your shoes on the shelf yet.
There are so many things you can do to make your long relationship even deeper.
What efforts can you make in connection with that?
What do you need from your mate you are not receiving?
What can you give to your mate who you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Would you like to try something new?
Today, there is much more tolerance for various forms of communication, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multicultural love, or a temporary breakup.
I'm not telling you at all what to do, but no expert in your solutions, but possibly it would ease those heavy fat that'll come over you, if you look into this and think about solutions.
What then do you need to be distrustful and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, that must mean you're good at things together.
Take advantage of it as strength and hold your hand toward your deliverance.
We encourage readers to send their questions and misgivings to Kristina by e-mail at: heonabandssala@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the family corner, of course, without name and in full confidence.
Lost the cup and crushed it

It's a war!
Coleen Rooney advises lawyer Johnny Depp on the Wagatha Christie rhyme at Rebekah Vardy
Coleen Rooney has asked David Sherborne to defend himself against the charges of murder against Rebekah Vardy
After conversations between the footballers ’ mates broke out, their acquaintances expected a dramatic comeback.
Coleen Rooney has hired the astrologer in Johnny Depp's reported case of injury to defend himself in his so-called Wagathe Christie legal dispute with Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday simulates that Rooney has ordered David Sherborne to defend herself against the accusation that she has been injured against Vardy, with claims that personal information has been leaked to the media of her closed Instagram access.
A few days after the submission of data to the Supreme Court, the news is that Rebekah Vardy, married to the contestant Jamie Vardy in the Leicester City football team, suffered physically and spiritually from Coleen Rooney’s claim.
The paper says that the five children of the 38 - year - old mother “had severe panic attacks and panic attacks, so she was afraid to leave the house ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months away,“ had been hospitalized three times ... because of an anxiety attack caused by the transfer and its consequences. ”
In addition to being the attorney for Depp in his lawsuit against The Sun, because of the claim that the actor beat his wife, Sherborne, 50 years old, goes with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in their private case against Associated Newspapers, publishers The Mail on Sunday.
After the conflict between the two footballers failed, those who knew about a dramatic settlement in the courtroom were expected to do so.
"If you thought the Depp trial was a game of sight, don't underestimate the future war of football owners," said one author.
"Now it's a real war, Coleen doesn't give up, and Becky doesn't either, it's gonna be emotional."
Coleen Rooney argued that someone who used Instagram access Rebekah Vardy had leaked fictional stories about her for a newspaper.
She was named "Wagatha Christie" after she explained how she spent five months gradually limiting the number of friends who could see updates to her Instagram stories, until only Vardy's account was left.
Coleen says that they've put a igneous story on Instagram, which had then appeared in a gossip magazine.
In Vardy’s pleadings, which deny participation in the case, she argues that after Rooney published the accusations, she has been made a bloke with the aim of causing great harm and enormous suffering. ”

Biden's cosmopolitan team rejects Fox News Sunday for an interview one week after Chris Wallace's interview with Trump
In Trump’s interview with Chris Wallace last week, President Trump of the United States doubted that the expected President of the Democratic Reformation, Joe Biden, would be in charge of the flood of questions Wallace dropped on Trump.
We may never get an answer to that question — at least not for now.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that Biden’s campaign team had told Fox News that he was “not available” for an interview.
"In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent in the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, would plummet in similar circumstances," said Wallace.
“In the week, Biden’s campaign team asked for an interview, and they said that the former vice president was not free. ”
"We continue to ask questions every week," he added.
Trump’s campaign team has for months criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and a press conference while he attends interviews during the coroner’s virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently resumed his campaign, Trump and his associates have continued to mock the former vice president for “hidden ” at their home in Delaware.
However, the reluctance of Biden to attend public events has not damaged his presence, as recent surveys show that Biden has a good advantage over Trump, both nationally and in major states.
Real Clear Political averages indicate that the president was 7 percent in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all four states in 2016 as he turned them over to the Republican Party when he won the White House battle.
In Fox News Poll’s latest survey, Biden has a head start in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, out of the loop in all cases.
Studies also suggest that Biden has a slight advantage in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important battle states in these elections.
And research suggests that a once - solid Republican fortress, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trump and the former vice president.
Presidential elections in which the President-in-Office will present himself during the second term of office in the White House are often a vote on the President — and this seems to be the case now in 2020 in the battle between Trump and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the coronary virus and the economy, which are depleted by the epidemic — and the presentation and history of the president in both classes.
Kanye West and his wrestling with psychosis
Today, musician Kanye West apologized to his wife, Kim Kardashian.
The head of mental - health professionals believes that he draws his creative powers into his mind, but a psychiatrist says it is important that people take drugs to control the disease.
The rapper Kanye West is not only one of the earliest and most influential musicians of the day, but is no less famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
Much of his personal life has gone before open tents.
Earlier this month, he announced that he was being modestly presented to the presidents of the United States and gave a heart - to - heart talk.
Later, some strange noise appeared from him on Twitter, where he claimed, among other things, that his wife was trying to have him hospitalized.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram asking people to show their husband and family understanding; he had bipolar disorder, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek help himself.
He has since apologized publicly to her.
This famous family is not alone in coping with this problem.
It is thought that about one percent of people get a mental breakdown.
Ferdinand Jonsson, head of mental - health clinics in London, knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so much depression for individuals and especially their families and loved ones.
This masculinity, or mania, can ruin relationships and work and cause tremendous sorrow.
And then the other side, the depression, it's often very dangerous, because there's a high rate of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was nice for her to say that.
And it's just human and human," said Ferdinand.
The head of mental - health assistance named Unnsteinsson has himself struggled with a mental - health situation — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very cheerful imagination.
If we are four strands of terrestrial double bass, he is an hundred strands of heavenly harp.
And he's so incredibly creative, extremely powerful and clever in his powerful connection idea, because you'll be aware of this connection thought that we've been able to try to go into a state of masculinity so well-known."
Kanye West doesn't want to take mental drugs, because he thinks they're detracting from his creativity.
He's been talking about the lunatics, including on the album Ye.
He says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“Many feel that it binds this creative element of this unbridled connection and superlative creative power of the fire he has, but then the natural flaws of that often are great suffering, and the calamities and dark cellars and darkness.”
Ferdinand, on the other hand, says that bipolar disorder is an important treatment.
“ If you have a lot of masculinity or mania, you’re not making any great things, you’re just on the side.
And as when people go into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you'd advise Kanye West to take medicine?
"Finally," says Ferdinand.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dosage and this way to make a balance between helping him the most, and ruining that remembers him and his abilities and his creative power.”

Delhi Metro throws the first pillar at the fourth stage of execution
Delhi Metro reached an important stage in the fourth stage of the operation when the first pillar was cast for the route between Janakpuri West and R K. Ashram Marg, which is being laid, according to employees on Sunday.
The pillar was cast in Keshopur and on an elevated part between Keshopur and Mucarba Chowk on Saturday night.
"Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) took another important step at the fourth stage of the operation when the first pillar at this stage of the extension of the train system was deflected by the route between Janakpuri West and R K Ashram Marg," said DMRC.
This 'important stage of implementation' was achieved in spite of a high shortage of labour and other organizational challenges caused by the pandemic, according to employees.
The average height of this column is 10 meters.
However, the pillars will be at a height of 20 metres at Madhuban Chowk, where the route will be along route 1, and at a height of 25 metres at Haiderpur Badli Mor, where the route will be on route 2.
At Haiderpur Badli Mor, the 28 - foot - high [28 m] highway, which is the highest altitude in Dehli Metro’s history, says the Declaration.
The highest point of the train system is at Dhaula Kuan, where the bridge path leads 7 to 23.6 meters [23.6 m].
In the context of construction engineering, pillars are vertical, stress - bearing structures that support the near end of two pathways.
They form a vertical structure that supports the elevated highways of the train system.
These trains can be seen on the countless highways under the Deli train system.
The number of the pillars is now playing an important role in identifying addresses in the Deli metropolitan area.
The 28.92 km long route from Janakpuri West to R.K. Ahsram Marg is an extension of the Magenta route and will stop at 22.
21.18 km from the road will be raised and 7.74 km from the ground.
Construction work for this part began in December of last year.
On July 17, work began on the underground section of the road at the time of the construction of a tumult wall at Krishna Park Extension train station.
On June 24, DMRC started to shed U-cargo bits that would later be placed in the elevated part of the route.
In the fourth phase of the project, 61.679 km of the new trainway will be provided with three different routes with 45 stations.
These new items will offer connections between the parts of the train system that Delhi Metro is already operating.
Of these, 22.35 km [22.35 km] below ground, while other parts will be elevated.

"A paranoid" ambassador wants a gun, an armored car, and a stab-vessel - said sub-men are the ambassadors of the "deep state"
The U.S. Secretary of State, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry a gun on CBS news today.
Says CBS: “Despite being located in one of the safest states in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been “weaningly” about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
In addition to individuals familiar with the subject, CBS refers to 12 diplomats, government dragons, and former representatives.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand that the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs request permission from the ambassador of the paramedics to march in arms here on land.
He should also have wished for an armored car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and a stabbing vest.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to express itself as to the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador was told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
However, a bodyguard would have been advertised in Icelandic newspapers, CBS says, and if it had succeeded in meeting the ambassador’s demands.
CBS reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, according to their sources in this country, the U.S. news agency has said that there was no wish for it to be heard by local governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of as walking about armed because it would insult the guest state, Iceland.
The ambassador was rewarded for having given generous support to Donald Trump's election fund in the 2016 presidential election.
He used to be a skin doctor in California.
Since Gunter took over in May, when he said that he had created an “impossible ” working environment in the embassy and had already had seven subs, known as the Deputy Chief of Mission, the ambassador’s subordinates, who are also sent out diplomats.
They were all tried and tested diplomats from the U.S. State Department.
The first one was sent away by the ambassador “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
Had already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one lasted only six months.
After that, a rotation of staff was made and the idea was to make Gunter look at one of them as much as he could until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter expects the members of the mission to go on the agenda of the “deep state ” and to bury him against the State Department in Washington, D.C.
The authorities of the D.C. Department of Foreign Affairs are well - aware of the situation in their embassy in Reykjavik, but have been reluctant to intervene in the control of the embassy in the light of Gunter’s relationship with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the orders of the State Department in Washington, and when he said he refused to return to D.C. during the Covid-19 epidemic.
He left the embassy in the hands of his staff for months.
When he said he was going to work from his home in California unless ordered by the Secretary of State himself, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Turning back on end
Having finally received the order, Gunter turned back to Iceland in May.
His new deputy, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their requests to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The State Department didn't want to communicate with CBS, nor with the DV.
Gunter is one of the many political ambassadors of the Trump government, who have noted unusual behavior in recent months.
In order to produce a hard reaction, Woody Johnson noticed that he was trying to move the British open championship in a golf course in Trump’s possession.
At the same time, the ambassador in South Africa has been charged with firing his number two and then trying to appoint her son to the job.
42% of U.S. ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politicalally appointed to Obama's government, and 32% to George W. Bush's government.

Poland will tell itself about the European Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women
The Polish authorities say that the country will withdraw from the European agreement to prevent violence against women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legal act of the world that aims to prevent violence against women than the Polish Minister of Justice Zbigniew Ziobro describes the text as “harmful, ” demanding that schools teach children about sex from a sociological point of view.
This weekend, Ziobro said that on Monday, he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country to report on the contract.
“This ideological element is linked to attempts to change education in schools and leisure, to study, attitudes and beliefs of the young generation of the Polish people, based on the conclusion that we believe is wrong, that biological gender is old-fashioned and that everything is really about social culture.”
Ziobro believes that the provisions of the agreement on the education of children and young people as well as family ties in the context of LGBT people are unacceptable.
"We also reject the LGBT elements in the discussion on family ties, because this is an opinion held by left actors or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws," he said.
On Sunday, the Council of Europe said that it was “anxious” about Poland’s secrecy about the contract.
On Friday, about 2,000 people protested in Warsaw, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, apart from the offices of the right - hand association Ordo Luris, who support the country’s declaration of the treaty.
"We won't be victims," they called them.
Objections were also expressed in other cities in Poland.
Poland signed the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence in December 2012 and ratified it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a mechanic at the Palace of Honor, dead 81 years
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, part of a quarter - mile [4 km] race empire that included Lee’s father and Richard’s brother, who was the first engineer to be taken into the Nascar House of Honor, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family didn't give up his cause of death.
His funeral has not been reported.
While other members of his family were praised for their abilities behind the wheel, Maurice Petty won the nickname "Chairman" for his abilities with the screw key.
He helped his family win 198 races and seven titles in NASCAR, and he also built machines that guaranteed Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton victory.
"The manager was one of the best mechanics in NASCAR's history," said the manager and managing director Jim France.
“ He came with the strength that helped Petty Enterprises to gain their advantage in the field of sports.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hood, he also performed various roles behind the tents and did what was necessary to get his cars on the winning track."
Maurice Petty was born on March 27, 1939, in Level Cross, North Carolina.
He followed his father on the racetrack when he was little, and his knowledge of mechanical engineering soon became a vital factor in the victory of Lee Petty in the 54 races and three championships.
He competed 26 times in the NASCAR Cup between 1960 and 64, was seven times in the top five seats, and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what would happen under the hood rather than behind the wheel, which proved to be a good track for his older brother, who relied on his machines for his victory.
Richard, then known as the King, won the first championship title together with the Governor in 1964 with the Plymouth driver.
They again won 1967, two years in a row in 1970 and 1971, and reached three more titles before the end of the 1970 ’ s.
With these seven titles on their back, they share the highest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“Maurice Petty was one of the true pioneers of NASCAR and was involved in his career at Petty Enterprises in building one of the NASCAR top teams,” said Winston Kelley.
“ Although Petty is registered as 212 he is entitled to well over 250 victories, if taken with all the machines he built for his competitors.
The boss will be remembered forever as the best machine in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and in 2014 Patricia, Maurice Petty’s wife, died.
He was also the uncle of the former motorist and the mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, deputy director of the truck race.
“Although we now greet Maurice Petty, one of the true and effective pioneers and heroes of NASCAR, his legacy and name will be preserved in our memory, held up and preserved forever,” said Kelley.
"We sent our deepest condolences to the Petty family."

I want to thank every fan for the support over the years, the partner for giving me the opportunity to be dressed in blue, and my teammates.
You will always take place in my heart.
Let's go get the FA Cup!

Serbia wants to increase military aircraft in increasing tension in the Balkans
BELGRAD, Serbia (AP) - Serbia will strengthen its army and seek to buy more military planes as tension increases in the Balkans, said the president of Serbia on Sunday.
President Alexander Vucic said that “certain requisitions ” were in the process of buying fleets of fighters, accusing the United States and other Western states of having armed the neighboring countries of Serbia, which are in NATO, as well as Cosovo, which were formerly districts of Serbia.
"The Americans, the Turks and the Germans take good care of their beloved source," Vucic said and referred to Kosovo.
He said that the United States had recently handed over a number of armored cars to Kosovo security forces.
On a tour of the Serbian army tankers’ squad, Vucic said that his people could not compete with NATO’s armaments and that “that is why we are up against ourselves. ”
Vucic did not specify the type of Serbian military aircraft that he intended to buy, but government officials say that his government has officially requested the release of 20 U.S. attack aircraft.
It is stated that no response was received from Washington at the request from Belgrade and that it is likely to be refused, that an attack aircraft of the type Sukhoi-25 from Russia will be purchased.
Serbia, which advocates neutrality in military matters, has recently been provided with a highly developed air - protection system from Russia, which has also provided military jets, attack helicopters, and armored vehicles.
China, also an allied nation of Serbia, has given up the state for military use.
The United States officials have openly discussed the introduction of sanctions against Serbia if more weapons are launched from Moscow, especially weapons that could endanger the security of neighbouring NATO member states.
In the Western and neighboring countries of Serbia, people are concerned about Russian and Chinese armaments in Serbia.
The tension is increasing in the Balkans, where civil war was fought in the 1990 ’ s.
The Atlantic Alliance was involved with Serbia to stop the bloody acts of Serbia against the apartheid Kosovo-Albana in 1999.
Despite formal efforts to join the European Union, the populist leadership of Serbia has further strengthened its political and military relationship with the Kremlin and Beijing.
Serbia, as well as Russia and China, does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, which the United States and most Western countries have recognized.
Heart attack: A risk of this fatal disease can be reduced by eating chocolate once a week
A new study suggests that certain benefits may be beneficial for the heart muscle.
How could this reduce the risk of a heart attack?
Scientists have conducted a meta-analysis of coronary artery disease over 50 years of age.
The main symptoms of coronary artery disease (also called ischaemic heart disease) are three: chest pain (angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms may include palpitations and excessive shortness of breath.
“Sucrose contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxanthine, polyphenol and steric acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high - density lipoproteins, collects and transports “bad” cholesterol — a type of cholesterol that narrows the arteries of the heart.
The “bad” cholesterol (low-fat protein) is broken down in the liver and is then removed from the body.
However, the new study does not investigate the dose or type of chocolate consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or other cocoa confectionery.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the consumption of cocoa (which is found in chocolate) reduced the risk of a heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular activity refers to how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients around the body and carries waste away.
Life-style factors were not mentioned in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said about the data that those who had admitted to eating chocolate were more likely to have healthy body weight.
She added that they could exercise regularly and feel less stress.
"Each of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system," she added.
Coles trades plastic toys outside books in a new collection campaign
“ We’ve really listened, and it was a key element in the preparation of the project, ” Ronson said.
“We don’t believe that people want to recycle the books – we think they will want them, but they can recover them at home if they want to.”
Ronson said that the new campaign had been under way long before the COVID-19 came into existence, and despite the epidemic, she believes that the time of the new campaign was “a little good ” because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
Researchers have expressed concern that consumers are getting tired of ever - growing toy - collecting campaigns of the largest supermarket, but Ronson says that there is no sign of fatigue yet.
“We haven’t seen anything like this yet, but we have our eyes constantly open to it,” she said.
“We report a great deal of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we give up agrees with our customers.
It was Cloes who paved the way for gathering campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first one in mid-2018 was the driving force behind the best quarter of the market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed up with Lion King Osheis, who also helped the supermarket to increase its sales, and now lastly, the environmental campaign Discovery Garden offers customers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new campaign could have less impact this time, as UBS analysts predicted an increase in sales by wholesalers in Australia during the largest part of the 2021 financial year.
Ronson said that customers can expect more diverse campaigns in the future and that campaigns such as Little Shop are likely to be less frequent.
“ There’s a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we’re looking at, and we’re always getting inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do this to ensure that we constantly do better to our customers.”
5 laps around the country this summer
The photographer and material manufacturer Jon Ragnar Jonsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, has been more and less of a wander around Iceland since the pandemic.
Jon graduated from the University of Reykjavik Business School a few years ago, but now he is working on traveling and producing marketing materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early at Jon’s, or in April, when he traveled all over the West Forest and stayed in his car.
For the rest of a year, he has gone about five or six laps around the country.
In addition, he has traveled innumerable days here and there.
What journey has taken place?
“ For someone like me who’s always on the move and has seen everything, it’s hard to name a favorite place.
It's the more weather and the company that matters.
Recently, after their roads opened in June, they have gone a lot uphill.
These journeys always stand up because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip of the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 big cars up the riverside and from there to Lake Álfta."
What's ahead of you this summer?
“ I’m very excited about this, but I just finished a scuba diving course with DIVE and now take a dive here and there around Iceland.
Then I added a surfboard to my "touch bag" so I'll be more out in the sea than before.
I am so heading for a ten - day solo journey with everything I need my back, but it turns out later in the summer.
Otherwise, I'm going to be a lot up on the highlands in the near future because you can't look at that area all year long."
What place is your favorite in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose a place, but the Jack’s Year’s Award has been a part of my life since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I lived at the foot of the Brethren Bridge, and since then, I have always felt good in that area.
I think it's safe to say that I've been there over 100 times."
What place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“I’m going to bring one pearl from every part of the country, but it’s: Mulagluves in the South, an East Plain, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, Red sand in the West, Snowflake in the West, and last but not last...
What is essential on the move?
“I don’t go out on land unless I have the following in my car: good flashlights, hangars, lopapeys, hunting knives, fireplaces, refrigerators and Voids... those who know me know what I’m talking about.”
Seeking 24 rowings afraid of drowning from an island in Malaysia
KUALA LUMPOUR, Malaysia (AP) — On Sunday, the Malaysian authorities said that 25 rowers who fear drowned after jumping off a boat off the tourist island of Langkawi, north of Malaysia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high - ranking police officer in Malaysia, said that only one of the 25 rowers who had jumped off the boat had been able to swim to land.
The man who survived sought help from the police late on Saturday and was held while the case was under investigation, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim settlers have fled Myanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh.
The majority of the inhabitants of Malaysia are Muslims, who have been a frequent destination for boaters who promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airways were used for the search.
He said that the territorial sanctuaries will also alert the local and local authorities in the neighboring country of Thailand so that they can assist in the search.
He didn't provide any more information about the boat.
During the last month, the authorities in Malaysia detained 269 rowers and found bodies on board a suspected boat that had been used for smuggling off Langkawi’s coasts, but they claimed that he had been deliberately injured so that he could not go back to sea.
Malachish later said that the 269 individuals had been taken out of a larger ship with dozens of people who were thought to have died and their bodies thrown into the sea.
The prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, said that Malaysia could not accommodate any more peacekeepers, since it is struggling with the economic downfall of the coronary virus epidemic.
He said, however, that those already in the land would not be sent back to sea.
In Malaysia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to some 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers — including 101,000 rowings — registered with the United Nations Office of Refugees.
People in Aswan collect, watch, and return cargo of chocolate to Sudan after a car load
On Sunday, at the crossroads of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a coma because of a heat stroke, the transportation car to Sudan with many tons of chocolate fell on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple.
The townspeople grouped to help the driver where he was lying and rescued the goods that had been raised.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver was “passing past our village; we could not just stand by.
We're supposed to help people in distress, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had come on an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the truck’s cargo, estimated at three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said that the villagers had been in the field from morning till evening, saving as much of the cargo as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the cargo and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the damaged driver with water and shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted to make sure he got to and fro from the village safely.
There were already casualties in Congress, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
“The global epidemic alone calls on our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we expect in times of difficulty,” says a report produced by Leonard Steinhorn, professor of communications at American University, and Mark Sobol, author and organizational development and management expert.
“But we are also faced with other divisions of debt that concern our nation’s inherited sin and the racial inequality that has plagued our country from its institution. ”
The study examines familiar material related to the pitiful situation of the Congress: lack of real links between categories, schedule limiting opportunities for communication, over-compression of power in leadership positions, ever-increasing demands for financial resources, inter-class cooperation figures, negative impact of the 24-hour working media, the fact that the most important elections for Congressmen are often for election and finally the silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the Congress is moving more to the Internet because of the pandemic, where such a system, which allows elections with the help of deputy representatives without the need for congressmen to travel to Washington, could add to the problems that exist.
If the idea of a remote conference gets established, it would be a serious setback for attempts to increase inter-class relations, as the report says.
“For reasons of the global epidemic, the Congress was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet and we certainly understand why, ” says the report.
“But despite the necessity, such things should not be interpreted as virtue.”
The document says that the Congress needs “more but not less interaction between Congressmen, face to face. ”
They need to study each other’s territory better, have polite conversations to find common ground, and build trust-based relationships that can lead to increased understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly relevant this week, when Ted Yoho, the Congressman of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Senator of the Democrats from New York by the incident and his associates in the Republican Party, to attack Liz Cheney, the Congressman of the Republic of Wyoming with hostile words.
Congresswoman Val Demings talks about the vice-presidentship, tells Trump before he gets in touch.
The Congressional Val Demings (Democrats, Florida) was not shy about discussing his interest in taking up Vice President’s office in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere gratitude for being taken into consideration for his office.
This esteemed member of the black group was interviewed by BlackPressUSA in a live broadcast on #FIYAH! of the live show and told about his story, his power and his commitment to the place she is at today, and began with the words “You know all my history. I grew up as a daughter of a maid and a housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida”.
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Senate in the Donald Trump trial in the January Senate.
Regardless of whether the Senate condemns Trump, it will be recorded in history that he is the fourth president to be accused.
In an interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, this former deputy prosecutor was quoted as saying: “Was this worth it?
She added that although the ruling had been disappointing, democrats were obliged to follow the case regardless of its outcome.
During the interview, Demings made it clear that she was opposed to Trump’s arrest of Roger Stone, who was sentenced to lie before the Congress (including other crimes) as well as his pardon for other criminals convicted of similar crimes, saying: “The indecency to reach your friends, those who have lied and cheated to cover up your iniquities. ”
Deamings is at the top of Joe Biden's list of potential proponents to Vice President Karen Bass, chairman of CBC (Democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former Senator of Georgia, Senators Kamälu Harris (Democrats, California), and Tammy Duckworth (Democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms, mayor of Atlanta, Susan Rice, former ambassador of the United States, and several others.
However, she noted that only one person would decide who would volunteer with Joe Biden in the fall.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she took her hand to her mouth while she laughed and pretended to whisper to those watching the live broadcast, adding, “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of political views, history books will look at this period as a time when developments in American politics and attitudes developed.
This didn't happen to Demings.
She pointed out that the number of women making representations to the vice president of the United States is an opportunity to break through what remains of the “glass roof ” — especially for African women.
“ It’s precisely this opportunity that I work so hard that my whole life to create for young boys and girls who have heard that their color is wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The Congresswoman resolved to ensure that the Democratic Party National Committee and the Biden electoral team would advertise and work with the Black Press of America to get as many people to vote and possibly vote.
"I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Party National Committee) and I will put this at the top of my list," promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the campaign.
When she replied to the words of former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost the election, and another editorial that says that the president is preparing to reach himself, lived over Demings: “To the extent that I suggest to reach myself made me feel unhappy. ”
“But who would ever do it other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break the law and ignore the constitution in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he hates losing.
I can absolutely believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our way to take care of it, and if that happens I will only be with those who let it happen."

Alibaba and Jack Ma are going to court in Gurugram because of the ex-worker's ex-worker's claim.
Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been brought to justice in Gurugram, after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been accused of objecting to editorials and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is addressed in the Gurugram District Court, and the private court judge Sonia Sheokand has published a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma, and over 10 others, asking them to appear on July 29, according to news.
According to Reuters, the judge has also requested written answers from the company.
Parmar, who served at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017, claims 268,000 U.S. dollars in damages according to court documents.
“We are committed to the company’s commitment to the Indian market and the well-being of its employees, and its direction is in line with current law.
We can't express ourselves about the current case," said UC India in a statement.
"The legal application also contains a 'list of sensitive words', which contains a password for Hindus and English such as the 'border of India and China' and the 'war between China and India', which is claimed in the claim that the UC Web uses to document the contents of its systems in India," says Reuters.
Last month, the Ministry of the Interior banned 59 Chinese mobile phone programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
A New York City firefighter's representative says that it's "completely" okay to exclude a white fireman from a medallion
A representative who deals with issues of diversity at New York City fire brigade says it is 'completely' okay to keep a white fire brigade from a scout so that flag bearers can all be black, according to a new story.
White firefighter Daniel McWilliams has brought up the issue of racial discrimination after he was removed from the flag bearer group at a memorial in November 2017 to commemorate the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a black firefighter’s brotherhood.
The chief fireman in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, was also defending the decision in the New York Post Human Rights Division.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters in the unit who, in a historical form, are shown to lift the American flag at Ground Zero on the day after the September 11 attacks.
According to McWilliam’s charge, the fire department had chosen him to be alone to the flag bears at the memorial ceremony.
Being a flagbearer at this ceremony was a “great honor and privilege” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN case law.
When he arrived at the ceremony, however, he was prevented from participating in the honorary service by the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for it was claimed that all flag bearers at the Mass would be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29-year-old New York City firefighter, to help in another way."
Among the claims that she had asked him to do so is to accompany civilians and to adjust the characteristics of the firefighters away from the Mass.
McWilliams asserted in his appeal that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the guard because he was not black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has served in New York City fire brigade for 21 years and who also participated in the rescue work on September 11, will have replaced McWilliams with one of the members of the Vulcan Society.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to spare himself further shame, humiliation and shame, ” when friends and associates heard what happened between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, who was black, testified in court to McWilliam’s attorney, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So praying that everyone is black in a medal is not a distinction? ”
"No, it isn't," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be all right to ask that everyone be black at a price that she answered, “Absolutely. ”
Promise explained that it would be okay to replace a white person with a black person in order to “have our speciality and different origins in order to create pride, harmony, and support for one another. ”
McWilliams first filed an action for racial discrimination against the New York City fire brigade in January 2018.
He then filed an action against Wilson, New York City fire department, New York City, and unidentified individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams filed his charges, Wilson’s supporters would have avenged him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put his hands on McWilliams and said: “I’ve heard about you, they told me you would behave like this, and now you know who I am. ”
In an exodus Sullivan wrote that excluding McWilliams from the honorary service at the Mass would have been "a tragedy" and evidence that one thing did not apply to everyone at the fire department.
“If you’re a black person and a white person’s differences at work, you’ll be reminded at most, ” said Sullivan.
Wilson received a "one-hour consultation" for her treatment of McWilliams.
Meanwhile, a white person who discriminates against a black person receives “a severe punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
"The fire department of New York City has created a policy and process to please members of the Vulcan community, who act in a racist way, excuse their actions and assist them ... and this must be stopped," Sullivan also wrote.
Threatened a walking roadfarer and demanded money
One was arrested in the city after attempted robbery, where he threatened a walking roadman and tried to get money from the person.
The man was saved in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the city center.
The knife was confiscated and reported by the person.
Over eighty cases were filed by the police in the capital area from 17 to 05 C.E., and six were stored in a prison cell this morning.
Among other things, police stopped the car driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi, where the trailer was in a very bad condition.
The trailer was stopped and the owner intended to provide transport equipment to move it into town.
Then the police stopped producing drugs in the City of Årby.
Two were arrested for the case and were released after reporting.
There was also an announcement of people who fired fireworks in the town of Årby.
They had escaped the scene when a police officer came to the scene “yet, they probably knew of the shame that is still going on for a long time. ”
Thousands of Khabarovsk’s inhabitants still demand the resignation of Putin
Thousands of the city's population were in charge of the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the district governor in the same region south of East Russia and the installation of his successors, who have never lived in the region.
The former governor, Sergei Furgal, enjoys great popularity, and tens of thousands of city dwellers protested when he was arrested and taken to Moscow for custody earlier this month, accused of having ordered the murder of three businessmen 15 years ago.
In a recent week, Furgal was formally appointed by a district governor and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, to replace him, with little likeness of the locals.
Degtaryev is said to be inexperienced and, worse still, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the inhabitants of the city after his declaration the fastest.
They've called Degtaryev. They've acted like the wind around their ears.
The protestors yesterday were little fewer than in the first Protestants, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: The liberation of Furgal and the resignation of Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
"We want the governor to be released, because we believe that his arrest is very likely to be illegal," said Alina Slepovu, the AFP newsroom.
She claims that the Kremlin agents had Furgal arrested “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the region. ”
A police officer in Khabarovsk left protestors unencumbered despite the clear violation of the current ban on the Korean virus epidemic.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met in Pushkin Square to show protestors in Khabarovsk support in action, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
Furgal's group, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, is a group of hard-line nationalists, and is considered by political commentators to be somewhat loyal to the Kremlin government in most cases.
The same political commentators, however, inform the BBC that Furgal’s victory in the district election two years ago — which was great and undisputed — was a considerable blow to Putin and the United Russia, and although there is evidence that Kremlar’s conquests in the eastern regions were weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he awaits trial.
He is accused of having ordered three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were dead, and the third perished.
Sarah Rainsford, correspondent of the BBC in Moscow, says that Furgal’s followers, who enjoy a great popularity at home, are convinced that the charges and arrests have political roots.
They want to know why the government has been waiting for him to be arrested until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his alleged crime.
Tree branches turned out when Hurricane Hanna rode over South Texas

Jorge Castillo shared this video on Twitter and told Storyful that he had taken it outside his home in Combes, Texas, on Sunday morning.
Homeless women with disabilities participate in the fight against COVID-19 in Chennai
Shanthi, a pregnant woman educated as a tailor, visits 250 homes every day to identify people with symptoms in Kodambakkam, a large Covid infected area in Chennai, where some 10,000 cases have been reported.
Workday starts early at 7:30, and ends at 4:30.
It measures the warmth of the population, asks about symptoms, and teaches them the importance of using masks, washing your hands regularly, and keeping others away.
In fact, her work has led to the detection and treatment of infections in four positive individuals.
Shanthi is one of 16,000 employees of Chennai City who care for the local skyscrapers but are not healthcare professionals.
According to the government, the project has contributed to a 50 - percent reduction in positive cases, in the daily Chennai count, while they are growing in other Tamil regions.
Shanthi says not all the residents are cooperative.
She adds: “Most people are cooperative when a woman with disabilities approaches them.
Some, however, get annoyed.
This, however, is not to worry about.
I think people should be able to be safe.
When I come back the next day, the people will be polite.
It helps to build a good relationship."
And there are more women like Shanthi who live in the city's gistyl for women with disabilities and fight the Covid-19 team.
Not far from Kodambakkam, Kavitha, who also has a disability, has also taken part in the campaign as an overseer.
Although Kavitha does not have a specially designed bike, she walks to meet people and holds on to her hags.
“I’m happy,” she says, “but adds: “I want to see them go down to maybe about 100 a day.
I'm sure we can get it."
On the first floor of the Gistonym where the two live are Matilda Funceca, the basketball team that uses a wheelchair, and the Manimekalai, a teacher, and they send all the data transmitted from about 40 women to the Chennai-city web-server.
Matilda does not claim to be afraid of being infected by the coronary virus.
“ When we help others, God protects us, ” she adds.
When asked what measures she is taking, Manimekalai says: “I use a mask, keep my distance, and wash my hands often.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sitzha-drink that boosts the immune system."
A few months ago, when the coronary virus first arrived in Chennai, these disabled women guarded their time and ability to sew masks for health - care professionals in the city.
Dr. Aishwarya Rao and the director of the Gistonym, as well as the Dorcas Research Center that runs the shelter, says: “They adapt to the needs of each moment.
In the past, masks were missing, and they did not leave their own.
Now it's time to intervene in society, and they answered the call."
Coronary virus infection in Tamil Nadu has now reached 200,000 after a new case of 6989 a day, but it is also the highest number of infections detected in one day, according to official data.
Eighty - nine have died, and 7758 have recovered within 24 hours.
The total number of infections in the country is now 206,737.
Police are trying to find out about the last journey of a teenager in Helensburgh
Investigators investigating the death of adolescence in Helensburgh are now trying to put together a timeline over his last journey.
The 19-year-old Kirk Allan's body was found in Johnson Court's home at 6:25 a.m. on Saturday.
A 30 - year - old man was arrested, and the police confirmed on Sunday that he had now been charged with death.
He'll be in court in Dumbarton on Monday.
Police chief Steve Martin said: “Our minds are with the family and friends of Kirk in these difficult times.
Policemen will continue to work with the community and provide support.
Our research continues to focus on getting a full picture of what happened, especially the last days of Kirk's journey before his death, but we're not looking for anyone else in connection with death."
South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox report their experience of discrimination
In the last few weeks, it has been found that many skeletons are still in the closet in connection with racial discrimination in sports in South Africa.
For all to be welcomed in sports, upbuilding conversations must take place and take action.
Ashwell Prince, a former Proteas cricket star, made known to his former white associates and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other blacks were “guitar players. ”
Prince said that Proteas’ black players have been officially named “guitar players ” by their white associates.
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada reached the top of the game, some people still linked them to the quota discussion.
Prince, now coach of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organizations (UCSCBO) web meeting on Thursday night.
The purpose of the organization is to continue the heated discussion of historical racial rights in South Africa’s sports.
“As I said when I lightened on social media, it’s not my intention to come and drag people’s names down to the area, but these are real incidents...
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected."
Paul Roberts, a former musician and builder who became a NASA developer, now works at a software company.
He and his wife, an ex-sister at Methodist Hospital, who sees himself as an optimist, held out an amateur magazine online and attended a Comic Con event earlier in the year.
Once a week, they're playing with two of their daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old grandchild and playing intense Uno games.
"They're amazing nerds," says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years old, is aware of the dangers of the pandemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that can put her at increased risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and an arm that has a previously blocked coronary artery open.
"We've been so careful, very careful, and kept us away from people," said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working from home in the spring, when the epidemic fought hard in the Washington, New York, and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone into the “old age ” market, and the only real date of their last month was Sheryl when they started looking at wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter also took care.
But then she came home snarling from work one day in the middle of June and thought she was allergic.
Soon she got cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all sense of taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the coronary virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I was wearing a mask, I had gloves, I washed my hands,” Sheryl said.
"You're doing everything right, but you're getting infected."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with positive coronal virus infection, did not become seriously ill.
However, the situation became much worse for her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began sneezing and then coughing, just like their daughter, and then got a fever and a lot of pain in the body.
Then, sheryl Roberts said, he became “very sick, very quickly. ”
On June 22, he became confused.
She worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency room for the second time in two days.

The couple’s new life story, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were overlooked in the collection that could be seen in the Christmas celebration.
Pictures on the desk the queen sat on showed include the William of Britain, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprins, and his wife Kamilla, as well as Prince Philip.
However, despite Archie’s birth in May, Meghan and Harry were nowhere to be seen, but the boy was mentioned as the “eighty granddaughter ” of her Majesty.
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton “were never friends, ” since they“ found it difficult to overcome superficial courtesy ” and met only a few times.
Yesterday, it was claimed that Harry and William’s brother had begun some years before his relationship with Meghan began, but this reached a climax because of William’s marriage with Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “warning ” of events with his brother and Kate Middleton, claiming that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came into existence. ”
Congressmen of the Congress accuse labor leaders of wanting to keep public employees “world forever. ”
Congressmen of the Congress accused labour leaders of wanting public workers to be “world forever, ” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work
Prosecution officers were accused of wanting workers to “be at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call to people to return to work.
Congressmen of the Reformation were angry when the public and public workers’ unions told their fellow workers to kick their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their places of work.
Andrew Percy, former minister, said that the necessary public service, such as the publication of passports, was “unacceptable” while public service personnel in the general market had worked hard to keep the community going in the chronic viral epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their jobs while workers in warehouses and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that public employees can eat during this period, ” he said.
“ Many of these workers now want to go on a summer vacation but cannot do so because of the people who refuse to go back to their places of work, even if it is safe.
Prefects cannot maintain this policy of living at home forever, especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
Following a call from the Prime Minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed head of public service, announced that the council was to “disappear from working at home in public service and to speed up their return to their places of employment until August 1. ”
The public - general and public - service association expressed to its associates, who account for some 200,000 people, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, and that this was about politics.
A spokesman for the Public and Public Workers’ Association, the largest public employment organization in Britain, said that the requirement to return to work “was not put forward with the health and safety of our social partners in the first place, nor to strengthen the economy.
This is a one - way process because of political pressure from Congressmen who demand that public service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our advice to fellow workers is clear: If you do your job at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to work, don't take what you need to do."
The issue is a growing dissatisfaction with a delayed version of passports because employees work at home, but some 400,000 people are now said to be waiting for their applications to be processed.
The Ministry of the Interior has now published that it will “seek to speed up” UK applications for travel over the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport issue for more than four weeks.
Public and public - service employment has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days for passports, but they claim that “small and often narrow offices ” make it difficult for 4,000 people in the passport service to keep the necessary distance.
The former minister of the government, David Davis, urged the leaders of labor unions to “be reasonable ” and to seek out ways to get people back into their places of work.
He added that if he was in government, he would ask a labor officer: “What do you want, that people stay home all summer? ”
However, several of Britain’s largest companies have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to people to return to work.
A study of larger workplaces with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their places of work.
The emphasis on history can play an important role in reconciliation
The giraffe has widened, but understanding and reconciliation should be the goal.
The school system is partly to blame for this lack of knowledge and understanding.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is, without radical action, the only discipline that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia ” for the 12th grade — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Victorian Kingdom completed a total of 49,324 students in Australia’s history, or just 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost halved, but nearly 100 fewer students enter the trade each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th - grade history is that little has been done in previous years to arouse their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but it falls under the broader “science. ”
Therefore, 7th and 8th grade students will complete only one brief unit on the "Early and Essential Beards of Torres and their culture".
During World Wars, during the 9th and 10th years, there is another unity about Australia.
For many students in Victoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during the early years of high school.
During the 9th and 10th years, there is another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history in Victorian schools.
First, history must become an independent study article, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is felt only as part of the mind, it is given little space in the study file.
It is usually taught by people who have a general education in the field of thought but who have not been educated in history.
Historical skills, such as the analysis of information, are complex.
To ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way, we need to employ more specialised historians.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 will become a field of responsibility.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, for they would have had to learn the material from scratch.
Knowledge of history alone does not bridge deep gaps between races.
But without it, as can be clearly seen in the Victorian curriculum, the project is hopeless.

Aron Elis in a European Seat - Ice cream game divided from field to half game
Aron Elís Trändarson is in the Danish football championship for European seats.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only the first half with the top team Norrköping against Falkenberg, Sweden.
Aron Elís was a team member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play the premise of the European Union.
OB will meet with AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the teams end up after the final round of the top Danish prime department later today.
Aron Elís played the entire game at Horsens 1-1 in a field today, but OB had won the first game at home, 3-1 in a row, and thus won a total of 4-2 in a row.
Isaac was in the early team of Norrköping, who was unexpectedly 2-0 below the previous half-game against Falkenberg's bottom team in the Swedish prime.
At the beginning of the second half, Norrköping was one of those who had to depart.
Norrköping achieved a level playing field, but Falkenberg reached 3–2 in 89 minutes.
Still, it was time for Norrköping to get out of hell at the last moment, 3-4–3.
Norrköping continues at the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfsborg, and five points ahead of Malmö, which is playing for good later today.
Falkenberg was able to escape the bottom for a while, but there is a ladder above Helsingborg and Kalmar who have a good game.
Collectes Rifts of the Chronovirus Times
Anna Lilja, daughter of Victory, founded the Facebook group “My International Festival 2020 ” to collect sources of the next weekend’s celebration of the islanders.
Many will camp in their gardens and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja spoke to Hurl, on the weekend of the Wave.
“ Nothing has come in yet that is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group, so they’re obviously going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
There's something about the islanders having tent parties at home in the garden.
“ People have spoken of being with their own [festivities], perhaps camping in the garden, and laughing at the family as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“You expect people to spend time with their people.
However, it is likely that many will not be there “but still hold some small national festival somewhere else. ”
The International Festival Committee is now working hard to repay the tickets purchased, but Anna believes that many locals are more likely to secure tickets for the next year’s festival.
"People are even investing in the tickets now and making a difference by 2021."
“I’m a great National Celebrating Man, I love the preparation and everything around it, but sometimes something comes into your life that you can’t control any way, and it’s just like that,” says Anna, but according to a story, people wonder if the Eyes can’t let go of the National Festival once.
Anna Lilja claims that she did not set up the group for herself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival but to collect records of the Ecclesiastical Holidays in the Islands this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then there's somebody who uses this kind of authority in something, but I was just creating some area where people can put in what they're doing."
At the same time, a fire has been recharged on the Lighthouse, which is set on every year.
“ I think a lot of people are excited about having a burning Friday night.
The only thing that makes a line in the account, of course, is that the prophecy is nothing special."
“ It’s going to be set on fire, but it just has to show what it’s going to be like, ” says Anna Lilja.

Is Prince Andrew mentioned in a new paper on sexual immorality?
The British royal family is now preparing to respond to possible new information in court documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Amongst these 80 pages of documents are parts with Maxwell’s 2016 testimony
The display of these pages could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew as they communicate between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced U.S. financier, asserted in court documents that she had been forced to communicate with Prince Andrew.
Prince Andrew is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information this week with even more damaging accusations of his friendship with child abuser Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged companion, Ghislaine Maxwell.
This week, U.S. district judge Loretta Preska ordered the publication of 80 classified legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, counting hundreds of pages.
The presentation of these vast documents would be a shock to the 58 - year - old Maxwell, who have much of her testimony in front of lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said were “rapid questions ” about her sex story.
They could also put a great deal of pressure on Prince Andrew, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the alleged sex slave of the disgraced American financial officer, asserted in 2015 in court documents that she had been forced three times to have relations with Andrew.
Andrew has repeatedly and unequivocally rejected these claims.
An electronic mail from 2015 that has been leaked and the BBC released last year appears to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell for assistance in responding to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will have an insurrection
There he said to the superintendent: “Let me know when we can talk, and there are certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “I have information, so call me when you have an hour off. ”
Last night, a source standing close to Andrew said: “The Duke of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about opening a court case.
As the U.S. courts have tried to point out, this does not mean that an accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
The U.S. courts have urged the media and the public to take full care to deal with the allegations made in court documents.
We totally agree with that.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be fully honoured in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in detention at a detention centre in Manhattan, waiting for trial to find and seduce some of Epstein’s victims who were under legal age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of defamation for refusing to report on his abuse.
She rejects all charges.
Maxwell last spoke to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Roberts' claims, who is now under the last name of Giuffre, which she picked up after her marriage.
Some 40 pages of 418 of this testimony were made public last year, but after the ruling of Judge Presna in New York last week, more parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Lawyers Maxwell received one week to file an appeal.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was being tried for sexual abuse.
Detectives are looking for a gang of crime for a violent attack on the streets of Edinburgh.
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him injuries that could prove permanent.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 a.m. on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injuries.
Investigator Dale Miles, who conducts the study, said: “This was a violent and unrelenting attack. ”
Suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was thought to be in its 40 ’ s, about a hundred inches [180 cm] tall, and strongly grown.
He was short - cut and dark - haired in white shirts, dark trousers, and dark shoes.
One researcher named Miles said: “I pray to everyone who was in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious of giving up. ”
The ambassador wants to carry a gun in Iceland.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador to Iceland, wants to carry a gun on land and wants to increase security.
He was said to have been “weaned ” about his safety since he came to the country last year.
This is stated in the CBS report, which also says that although Gunter is “one of the safest states in the world, ” he wants to do so.
Gunter is said to have asked the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs to hide from the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for an armored car and vest to protect him against knife tongues.
CBS sources say the government has repeatedly announced to Gunter that it is not at risk in Iceland.
According to CBS, Iceland’s State Department has not provided information on whether a request for Gunter’s possible armaments was received from the United States, because the authorities do not express themselves on the security measures taken by foreign traders.
Even though no request was made, the news agency’s sources say that there was no request.
Then CBS has it, too, after his sources were told that Gunter should not seek to carry weapons, for that would be taken as an insult here in the country.
Gunter has been a skin disease doctor in California for some years.
He is active in the Republican Party of the United States, and a zealous supporter of President Donald Trump.
He recently called attention to the land when he peed on “the invisible Chinese virus. ”
CBS sources also say that Gunter’s attitude toward the United States embassy in Reykjavik was greatly affected.
He had already had seven second - second employees in the May embassy last year.
Among other things, he has accused them of belonging to the so - called “Deep Kingdom, ” a network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and he was angry that one carried snow into his office.
The ambassador traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for several months, according to CBS sources.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but eventually Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The home form is a key element for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has an easier game to play when fans get to come back to play
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game in a home field since the original department started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good walk at home if the audience were allowed to play.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this season, but he lost four times — only one of the six teams that are above them has lost more at home.
The coach said that although such a victory would be possible without its adherents, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them you can build some kind of work, where the game plan is in the foreground,” he said.
“But I think it would be much more powerful to do it with the fans, because they add to the emotional side of the game, which only comes next with the help of fans at home. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the long victory periods at home that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built up over the last three seasons.
However, these are also key elements in determining whether the end of the period will achieve its goals, especially in equal games and neighboring laws, where the atmosphere in the field can change.
“I believe that the policy in the elite department is that now it is becoming increasingly difficult to beat this unfavorable record, because the past has become good.”
"The important thing is to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, to have won a number of points in home games."
“I’m happy with the finals from home games recently, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I imagine a victory against Arsenal with the field full of Tottenham fans.
This is compassion, which is gradually built up."
The buyers are excited about the wanted lifestyle properties in Lovely Banks
“Bigger is better” is clearly the motto of new owners of huge properties in the Lovely Banks neighborhood, which was recently sold at $1,270 in Australia.
Interesting buyers in search of life-style property near the centre of Geelong were moved to visit this 1.35 hectares of land, where a car shelter can be found for 14 cars, a swimming pool and views of the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate agent in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer on the property said that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of being placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove again for sale
Home Ideal for Isolation
"We got a lot of offers from various parties," said Grgic.
"The property was sold to a very excited local."
The property is housed in four rooms on two levels, including a separate bathroom large enough to sleep.
The new owners have a choice of three living rooms, and they can make use of the kitchen and upgrade the outdoor area with a view over the pool.
"It was because of the composition of the property, that it was three acres, and that it was in this place," said Grgic.
“ Interesting buyers from Melbourne came here, wondering what the property was, but still with a farm.
“I have people who have missed and buyers who are still looking.”
He said that the spacious storage area, which includes a double garage and a shelter that covers 10-12 vehicles, was perfect for industrialists or for the storage of bicycles and aftercars.
Counts its security threatened in Iceland
“Despite being appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been paranoid about his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year.”
This is how CBS News' extensive coverage of the U.S. ambassadors in Iceland begins, but this simulates numerous sources of CBS from the U.S. foreign service.
CBS reported that Gunter had requested that the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs provide him with a special permission from the Icelandic government to carry firearms.
Then, too, he should have wished for an armored car, as well as for ideas about a vest that could defend him from a knife - tongue attack.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs refused to state publicly whether Gunter’s security is a real threat in Iceland, but according to information from officials, Gunter has repeatedly been expressed that he is in no particular danger.
In spite of this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced a full - time mission, including in the morning of July 18th, but CBS reports that it is done to ease Gunter’s concerns.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express itself about the current security measures associated with its embassy, but it always states its goal of ensuring security in a preventive manner.
The government does not answer questions related to Gunter’s wish to arm themselves and the Icelandic State Department does not want to say whether the United States has formally requested that the ambassador carry firearms, and usually does not express itself on foreign security issues.
According to his Icelandic sources, CBS, however, has never requested such a request, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was taken from these plans as they could lead to insulting the locals in Iceland.
CBS is also discussing the various problems that have been affecting the U.S. embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have replaced his deputy seven times.
Thus, the first viceroy is said to have prepared for his work for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position at the last moment because Gunter “does not read him” at their first meeting.
His successors have not gone much better under Gunter’s rule.
The United States Department of Foreign Affairs officials are told that they are aware of the position of the embassy in Iceland, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters that are closely related to the President.
In addition, Gunter is said to be reluctant to follow the different rules of foreign service and respect the chain of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a convention in Washington, and it is said that he refused to return to Iceland and let his temporary substitute do his work for months, and that in the middle of a pandemic.
Will Gunter have even wished to do his job in the distance and said he would not return to Iceland unless the Foreign Minister himself, Mike Pompeo, specifically wished for it.
According to information provided by the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take personal leave of the conference and the Crown Virus Epidemic delayed his journey even further, but according to CBS records, many inside the government have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he has not done so until May, after Pompeo contacted him and kindly asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS report also reports Gunter’s intrusion in Iceland, particularly in connection with the tick, where he calls the coronary virus “the invisible Chinese virus” and has been highly critical of it.
Gunter is one of many, almost inexperienced in the field of the foreign service of an ambassador appointed during the reign of Donald Trump, president of the United States.
Sachin Pilot v. Ashok Gelot; Bharatiya Janata Group says government crisis in the state; Congress Party wants vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if necessary, the Congress would have to attend a session of protests outside the prime minister’s home.
On Saturday, the day after peaceful protests against Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, the prime minister of Rajasthan, said that if necessary, Congressmen would have to meet the president and the material for protests outside the Prime Minister’s home to bring the crisis to an end.
At the Congressional meeting, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to pay a vote to check whether the majority of the members of the Congress and their associates were with him in the power struggle.
“He told the government that he had the majority and wanted to vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the main party guard of the Congress Party, after the meeting.
The convention was held in a hotel, where the delegates supporting Gehlot have stayed in the last days.
“ The prime minister asked us to be ready to stay longer at the hotel.
If necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the Prime Minister's home," said a party leader.
The Prime Minister of Rajasthan can convene the Congress and let the Congress Party demonstrate its majority, said the leader of the party Rahul Gandhi on Friday, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Party had come up with a plan to overthrow Ashok Gehlot's government.
“The country is now governed by law and constitution.
Governments are formed and act with the authority of the people.
Bharatiya Janata's plot to overthrow Rajasthan's government has come to light.
This is an insult to the 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must convene the Congress to bring the truth before the land," said Gandhi in Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, prime minister of Rajasthan, told the Congressional on Saturday that he was prepared to attend a meeting of the Presidents of India to ensure that what he calls “the adviser of Bharatiya Janata” to delay a vote of vote on a declaration of confidence will not succeed.
Gelot, who protested for hours at the home of the governor of Kalraj Mishra on Friday to press for a congress, met with Congressmen and government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and approved by government.
Last night, Mishra asked Gehlot to file the motion for a meeting again and referred to six objections.
The initiative will soon be sent to the Governor.
Geckot has accused the governor of delaying the Congress meeting, where he is “under pressure” to delay the vote payment that determines his confidence in his government.
When Gelot met his government, he met Bharatiya Janata, head of the satish poonia leadership, and head of government, Gulab Chandra Kataria, with the governor, to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the state.

The playwreck Spencer Grammer, a ditch outside the Manhattan restaurant.
NEW YORK – The playwright Spencer Grammar said he was trying to calm an angry man when he cut her arm and stuck her friend in the back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, 36 years old, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation that they had been trying to prevent things from getting worse when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the surface of The Black Ant in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan at 11:30 p.m.
On the Friday, when a man came up to them, and demanded payment, he was shutting down the restaurant.
Grammer and her friend were injured when they tried to “solve differences between an unknown man and other guests in the place, ” according to the police.
The man ran off after hurting Grammer’s right arm and stabbing her friend in the back with an unknown tip, said the police.
No one's been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the series 'Rick and Morty' and previously played in the series 'Greek' on ABC Family, is the daughter of the Frasier star Kelsey Grammer and actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to recover quickly.
Neither of them suffered serious internal injuries, she said.
In a statement to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded at the scene and the Bellevue Hospital staff who looked after them and mentioned the “unbelievable struggle” of these staff against the coronary virus epidemic.
"It really touched us to have a chance to thank them in person," said Grammer.
“I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic night at UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The fighter Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now named as the next star of the UFC after enrolling in the history of Fight Island, but he says he does not aim to flag his wealth in a ridiculous way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the Northern Irish Rhys McKee in their battles in a roll-out in Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he won his competition when three minutes and nine seconds of the first round were over by knocking him on the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in the history books of the UFC for the shortest time between victories in the modern history of the race, when only 10 days had passed since he conquered the British John Phillips in a similar way, then in between.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, received a 50,000 U.S. dollar bonus for the performance of the evening against McKee and has captured the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called "Khalib 2.0", which can be said to be inescapable comparison because of the odds between the superiority of Chimaev and the UFC champion in light weight and where he is born in Chechnya, which is close to local Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newfound fame and financial gain, the vernacular Chimaev has said that he would not be happy to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his peer in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“I don’t just do this for myself, I do this for everyone I can help.
“I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked at Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, noticed the teammate Conor McGregor and the Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social media that he could "easy" defeat Chimaev with a delivery device.
It did not contain a poisonous answer from the fighter named “Borz, ” or“ wolf, ” in his native Teten language, who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who now lives in Stockholm, Sweden, after moving to the country at the age of 19, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is clearly indifferent to his fighting skills.
“I can grind anyone...
How many fighters are in the Pedestrian Division?
"I can grind them all," he said.
“Give me 75 pounds [77 kg] of masters, 80 pounds [84 kg] of masters, and I will grind them both, that same day.”
Israel continues to protest the Prime Minister’s reaction to the pandemic
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the prime minister of the land on Saturday and were the largest protests except for the official residence of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have lasted for a few weeks, but they began because critics believe that the failure of the government should respond to the coronary virus epidemic after initially being able to control the threat of the virus.
Prosecution of Netanyahu for corruption has further promoted protests.
"Bibi, go home," stood on the sign of one of the Protestants.
The second card stated: “Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside Netanyahu beachhouse in the wealthy city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to scatter groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called the rapid and unorganized reopening of the economy in May, the average number of new cases per day increased to 2000.
The economic situation in the country has been affected by the limitations of the virus, and unemployment has increased by nearly 20%.
Adversaries say that the government’s financial support is in no way sufficient.
The protests took place in the shadow of legal proceedings against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Hearings begin in January.
He is accused of betrayal, betrayal, and bribery in a row of scandals.
Hundreds of Protestants meet in central Los Angeles to show agreement with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – About 300 protesters met in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two-month-old movements in Portland, Oregon, focusing on FBI after protesters.
Similar Protestant meetings took place throughout the United States, including Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front groups.
The group moved to the headquarters of the Los Angeles police station on First Street and Main Street and then to the main - city detention centre.
The participants also moved to the Alameda River on Route 101, but later abandoned it.
Part of the people were seen breaking windows in central federal buildings, and filth was written on federal marks.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 Moscows in the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the Karnataka government
The feast of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, is on July 31st and August 1st.
The Karnataka authorities have issued that only 50 may congregate in mosques to pray for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer gatherings in Eidgah and other places because of the coronary virus epidemic.
Guests who want to pray in mosques must wear masks and keep away, as instructed by AB Ibrahim, the government director of minority groups and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee has decided that the Eid-ul-Azha celebration, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the Udupi, Dakhina Kannada and Kodagu regions, but on 1 August elsewhere in the State.
The order states that while prayer meetings are one of the most important rituals of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events will be banned in Eidgah and other places because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
Prayers are, however, allowed in mosques, given that no more than 50 are involved at one time.
If more than that is required for prayer, the agency states in the directive.
There is no need for prayer meetings elsewhere, such as meeting houses, social centers, or “Shadi Mahal, ” to be held.
The Karnaka authorities allow the opening of temples, mosques and other places of worship to those who wish to pray from 8 June, giving due consideration to the protection of COVID-19.
The U.S. ambassador wants an armed bodyguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. ambassador to Iceland, believes that his life is threatened here and wants to walk with weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. Embassy repeatedly advertised the lifeguard “bodyguard” in Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kveik’s sources, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that the ambassador Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes his life is threatened in Iceland.
There has been a discussion of sources in Iceland and abroad who have convinced the ambassador that he is in great danger and why he is of Jewish descent.
What is the threat? It is not as clear, but the interviewers of Kseuk said that the Islamic terrorists had been called a threat.
The CBS television station discussed the issue on its website this morning, and according to the Washington authorities, Gunter is paranoid, insists on carrying weapons himself, getting a punctured vest, and armed escorts as well as a bulletproof car.
According to CBS sources, Gunter has been repeatedly said that there is no threat and that the advertisement after 'bodyguard' is only to sleep Gunter.
According to Kveik’s sources, the positions had not been taken at the end of June, but the application deadline expired in February.
According to Kveik’s sources, these changes have not resulted in a formal message from the U.S. embassy.
No formal request has been made for increased custody or for permission for bodyguards to march outside the walls of the embassy.
Icelandic law determines that this is not permitted except by a special authority of the State Marshal.
There is no information available on any kind of threat to the members of the board of directors.
The newest threat assessment by the Governor of the State is somewhat decisive in the matter of terrorism.
There is no evidence of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence of terrorist or extreme groups working here.
The conditions under which the armed forces of foreign embassies on the streets of cities and villages in Iceland are allowed are not available, according to the source of the fire.
Gunter drew considerable attention here on the land when he shared with the president of the United States and called the COVID-19 "China Virus".
With the tide, he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A radioman in Seattle who mocked Trump’s reaction to protests now claims to have a gun after the Starbucks coffeehouse below his apartment was destroyed — RT USA News
Paul Gallant has had a new perspective on violent protests after he mocked President Donald Trump of the United States in June for saying that anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.
The only thing that needed to be heard was that the director’s home was nearer.
“I feel like I have to buy a gun because this will obviously continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday night after he saw that the destroyers had “destructed” the Starbucks coffeehouse on the lower floor of his apartment house.
"It looks like a street party down the street from me. Very angry now."
The contrast was quite different when Trump complained last month that the mayor of Seattle was allowing violent Protestants to take over the city.
"These liberal Democrats are hopeless," said the President.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just think it’s wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, co-director of the dance & gallant co-director at ESPN Collaborative Radio Station in Seattle, replied with a whim: “Go through the news last night and see neither burn nor rob nor die.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the residents to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks coffeehouse.
He published pictures of the damage and said, “Well done, you idiots, ” and stated that he had also seen fire a few blocks away.
"I don't know what's going on, but we're gonna find out."
The twist did not go past people who ridiculed Gallant for his previous opinion and chirped messages such as “Just relax on salmon,” and“Yah, maybe Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, second radioman in Seattle, said: “I guess we’re not finally going on this tour we talked about. ”
Gallant laughed: “Awake and saw that a lot of people were squeaking at me “sleep on a salmon. ”
He said he stood by his previous claim that he had walked through the Chaz self-government area of Anarkista and even though it was not as bad as it had been agreed.
"So it was burned and robbed after all," he said. "Predominantly."
White Lines star Laura Haddock, 34 years old, in an apartment search with his 28-year-old lover, Tom Rhys Harries
Laura Haddock and her boyfriend, Tom Rhys Harries, met at the scene of the White Lines, which deals with the swallowing and swallowing of Ibiza, but in a search of accommodations last week their appearance was another and calmer, far away from the pleasure of the party island.
The couple, who play the siblings in the Netflix series popular, were seen looking at a magnificent farm in Oxfordshire, which is available for sale at 1.2 million pounds.
They came to the area in Range Rover, which Laura, 34, drove, clothed in jeans and a white shirt, and met a real estate store there, which led them on a tour of five rooms of the house.
In White Lines, which was recorded last fall, Laura played the role of Zoe Walker, who becomes acquainted with the darker side of Ibiza when she investigates the murder of her brother, Alex, who is played by Tom, 28 years old.
Their relationship did not come to light until this month, less than a year from the end of the six - year marriage of Laura and Sam Claflin, known as the Hunger Games.
Together, the four - year - old son Pip and the daughter Margot, who are two years old, have two children.
When they reported on the divorce in August last year, Claflin, 34, wrote on Instagram: “I have decided to understand Laura’s divorce; we understand in love, friendship, and with deep respect for each other; and we will continue our cooperation in the training of our children.
Laura and Sam first met in an audition in 2011, and Sam, who has also played in Peaky Blinders, described their wedding in 2013 as “by no means one of the greatest achievements of my life. ”
Before Laura got her role in the White Lines, she had played in the first Inbetweeners movie, and in the crime drama The Capture from the BBC, which was shown last year, where she played the lawyer Hannah Roberts.
Tom played a role in the second Inbetweeners movie and in the series Brittania from Sky.
Counts too early to claim another wave here on land
An expert in the field of disease prevention at the National Institute of Medicine says too early to claim another wave of the epidemic.
Three new domestic infections were detected in the National Hospital virology unit yesterday and tens of people are infected.
Two domestic infections were detected on Thursday, one in a male in his 30 ’ s, and the other in a male in his 20 ’ s.
At that time, no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Last night, three more domestic infections were detected, one of which had been at the Rey Cup soccer tournament in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a newsroom, Chief Inspector John K. Jonsson, said that the number of people who were infected had to be less than that originally thought.
Another infection occurs in a person who came to the country from abroad on July 15.
At that time, a so - called home - call portal had passed.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease prevention at the National Medical Office, says that the individual, on the other hand, followed the old course.
His vision was negative at the time of his arrival in the land, but he became ill when he was isolated and six were put in sick.
They're all on their way to the show, but two of them are starting to show signs.
The third infection then involves the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and who has been infected with it.
It has been found that there is a new variant of the coronal virus that has not previously been detected on land.
“We don’t know exactly where this type of virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
Whoever is believed to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It believes too early to claim that the so - called other wave of the epidemic has begun here on land, just as other countries in Europe are afraid.
“While the majority is still admissible, it is not tantalizing.
But we're on our toes and we're watching, thinking about ways to react if anything like that could happen."
Megan Fox expresses himself about the relationship
Megan Fox says he found his twin room in the machine Gun Kelly rapper.
“ As soon as I met him and looked into his eyes, I knew.
I am interested in constellations, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was involved," says Fox, 34 years old.
“A twin soul is when the soul has come to exist sufficiently in order to be able to divide into two different bodies at the same time,” Fox explained.
“So we are two halves of the same soul, I think.
I told him the minute we met.
I found it right away."
“ Once we had known him for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the constellations and asked him about his life.
I decided to go to the depths immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same line, but they got to know each other when they were taking a movie.
“ I was going to hang outside her trailer and hoped to see her.
She has the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen."
Only two months have passed since Fox divorced his husband to ten years of age, Brian Austin Green.
They have three sons together.
Kanye apologizes to Kim.
The American musician, the tiscobula, and the president’s promoter Kanye West have apologized to Kim Kardashian West for making a public statement about his family’s private affairs.
“I want to apologize to my wife, Kim, for discussing private matters publicly,” he wrote on a Twitter entry last night.
Although their relationship has been in a state of great disquiet, Kanye has recently gone extensively through social media and during a mass meeting held last Monday, he discussed among other things the birth of his daughter North West and said that he had almost killed her.
Then, on Wednesday, Kim stepped up and published a message to her followers on Instagram, where she discussed her husband’s illness, which is diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Kardashian West has not previously made public statements about his husband’s illness, saying that it is because of their children and Kanye’s right to privacy when he comes to his health.

Increased weight in protests against racial rights in the United States
Protestants have walked the streets of many cities in the United States to draw attention to racial rights.
Objections have lasted for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died in Minnesota police station.
The Trump government has sent federal agents to Portland, and thus fueled the protests.
Objectors now also oppose the presence of the FBI in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, police used bombs and teargas and arrested 45 people, following protests to support the protests in Portland.
According to the police, over 20 police officers were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was launched into the Black Lives Matter program.
Media reports say that the man may have walked up to a car - armed rifle before he was shot.
“The point is that it’s scary for someone to die in protests,” said Steve Adler, Mayor Austin, declared.
Adler said that he was “tortured and speechless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed protesters demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with permission to enter without knocking, and shot her.
Taylor’s boyfriend had first shot at the police, thinking that they were burglars.
One police officer has been expelled for Taylor’s death, but the other officers have not been charged.
The leadership of the NFAC group, the armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in a police investigation into Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when a gun accidentally hit the rebel force.
Potential group infection
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside border surveillance.
Two of them were diagnosed with previously unseen variants of the virus, and three of the five infections appear to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a repatriated tourist or by an asymptomatic Icelander, who is likely to have infected many more.
According to a health care specialist, possible group infection may be associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country on the last Thursday, with each type of virus.
The origin of the contaminants is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by another of those diagnosed on Thursday, the other came to the land on July 15, and probably became infected outside, but the third is also infected from a vague source.
After sequencing in the Icelandic gene analysis, it was found that the two individuals diagnosed with the virus and associated with the new variant of the virus that has not previously been detected in this country.
Kamilla Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease prevention at Land doctor’s and a surrogate physician, says that an Icelandic genetic analysis is now examining which type of virus is most likely to come.
“The other case was similar to the one in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the odds to what part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
"But it seems to be right here on the side of the Atlantic."
Hence, the two that came up at the beginning of July and were raked to the United States.
Do you assume that this new species has come from outside rather than that it has changed domestically?
“Yes, it’s different from what has been found here before that there’s really no chance that this was something going on here,” says Kamilla.
“The odds are that these individuals have somehow come to the attention of a newly arrived person from somewhere outside, without knowing it for themselves.”
As yet, she says that there is no indication of where this new virus could have come from.
“ Of course, it could be a tourist who has left the country again, but it could also be someone who does not get symptoms and who does not realize that he has been infected, and then, of course, more infections could follow.
We'll be on our toes the next few days to keep an eye on it."
“Even now, there is no such thing as a smart group infection.
But there are individuals who have contracted disease in connection with one of yesterday's infections, who have symptoms and have already taken samples," continues Kamilla.
“We haven’t made any results yet.
So this could possibly be a group infection in the seal."
Do you now expect social contamination to occur?
“ It’s not impossible.
It has not been recently but it is not impossible because we do not know who has carried this infection in these individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday and on the other hand yesterday."
Could it be said that there is now a new wave of the virus?
“No, not yet.
Of course, we need to be very alert, and we need to keep that in mind, though, there are so many limitations to how much we can take in people’s eyes.
We don't take samples from asymptomatic people, but first that we're getting infections that seem undetectable, we need to be given a little more freer hands by taking samples from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it can be expected that the Department of Disease and Virology will be involved in the screenings in the next few days to try to better map the situation here domestically.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase domestic screening and to manage border screening?
“Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there needs to be some basis for samples to be taken in individuals who are not in the screening work; the person must be sick and show signs or symptoms or have had symptoms and suspect that someone who has just arrived in the country or something like that,' says Kamilla.
It points out that the infections identified yesterday are still being infected and that there is now much work to be done to obtain information about the individual’s journeys.
It says that the origin of domestic infections seems undetectable, but it does not rule out that some of those who have now been infected can provide evidence that will eventually lead the contagion team to the original infections.
The place where most people don't know but they think one is the best.
Not everyone knows where the restaurant Bjargarsteinn is located, and it probably has more fans from abroad than in this country if you can see the comment about it on TripAdvisor and other pages.
He has heard of people who have flown across the country to visit him with no wonder.
Mountain fountain Daughters, food blogger and cookbook writer, turned to Bjargarstein in the daytime and kept water of interest
“ I don’t know where to start, so the Björgarstein restaurant on the Grundarvärde is a wonderful place.
The history of the house is one of the most adorable things I know, the food of ten, the view not of the worse end, and the wonderfully pleasant servants!" says Bergspring.
“ Gunni, the owner of Bjargstein, enchanted each one of his precious rights in front of us.
My wife and I sat down with our girls for an entire evening, so it must have told us how good the food was," adds Bergspring.
“The house in which the restaurant is run is an old apartment house that was moved whole on Grundarfjörd.
Present owners threw their eyes into this house for sale in Akranes, found a beautiful seabed at Grundarförder, and made the dream come true.
You can read more about the history of the house on the Bjargarstein website."
“ Houses and all the surroundings of the Rock are unique.
A collection of differences from all over the family has been made, and it certainly has its taste in the home.
On the upper floor there is a sitting room and really kozy and homely to enter this wonderful restaurant.
The quality and cooking then do not hide themselves, and it is evident that much is done in the production of tasteful and beautiful food," says Bergspring, saying and bearing in mind that the pictures are not a lie.

Mick Fleetwood praises Peter Green: "His music will live"
Mick Fleetwood praised Peter Green, a cofounder of Fleetwood Mac, who died today at the age of 73.
Green was a founding member of this historic rock band, along with the former Mick and Jeremy Spencer.
Although Green left the band in 1970, before she reached her peaks with records such as Rumours, Mick has praised this former band member and assured fans that “his music will live on. ”
"For me and all the former and present members of Fleetwood Mac, losing Peter Green a great memory time," said Fleetwood in a conversation with PA.
“Peter was the man who founded the Fleetwood Mac band together with me, John McVie and Jeremy Spencer.
No one has ever joined Fleetwood Mac without having deep respect for Peter Green and his abilities, and the fact that the music should shine brightly and be carried with unshakable passion."
"Peter, I will miss you, but be sure your music will live," added the 73 - year - old rock star.
“ I thank you for asking if I wanted to be your drummer all those years ago.
We did well, and we did quite a good job of paving the way for music that so many people have enjoyed.
"God be with you, my dear friend... with love and respect, Mick Fleetwood."
Green’s death was confirmed by Swan Turton’s law firm: “The family of Peter Green reported with great sorrow that Peter died this weekend, peacefully sleeping.
A further declaration will be published in the next few days."
Green leaves behind a daughter, Rosebud Samuel-Greenbaum, whom he had with his ex-wife, Jane Samuels.
Green founded Fleetwood Mac with Mick Fleetwood and Jeremy Spencer, but the band was originally called "Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac Featuring Jeremy Spencer".
After four records, however, the singer left the band in 1970.
Fleetwood Mac was going to have a lot of praise and popularity around the world after more people joined the band, including Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks on Rumours and Tusk records.
Prince Jehoakim’s feeling was said to be constant
Jóakim Danaprin, the younger son of Mary Thorhild of Denmark and Henry of Danaprin, is still in a hospital in Toulouse, France, where he took surgery on the day before because of blood clots in the brain.
The Danish government radio, DR, according to the spokesman of the Danish court, says that it is uncertain how long the 51 - year - old prince will be in the hospital, but his feelings are stable.
According to a report by DR, the effect of the blood clot on the prince’s health is now being investigated.
This is reported by Dr. Peter Qvortrup Geisling, who deals with health issues for DR, that the consequences of a blood clot in the brain often do not occur until days after surgery.
“It can range from minor symptoms to paralysis, memory problems or difficulties in expressing, ” says Geisling.
He says the prince could wait for months of rehabilitation.
Joakim Danaprins, full name Joachim Holger Waldemar Christian and also Count of Monpezat, stayed in the family vineyard, Château de Cayx in South France when he fell ill on Friday night.
He was first transferred to a hospital in the town of Cahor, near the ranch, and then moved to the University Hospital in Toulouse, where he underwent surgery for blood clots in his brain.
Google Pixel 4 can form the Milky Way galaxy
A double optical attraction enables the extra lens of Pixel 4 to be seen in a three-dimensional dimension, giving a better picture background than in previous Pixel phones, which fully trusted the software to produce these so-called "bokeh" effects.
In order to demonstrate the quality of the camera, Google’s legendary photographer Annie Leibovitz got to the stage to discuss his experience in photography with Pixel 4 in the past 12 months.
Computer studies are still in the foreground in all aspects of new Google smartphones, and in this phone “computer - controlled photography” is new to improve HDR+ settings by combining up to nine different images.
New dual lighting controls offer different brightness and shadow modes and allow users to preview HDR+ in real time.
The phone also relies on mechanical engineering to offer better automatic whitening and improved night vision, which is so sensitive that it can capture the galaxy on the night sky.
In addition to other cameras, Pixel 4 Soli presents a "satellite" signal on the front of the phone that detects Motion Sense movements so that users can release the sheet, turn off the timing, close the alarm, or turn off the sound of the phone by waving a hand.
All calculations of Motion Sense are carried out on the device instead of connecting the Internet and the same applies to enhanced Google helpers, as the technician now emphasizes reducing the response time and improving the privacy of the user.
Google’s continued emphasis on making full use of its machine learning capabilities has also resulted in a new voice recording app that directly transcribes sound without sending data to the Internet.
The app is currently only available in English, but more languages are expected.
Pixel 4 will also be the first phone to support Google Stadium, a scene in the cloud launched on November 19th in the United States, but after that it will report the date for Australia.
In addition to new Pixel phones, Google also introduced a new Pixelbook Go Chromebook computer and another generation of Google Pixel Buds hearing aids.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smartphones, which are expected next year, are completely wireless and have sound adjustments that listen to the environment and constantly adjust the sound to match it so that clarity is the greatest.
The new Bluetooth 5.0 smart hearing aids are completely wireless and adjust the volume according to the noise around you.
Google also reported an update of its connected Wi-Fi home bone in the Nest WiFi line with a special bone along with many basic sites that work together to improve wireless connection within the home.
The new Wi-Fi system, which will record the Nest name, doubles its predecessor and adds built-in microphones and speakers to use the Google Wizard at each base of the home.
It is sold in Australia on November 5, and costs 399 a year for the bone and one Wi-Fi point or 549 dollars for two Wi-Fi points.
Google Home Mini has also been updated, but a new 79-dollar Nest Mini improves the sound quality by doubling the bass and has received a built-in wall fixture.
All Google Smartphones will have a new call system capability for communication between devices at home as well as the ability to call Nest Mini outside the home using the Google Home app.

Lecce is four points behind Genoa, which is 17th and is one game ahead.
"Sweeted to throw a bottle of beer in a sale" in Devon
A pole hunter threw a bottle of beer into a sale when he interrupted the fishing line, according to a charity.
Pictures taken at Hope's Nose near Torquay seem to show you on a rock that throws a lot toward an animal.
Duncan Kenny, who took the pictures, said the grey seal had been fishing when the pole hunter emptied the bottle and threw it behind the animal.
Kenny called it “a terrible and careless behavior. ”
He said he was picking up garbage at this beautiful place in Devon last Sunday morning together with other people in the Celebration Society Seal Project when he witnessed the attack.
"The soul tried to get into the fishing line," he said.
“ The poacher reached the beer, emptied the bottle, and threw it into the sale.
"The bottle fell on the back of the salesman and he swam away."
A teacher said that “luckily, ” while selling strong animals, the seller had simply been doing what was inherent to him.
"By throwing a glass bottle in him you are stopping him on his fishing," he said.
The Seal Project Society said that this was "not an isolated incident" and that it had recently received "many reports of this aggressive behaviour".
The Society’s Facebook account says that its volunteers collected 12 bags of garbage in the collection at Hope’s Nose on Sunday and that “many examples of anti-social behaviour” had been seen.
All salesmen are protected by the laws for the protection of seals, and people are asked to stay away from them.
A giant from the Christian pool in Laxá, Dálla
The first centurion was caught in Laxá in the valleys later today.
It was the work of Arnor Isfjörð Gudmundsson.
This morning, he had put in a hideous place in the Christian pool, and she was six inches [89 cm] long.
After noon, he was back on the Christian scene, thinking of a story he had heard that the slowness would take more time after the horrors had spread.
With this in mind, he went with the king of Collie Dog and threw over the Christian pool.
Soon he was taken and, as he himself tells.
“ After about five seconds, he cleaned himself up completely, and I realized that it was the meter.
I got stressed because I had 11 pounds of tea.
Usually I grab fish, but I had it for forty minutes.
In fact, he was quite comfortable.
I took a few trips up and down the pool, but then I got to strand it, and it was a great feeling.
Crawl off my pole and jump on it.
And he measured two hundred and twenty-two inches, and I disputed him, and said a merry hunter in the fisherman's house in Laxah, in the valleys, in conversation with Scorpions.
Arnor's like no beginner when it comes to a hundred calls.
That was his eighth.
He was given such fish in blends, Black Seas, Black Seas, Chalks, two in Langadalså, and one in Ranga Island.
There is a fine fishing in Laxá, Dála, according to Arnor.
Tomorrow’s hollet, which will finish at noon, has 35 salmon, and our man has 18 of them.
Expecting a Great Flood for Hannah
Hanna, the first Atlantic hurricane of this year, reached Texas, U.S.A., last night.
Hannah quickly lost power and became stormy, yet there has been heavy rain in the area and is expected to be a vast flood.
Thus, it is expected to rain up to six inches [30 cm] in one day, but in special locations it could reach as much as four inches [46 cm], according to the AP newsmagazine.
In particular, we are warned of dangerous floods that could occur as a result of the rain.
The area where Hannah reached the country has been hit by the widespread spread of the new coronary virus there.
In addition, seas have gone ashore and caused damage.
There are now at least 43,700 people without electricity, and there are many relief stations in the area.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, made a fuss about the hurricane last night and said it was important that people listen to experts and follow instructions.
Below you can see the footage taken by the AP Newspaper’s filmmaker this morning.
House burned, stores robbed and inside damaged
More than sixty are dead and sixty more wounded after attack in the village of Masteri in the Darfur region of Sudan yesterday.
The attack “was the most recent in a series of serious security incidents in the last few weeks in which houses were burned, shops and markets were robbed and the interiors damaged, ” according to the United Nations Office of Human Rights in the capital of Kartum, which was sent out today.
Abdalla Hamdok, prime minister of Sudan, has announced that security forces will be sent to the region’s war plaza to “protect the inhabitants and the harvest. ”
Only two days ago, an unknown army in the area killed at least 20 general citizens, including children, in a second attack.
"The suppression of violence in different parts of the Darfur region is leading to increased upheavals, endangering agriculture and threatening people's lives and livelihoods," says the United Nations.
The conflict in Darfur, in western Sudan, began in 2003 when most Arab rebels rose up against the governor of Kartu.
The forces of government and Arab forces, who tried to stop the rebellion, have been accused of widespread atrocities, but some 300,000 were killed in the battles, according to the United Nations ’ assessment.
Omas al-Bashir, who was overthrown by a chair as leader of Sudan, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocides and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Meanwhile, new governments in Sudan are trying to negotiate peace with major rebel groups.
TV reporters thank viewers for noticing cancer nodules
TAMPA, Florida (AP) — A TV newscaster in Florida is grateful to an observer for having noticed a knot on her neck and e - mailed her that she should have him checked.
Victoria Price, a WFLA reporter in Tampa, took this advice and was diagnosed with cancer.
Price said on Twitter that she was going to have surgery on Monday to remove the tumor, the thyroid gland, and some lymph nodes.
“The doctor said it was dispersing, but not too much, and we’re hoping that this will be my first and last operation,” she said.
The audience sent Price an e - mail last month and said that the knot reminded her of the knot she had had.
Price, a 28 - year - old researcher, said this week that her screenplay was “8 on your side. ”
“ But the role was recently changed when the audience was in the presence of ME and I couldn’t be more grateful, ” said Price.
“ I’ll be forever grateful to the grateful woman who made the effort to send me an e - mail, a completely unknown woman.
She had no obligation to do so, but she did so anyway.
Speaking of being with a man in the team."
Parts of the Jeronimo Open Space outpost temporarily closed after two plain wolf attacks – CBS Los Angeles
Two were bitten by coyotes near the Oso Creek walkway on Jeronimo Road in Mission Viejo on Saturday morning and had to close the route temporarily.
Laura Wittmer says she sees a coyotes almost every morning, and she usually tries to avoid them, but on Saturday morning one came right at her and bit her foot.
The route has been closed while the attacks are being investigated.
"Today, two different parties announced that the coyotes had bitten a human being. "The animal welfare service Mission Viejo is working in collaboration with the Fish and Animal Life Division and part of Jeronimo Open Space has been closed. Be careful and watch out when you are traveling where there is a lot of wild animals."
Wittmer tried to knock off the coyote with a bottle of water.

Contestants of racial hatred collide with the Seattle police
On Sunday in Seattle, a conflict between police and Protestants against racial hatred ended with the arrest of a number of people, but discontented with public relations because of President Donald Trump’s plan to send a number of federal policemen into major cities.
Opposition to racial hatred and police violence has arisen following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis, May.
On Saturday, protestors in Seattle cut bicycles and broke windows in trailer homes on protests, causing police to declare riots and empty the streets with pepper sprays and blasts.
In addition, protestors set up trailer booths on a construction site for a future juvenile prison.
The police said they had arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen had been injured.
The rally was held in support of the protests held in the neighboring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the spotlight after Trump ordered very controversial radical action by federal policemen, in the presence of unsolicited local authorities, who say the police exercise excessive authority.
Conventional walks have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as in Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in downtown on Saturday night, according to the police.
At the same time as the protests, Trump is increasingly fighting harder and harder to re-elect in November, and has adopted a tough police policy.
