Triumph of the right populists in Austria, total they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the so far great coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the preferred parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the table.
In contrast, the election leader of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian governor Jörg Haider, is ready for a triumphal return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP cut even worse, which loses almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially of the People's Party, which had demanded the previous elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time expressed its fears, the 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even caused sanctions by the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to work with each party and started from a return to Vienna to Austria's federal policy.
The Green Party was also involved in Parliament, but suffered minor losses and, among the Austrian political parties, moved from the third to the fifth place.
No other party probably mastered the four-percent-thirty and consequently did not enter Parliament either.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
In the view of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, if the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of bugs could not be solved, there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't work out, then sure, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only take a hard turn.
In spite of all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted from the charge and received a fine which the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case-law falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be Mukherdshi's view that it would be best for him to go to a higher court in appeal.
He could thus seek release for bail and wait in freedom for his judgment, the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed himself in the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to have the condemned "competent legal support" indicated to the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such assistance would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit this," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, he confirmed the Czech Republic's importance in the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether the Indian side had given him the promise to deal with the matter was not given by the Minister.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he simply noted.
A Czech judge over the ringing around the seabed
It enters an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it to and to it.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the seabed has a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here, oil can be found, further ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry, for example, the key to the development of a medicine for cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The border states today declared their claim to the new sea areas.
Under a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches to some hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the shores of the sea, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the relevant Commission country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently encountered the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly enlarge its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Further countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is called "common heritage of humanity" by the Convention, begins.
No State has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted to an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a land of gold graves," says Mikulka, an exaggeration director, adding that "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interocean Metal".
In 1991 it was granted the status of a so-called "road-breaking investor" under the Convention, as did investors from a number of other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the Pacific Ocean of ClarionClipperton between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"There you can promote on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the legendary scheme that the legend has brought to life after the golem.
German Special Forces were on site in the event of hostage-relief
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
More and more details of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are becoming known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the rescue operation involved German specialists indirectly.
According to this, both the German Federal Armed Forces and GSG 9 officials were the Fliegerstaffel der Bundespolizei, the Bundescriminalmt as well as logistics experts from the Technical Aid Agency at the place of liberation.
However, as ministers continued to report on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government had adopted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"Unfortunately, this has not been done," said a speaker from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19th in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged back and forth.
Until recently, the identity of hostages remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have arrived in Cairo in the meantime.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" magazine, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US representative house refuses rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollar-heavy bailout package for the financial markets almost fail.
The Dow Jones went to the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to curb chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion-dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for agreement, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The concern of investors was that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, he crashed again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence on the international financial markets.
The agreement of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing booking rates
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
Travel bookings for the coming months have significantly increased sales compared to the previous year according to a study - for the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire for travel remains undiminished, according to a study.
When booking for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking figures for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales increase of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
These results are based on figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is calculated for the total market.
The travel bookings were made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the US was particularly required, the DRV informed.
Here the booking increase was around one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local branches of Germans, are particularly sought-after destinations.
In particular, package travel is high in the course, said DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising cost of energy and food, the costs "are better calculated for the customer than for the individually organised holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that there will be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-ski-hits in the endless loop, beer made of liter-krügen and celebrities in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronsucker and I really don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, a television moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Just three minutes in the meadow, the photographers are already crashing on us and pinching the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white sausage quator, the feeling of well-being in the costume remained limited until now.
But once on the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather trousers; no one looks opposed or embarrassingly touched - all perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirty apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I had tied the apron wrong: "Lefts hoast fri, mid virgin, right granted, back weltwet."
Secretly, I set the loop from the back to the left.
"Pass," said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretch the bare backside to an unsolicited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's drained himself of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of whom think he's a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbiesler."
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in crowds across the fairground, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered carriage from tent to tent.
This works as with most meadow visitors: Empty, full back.
You can't see who's in the Promille-Sarg under the plane.
"These are the ones that goartemer pack," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared in the mire.
Name of the accident victim notified by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after she was hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living at Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later she died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicion of reckless driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is about to collapse
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket switch, there is no doubt about the majesty of the project, the westernmost access of which was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late mover in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to implement the Middle East, by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and further beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects paralyzed during World War I.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has slowly collapsed, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it, to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Judicial and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a virtually new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key points of this new foreign policy, I have taken the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the AKP headquarters, a specially made, state-of-the-art stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half finished shopping centers and pubs in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then highlighted one point that almost everyone I was talking about here said routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be able, in the transferred sense, to drive Europe as a whole on the same railway line east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry that was supposed to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least then there seemed not to be much doubt as to which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (after the 11th of September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and was the only one thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never let go for years.
How often did death stop us from "letting the music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never masterful, but never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply "went to house with one or two famous horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your follow-up to William Woodruff (September 25,) you write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship ... while he was studying for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Jenseits von Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctorate on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the "British rubber industry".
He was born in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Leben' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in the documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always do with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limo offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical fines that make it possible to save even more comfortable driving and gasoline.
Changes before the coming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made in this big limo are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation has appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon regarding its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimate is 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, which is 6.7 % of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the emergence of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year all over the world.
According to the Japanese producer's market estimates, 50% of insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase of dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new spatial flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double loading area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres higher than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneously provides high torque power for the entire engine run.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6 000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min.1 .
This petrol engine - the previous model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, he now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS-Model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.'s technical development center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan security sign.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan security sign.
But the most important thing is the bee's facets, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, allowing them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a ruddery microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for the avoidance of the collision
`At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles, ' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate up nor down, but can't cross; he can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs to process the information every few seconds and act on this information.
It does not require to store either the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can continuously work with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesies to introduce in the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite, to lead up to the target while driving, thereby avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's shaking before she's charged with a mortgage.
It must be recognized that the US Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not in vain.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the involvement of US citizens in mortgage stories of allegedly eligible banks, an entertaining and informative game has been developed for the Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley makes her capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been published, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stocks at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the share's price of August 31st.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, dropped by 6.79% at 17.00 GMT to 23.07 dollars.
`This strategic link represents an important opportunity to speed up the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley took on this status last week, which should enable him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
`A week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, we said that the participation would consist entirely of ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of the profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money provided by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
A press spokesperson of the group, however, refused to provide more precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a pay-as-you-go rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, he had 'clearly' reduced his balance sheet.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their exchange rate went down by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity accelerated.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic is re-founding around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorial Rafael Correa.
It was the third person who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, made the plan of a new constitution a choice.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted in the referendum with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% voted with 'No', 7% of the ballot was invalid and 0.7% was empty.
In order for the Constitutional Project to be adopted, one vote has to be achieved more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polls and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and it was prophesied 63% to 70%.
By the way, on the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito and congratulated the Equatorialians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bacheloret.
The election, held in silence in accordance with the observing decree of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is committed.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and by the currencies, sending emigrators to the country.
The project, driven by the Correa elected in 2006, will also allow the Head of State to exercise more extensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce with 13.9 million inhabitants in this country, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
At the end of the day, it also intends to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a base for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital in the afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly to Maadi Hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated, without being able to speak to the press.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid a ransom', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After being captured at an off-road car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya on 19 September, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers.
These are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, one border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board of two helicopters, started the attack at night shortly before dawn.
`On both sides shots were shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled', said the responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support through German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is located, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units', he explained without further details.
He also disputed that a ransom had been paid.
On the night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle with a patrol, in which the kidnappers were killed by six of them, including the leader of Chad, and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately challenged this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that are dying?
Which politicians will dare to remind the federal government that they neglect their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbours it is written in the constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of Quebec’s historical societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, are trying to deal intensively with history, save with a few groceries the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries want to break down the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states make available a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Authority’s representative.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the Bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell some of its holdings, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The Fortis shares started a steep downhill last week, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios were already taking place.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bust.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year-old depth.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the Group's market value is EUR 14 billion, which according to management is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion cost-effective American rescue package and the resulting market uncertainty are due to the Fortis shares valley.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed Governor General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interested party with a factual offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should shake his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been plagued.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken stable
Because of a person's drug consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox with the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking write data.
Insurance sets the fees and the amounts of payments in the event of damage, depending on the health of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer's identification number, he takes the data from the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, that is, what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer is suffering from and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it would be possible to conclude that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurances only have to deal with the paperwork more, but there are less difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraines and heat waves, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurance company's point of view, whereas the previous ones are not.
For the collection and processing of the data, own companies have formed themselves, who, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although omissions have not yet been handed down.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and combine them with the data on drug consumption. This gives them an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned cannot possibly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to some extent the grace of the fox.
Global menu from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, too, the French-Indian Summit is taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and codecision in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, and the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to an increase of over EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that in future air transport will also be stimulated.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nine among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also condemned.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides guilty of failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, i.e. that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to close a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050, as was the case with the proposal.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
Today, the head of government of India is visiting the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to Agency reports, the Agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for right-wing acquisition.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over 171,790 square metres of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 m2 exhibition area "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion numbers, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sections.
Found the missing little plane of billionaire Steve Fossett a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which disappeared on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The parts have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely removed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, which has been sent out to a force. Now we have the security that it is about the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or its vicinity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that only a few hours after the aircraft was sighted a team was sent out, identifying the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border with Nevada, some of the personal items of Fossett were found from a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identifications with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fosset had been abandoned one month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long succession of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth race, when the first man to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his numerous records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ads you don't expect
A Suv that falls through its original design and the special line design, the exhausting surface and its clear angles from the traditional schemata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to breathe new breath into the sector.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October onwards.
Thus, the commercial drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, where 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como will give a special look to the whole: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated in all its details in different moments to reassemble it as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes's concern with this advertisement is to introduce a new kind of copyright clip into this more stereotyped field.
But will it be successful in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with opposing fans.
The group's origin is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups of Campania and Apulia came to Sofia.
They carry the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
Of the Figc, 144 cards for the game were made available to Italian fans: all were displayed by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, no one was involved in an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were thus denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified tifosi may expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't put a foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be removed immediately, and that such behaviour does not in any case provide the opportunity for justification," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of Italian ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Authority) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (in plain terms expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia was founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but no doubt this was a disgrace to these 150-200 people.
"I am not a sociologist – add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are committed in the land of their actions.
So far, this group had been in awe, but now it is necessary to consider what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the whistles during Mameli's hymn: this too is no crime, but allow me to, because the education is missing..."
