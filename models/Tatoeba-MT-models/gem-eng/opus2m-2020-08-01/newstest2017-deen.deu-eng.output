28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother said that he can't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "At last he went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, and notified the San Francisco Judicial Medical Department.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, had his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our condolences are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was living in hostels first, but that, "things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone trying to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way to connect with his family was to always cook something, prepare dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who was swimming with the electricity.
"With everything that goes wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the SFPD's emergency call under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get glued up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to always be perfect and successful."
"Really, these things are rather clever to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is regarded as "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, form TVs with easy boobs and Mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glow, they raise the question of children's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Children's Game" Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some of his colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home to the food troughs in a quick gallop.
One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He was led by his family over the installation of the ALRV, not even for photo purposes on a horse.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and with it also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports assistant presented the Golden Pyramid to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala.
There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesvertstkreuz, Silbernes Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has nobled him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sports success, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the young.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was added to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
Among the distinguished are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fenders Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Shockmöhle and posthumous handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative society moved to the jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on taxation and energy policy as well as on a question of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
He will go back massively on regulations, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money to do so.
That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say almost literally.
The democratic candidate announces even the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical tea party wings.
So Trump could still have some internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and re-establish coal-fired power stations in the USA.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas that have been protected so far, and he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Change Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand the renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: The minimum wage must rise, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the major debate in the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to stimulate growth.
His critics argue that this would only make the budget deficit even bigger.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand that the rich pay more taxes, and whose critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fledgling woman has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is not more than a year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes she's being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the division manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and is concerned, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - nor as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope bearer," she says.
For women, other reasons for escape prevail: "Many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out."
In their home country, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsiveness, genocide, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what keeps her going.
On the run, it goes on.
"For example, that towing for a bottle of water requires sexual action is not a rarity," Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany, this will end, error tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in the apartment in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been created voluntarily".
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too great."
Because they often did not know how to help themselves, Bahr asks for more accommodation only for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question of whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of competence, some answered with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Schwaben, fledgling women are not accommodated separately," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesperson.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia, there are floors or private homes in some communities only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately."
"If the privacy is compromised or men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can occur - persistently -."
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women.
How much the women feel about this need for protection can be read on the Andang, which there is on the house in Munich.
"Since we talked about it, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Fighting assistants: Demands for new labour-fighting measures
Deputys of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new work-fighting measures in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on the entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" to problems which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Executive Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official renegotiations to all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour action, which begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to a six-time strike by assistant doctors this year, the first total failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be favourable and adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be imposed.
Russia and Turkey: An "Association of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed slimy and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restraining conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "lovely friend" Putin - according to a report quite five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me more like the opposite.
But one of Putin's most radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the rejection of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Putin handed out and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.
The offense was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vestry will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unreserved attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illicit oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this vehemently.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was almost disbanded from a failed coup d'état last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-season storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West as it sees its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.
In addition to this, there is the continuing grudge over the pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to take advantage of the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the elected government agencies after the coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid seafront palace enabled Russia and Turkey, as I was told by an analyst, to represent "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that are in violation of the West and feel ill-treated and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the RBS brand is only to be reduced to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since gone away when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategies used RBS to protect other consumer financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the retail business that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Brands, because how do we concentrate on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieved his 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th prize
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win on Friday at Newmarket.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won before on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilee when he takes the victory on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have achieved before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been a fan of this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flag of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve- exciting.
A whole series of big tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs.
Three years ago he had difficulty at first when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not in the end for a long time - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th birthday.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement by the Kremlin it is that Putin "has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian Bureau without giving reasons".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it is said that he was later the head of protocol and staff of the government staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and had recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step has made Moscow a mystery hub.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, here are only a few convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is the result of a kind of power struggle here?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to conduct Russian environmental policy at once - was a great sceptic.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me with these very complicated posts - you might say almost - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the position in December 2011.
He was former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, since Putin's third term of office would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another neighboring ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical conflict last month in the Los Angeles series.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
According to the statement of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of the release of Gibson's character from the series following a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've been in my whole heart blood for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can ever wish for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for 28 September.
Puzzles about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spewed out by a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blowers", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire decks are in place and the final section of the deck is today in Rosyth a Bethongus for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first lock is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the lock represents forward-looking construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last street deck section and its connection with the Nordturm deck in the extension, we had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 mm south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Heil, because the tolerances that the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men still have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around in its vicinity and introduced ourselves to the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond its reach until we let it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it got rid of the person who was driving the boat when the boat was no longer there.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Severely injured - Man leans on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut his ex-girlfriend's clothes apart.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by the hand and the body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her partner.
On the street they met the ex-husband of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be much more obliged in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
At the next Council meeting, the SPD proposes a "Living Action Concept".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: who is going to build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments will have to be designated as social housing in the future."
However, the favorable apartments can also be built in stock.
However, the big issue at the City Hall was, says Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as possible 20 percent of homes as social homes."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tougher conditions for investors.
Despite this, says Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is exacerbated.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the professionals.
However, the programme is still not complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway.
How, though, does one compare with the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments whose promotion will end in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, according to planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, now expiring ties should be purchased from the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to bringing homes back to price fixing.
This is possible in the West Town.
At one stroke the problem was solved.
Because in the West Town the end of the year expires.
About 1800 apartments could be returned to the price fixing for cheap apartments.
Only: this is what the owners want, the housing companies don't want.
Because the number of social housing in the West Town is again dramatically increased, one distances itself from the goal of so-called mixing.
There should be no concentration of social weaknesses in only a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect there to be still movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must join the boat."
Although it has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.
What does not mean, however, that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games and last but not least on smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go Mad, an app based on the characters that were created initially for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest drop before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Market entry in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players with their smartphones go outside and search for Pokémons who are being tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "caught".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person spends every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the market launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" run into deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that is fun for them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are gamblers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's going on?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps such as Fitbit were able to track our activity in the past, they gave us no reason to play sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and the use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with being active in the real world, helping many people to hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenturn
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
Don't worry about it on the bar.
Breathtaking on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast climbed up to the multi-combat title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the suspended beam during the women's single more battle in the art tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-game title and a total of the fifth, while strengthening her reputation of being the best of her generation or even even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
For the past three years, Biles has dominated her sport, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after winning gold and silver each in the single multi-combat final of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles got the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the farewell celebration of the retired team coordinator Martha Karoleyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises - which include her typical Tumbling Pass - are adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and trained by Trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym, in which Boorman trained, became a force.
Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost any more competition, a victory series that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led through two rotations easily, the image was blurred.
Swivel beams and ground tournaments - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lubricated.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and put one more on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her end – a pure formality – and tears flowed upon Bile's shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her grounding, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killers shot in the car while listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot and killed in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade, while they were entertaining in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks in hispanic residential areas within four months and two more were injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a CBS subsidiary, at the beginning of the month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown niche from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the ground.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Mikrozephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved.
What's not right at all -- of course you've been getting involved in it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest that they institutionalize him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know people were still doing'," said Picciuto.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life and he still cannot speak.
But he's progressing slowly.
He can run with support and ride a bicycle.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund designed for "Please sing something in front of me"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect it to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call the emergency on Friday. It is expected to take more rains all Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods following extreme rains, reported the National Weather Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that requests for tankers, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service indicated that there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach the record level after the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will only slowly flow through the creased rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level recorded on Friday at 9.00 am.
Rescue teams still flocked from the floodwaters in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water streamed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood "had spread rapidly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities hesitated to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer in the vicinity of Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the ground has been largely covered by rains.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa turned up 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the City Administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as being flooded, but no one has been reported yet on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets", survived shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia was shot, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the loin, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe it.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were just investigating whether one of the injured men might be the perpetrators.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron sleeves for storm guns that were traced back to various storm guns overlooked the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walk, there were sleeves.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police officer Anthony Ginaldi to the Philadelphia police.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently reviewing reports of the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another six-year-old girl was hit by a crossover at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She'll recover and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
That's what I'm introducing myself to under the Women's Olympics in the tournament for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three Turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and the Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fortified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the final Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they supplied unexpected but masterful gymnasium routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-game event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the tip of this sport, but that's not how gym classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same route as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournament women in the team. Moreover, this is last year with Marta Karoleyi as a coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnastics primarily in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents for the training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnastics and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We must enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to train more easily and easily.
I founded my 20-year gymnastics foundation.
At my events we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer young people high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" through the fetching of Olympic team gold and thank you for taking so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election rejected him.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to impose the contract compulsorily and said that the NHS was located in a "no-man's country" and any further delay would be harmful for the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night work and weekend work to improve care for the hours of the week.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Physicians, said in a communication last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will raise the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors properly."
In just eight weeks' time, until the first group of doctors falls under the new Treaty, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the disputes by means of discussions were in opposition to the government and sometimes to deafening silence.
This was a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the pressure and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, it has made it clear to the assistant doctors that they are ready to carry out further work.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since nurses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-fighting does not achieve anything of the little, but burdened teams and service providers already burdened up, and only prepare the patients, caregivers and their families worry, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Physicians and responded positively to the concerns expressed by the Ministry of Health and other ministries regarding the protection and whistleblowinging.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional retirement period, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health to comply with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day drug after the authorities have recommended that more people be given it for a longer period of time.
The ticagrelor anti-caking drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, thus reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty materials in the artery walls that form coatings.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clots the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clot the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft guidance of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a second heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the occasion of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud being deliberately ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and councillors to ignore evidence of abuse of elections due to "ethnic and religious hypersensitivity".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now a king of anti-corruption, said that intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lock belts outside polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry a card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's fingers if they cast their vote to prevent anyone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud associated with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed himself in particular alarmingly about the fraudulent letter election - with the older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clear the electoral system, including the conduct of ID cards to prove the identity
His report states: "As proof was given that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists working on letter-taking documents to stop "choice harvesters".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for tougher registration reviews to prevent the electoral index from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before choosing.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists process complete letter choices and envelopes of letter choices.
The police give the power to set up lockouts for polling stations.
A legislative amendment that facilitates an intimidation charge in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 (National Representation Act 1983).
No photo ban in polling stations.
Request that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "unbelievable" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal charges were made.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for corrupt and illegal practices due to a litany," he said.
He has been convicted for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high standards of criminal law.
He also criticises the ineffective "abstinence controls" of the electoral registration departments of the City Halls.
Sir Eric said, "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, bears a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's double cyclist and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio came this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except for Rand and Band, who proved to be the impressive double-goer of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic woman is by far not the only gold-fighting athlete who has his own famous double-goer - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the US team in archery Brady Ellison, left, is compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double runner on the bike race track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in Archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures he sees appearing on to the Wolf of Wall Street Star were unimaginably similar.
In fact, the archer got the madness into the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great resemblance myself, except for facial hair," said Brady the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I think I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year: the all-round resemblance between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the entrance actor
Another ongoing comparison was made between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medallion swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans, a "athletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medallion winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which has its own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "dead like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimsuit was outrageous to viewers of the CBC live transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "began like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimsuit.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers all over Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swim party for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many spoke to him.
Twitter-User did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment about a swim performance."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end more than 90 times to the people who responded to the remark about Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on a show and to our followers on social media last night.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized to the mission and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimsuit in the CBC Olympic show," he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark outrageous about women who try in the middle of business shameless underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled it out and put it back into the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put them back into the shelf
One mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she got dressed again and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants out of the edition, took off her own pantyhose and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, naughty like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when they pulled out the underwear that obviously didn't like her, as she put her back into the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got dressed again and went out.
"They didn't seem to interfere with her watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underpants home that had another person and were not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman wore them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folkstone."
All eligible products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Arms Attacks With Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robber.
When you approach from behind, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the hand and twist him while the attacker crumbles against pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the barrel in his face and move backwards while they point the gun at him.
When attackers approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before they move backwards and point the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Take a look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember, it's safest for a robber to hand over your money - if you're not Grand Master Krav Maga.
Traveler Ian Wright scales his tongue for a guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangler reflex to a serious test - by rejecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, scoured his steps on a Euro sign, a rail at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before leaking every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to be into.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking off the sink button of a toylette that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left in his mouth more than a bad aftertaste.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to sinking buttons of toilets, the task was definitely to test his immune system
In the film he said: "As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample strip showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the luminometer number of newly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "This is getting close to the worst I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company employs Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We were running crazy brainstormings that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "Let me tell you this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all lactic acid bacteria in question were associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delegating Social home in Saltash, Cornwall
An asocial family left their social home after delegating with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown out after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden parts were torn apart, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.
The family have been relocated and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works at Cornwall Housing for the house administration, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is notorious, and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had caused the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the estate where drugs were used in the past, the wooden parts were torn up
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called regularly by the police
Cornwall Housing gave her and her partner an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw this week violently from the property.
The delogue was applauded by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were turned into hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the municipal house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since delegating is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously come to us and sent us the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedrooms of the house after delegating to the ground
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear up garbage dumps that surround the house
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were lubricated with graffiti.
The police say they're going to delegate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the delegating was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-proclaiming as well as to those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panicked after a deep-flying military jet crossed the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force made an incredible crash flight
Air forces reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost near the sun’s worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped as they, understandably, began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos on the dramatic fly-by in the social media, said: "It flew twice really deep by and there was a moment when it looked as if it were falling down."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane were falling down on me."
Tourists at the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility of nearby ground fires, but the air forces insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which limited his view
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries about Seville
Seville - Barcelona FC fights on Sunday for the first step towards winning the title in the new football season.
The Catalans take off in the duel around the Spanish Supercup towards Seville FC, and the replay rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from Neymar, among others with the inferior cuppinalist and ruling European League champion, who contests Brazil's Olympic football tournament.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
In training, the German experienced a stabbing in the knee, which has clarified the question of contact with Barca at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bravo.
For two years, the Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing for number one status in Barcelona.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far failed to make a clear decision on this matter and has left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other applicants.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. were not yet really convinced at 3:2 in the test race against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after renewal in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the Supercopa de Espana.
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5.4) in a one-sided finale.
With this, the world rankings first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made up the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympics was the former SVS-NÖ-Legioner Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their defenders loose on their own in the fair competition.
"I played the matches up here for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the final," Zhang said.
After the game gold and silver medal winners posing with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
After that he set the speed at the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected raging match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter finale against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white horse had suffered a rib injury and was then in medical treatment, had to be "finally" satisfied with sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become in similar high table tennis age Olympia-four.
Donald Trump admits huge problems′′ in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republicans is plagued by massive concern that their majority should also be reduced in traditional conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment when the multimillionaire who usually appeared in a large-scale and self-confident manner expressed such concerns as those reported by correspondents.
After he threw 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Blame if false reports about his candidacy, he took up his famous media shell again.
Republican Hochburgen Wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were in a similar situation.
Other institutions see Trump in the front, but not by the distance that is common to Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be at risk.
In an interview by the broadcaster CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wants to stop Clinton's advance: "Just as I have done so far".
And pushed after: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that would be all right, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is supposed to have threatened to cancel funds to support its campaign, should it not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for Congress want to be more vulnerable.
Olympia: Driedster fraud in Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission on this case.
Kenya's athletes are threatened by the second doping event at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After an attempt at fraud at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent home a trainer.
The International Olympic Committee informed that it would immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today's Coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This had been reported by the Doping Controllers to Kenya's team leader.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case in order to work out its own investigations.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation", it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping Control Station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, giving up the sample and signing it," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the Athlete's accreditation, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World Cup fourth.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics director Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He should have informed athletes of upcoming doping tests against money payments from his country.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping events.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 Doping Goal Controls prior to the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
Subsequently, WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping control is in line with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a large nation of runners.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports by the ARD, allegations have been made that Kenya’s Doping funds are easily accessible and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been widely and systematically doped.
Russia's athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary a childhood dream.
In the orchestral excavation of the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her affection for Tony with bitterness while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She resembles me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria, according to reports.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was assumed that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the bombing of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she was planning to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - preventing people from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain in the event of a election victory with Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman from Reid later said that he had not talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he speculates.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the U.S. Supreme Judge for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked Garland's nomination as Lakaia and helpers of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the Presidential Office.
Treats wants nude calendars for "women and men"
The treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool-Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does too.
"We have to return to the representation of timeless and classic nudity, in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and World.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand", the association chairman Ali Toprak believes.
Because of the hard work done by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count on tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," says the association chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already surpassed Kurdish strongholds with criminal action months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the shattered coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks are added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Aleutian cities.
Erdogan wanted to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the last hundred years," said Toprak, a CDU member.
The head of the Association demanded that the Federal Government "as sharply as Austria is positioned against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionals.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As reported by the newspaper under reference to the figures of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already the largest group of the asylum-rights recognized for political persecution in Germany.
As of 30 June, this had been 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all recognized as eligible for asylum (39,625).
This survey does not include those who fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. by state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the heavy parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not as stupid as it's been until now: summer holidays, heat and country elections - it's biting.
The locals who are supposed to be convinced by the electorate are on vacation.
The most common holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so do not choose the Landtag.
There are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, blow up balloons, distribute flyers and at the end count voices, only effortlessly.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again to let election campaigns pass just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Selling, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must fear his office.
The SPD, since 1998, the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong newcomers AfD cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Selling, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as it did his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelerring got cold feet and blamed Chancellor Merkel on the AfD's bloom.
Her refugee policy, her "We can do this," has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make the right campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major conferences; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group was wrong, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berliner and Saxony there as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But nobody from other parts of Germany is sorry to hear Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely refrains from the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and from shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that on the land you have broken the ground, that it has to make a lot of effort to find another wire to the people.
It's like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there's not much to be found in the vastness of the country.
The council of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow fighters, however, is also self-evident: "They must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village feasts, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Selling has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.
In the polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had achieved a clear 35.6 percent win in front of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small parties with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the Landtag.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday need and largely transfer their campaign to the Internet.
"Online election campaign", it calls country president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters go looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just swirls through the Mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and also finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27-Refurbishment: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
At the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished, there is nothing to tease.
For those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and only ends at 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They've made everything pretty tight," Elvira Tetzlaff says about the jet tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to the mid-term, until the end of October everything should be done.
It is also commended to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the installation of emergency exits.
Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and the barrier of the Aspergstraße has also been lifted in Ofterdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
The citizens can now travel on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The evasive traffic through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, Deputy Head of the Department for Traffic Management of the Refurbishment.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of them were looking for a trail and more familiar with their navi than the signs.
As a result, some trucks were turned upside down in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not observed, the municipality strongly demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were considerable exceedances," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was on the move at 77 hour kilometers in the 30-zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, but it has become calmer.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen are not happy to look into the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has led them to sales breakdowns, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produces for other companies, for which the refurbishment has hardly any consequences.
Even at the Maier Autohaus Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that of course "the running knowledge is missing".
The most heavily occupied are the locals along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
This is already threatening to exist.
Not only he, but all the restaurants have "hit it hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro sales.
The loss in turnover is estimated at "more than 50 percent".
The road renovation had "returned its operation by two years".
He had to release half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President-in-Office of the Government Jörg Schmidt asked Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now they must also bear the disadvantages of the renovation.
Göhner knows about other districts, where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regulars now look by less often because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't get here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his main clientele will come back after the completion of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner maintains the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being tightened.
Following recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière is now presenting a comprehensive security package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all of that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciler.
All his proposals were "politically reasonable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in presenting his new security package.
They don't exaggerate anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was based on results and on an "attractable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière left a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more likely to do so.
Some things are already known, announced, suggested: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière will start a second round of proposals that have not yet been related to the SPD: he wants to penalise the promotion of sympathy for terrorist groups and to force jihadists with double citizenship into the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything, which the coalition partner has no chance of doing anyway.
Some new ideas are also presented by de Maizière.
Some of them have it in themselves: he plans rapid procedures for deportations and more ways of detaining people from deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally delicate.
Some also seem unanswered and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example, in dealing with the inequality of patience - the question arises: What does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to argue that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were concerned about safety.
And things that were deeply occupied by people could not be ruled out even in election times.
Internal security has become an enormous focus.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in favour of internal security.
In the past few days, the two parties have come up high.
Only a heated dispute over the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some of the Union's internal ministers, in which the department leaders also demand a ban on Burka and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying to make reconciliation.
From a departure from the double pass, he keeps nothing.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You're reopening, don't make sense.
And with a ban on Burka, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutionally fixed at all corners and whether it is actually "probable" for the coalition partner, it has to show itself.
There's a lot in there that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first gently signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still passing through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets is it running around.
In the recall operation, there are vortex around a term.
Volkswagen starts with deliveries of stalls in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest automaker can show an increase in the past year, despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 per cent fewer vehicles in the world with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, according to China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year.
In the German home market, deliveries dropped by almost one-sixth.
Brand Sales Manager Jürgen Stackmann returned the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a restraint on purchases by means of a "changed economic environment".
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's coup d'état, a spokesperson explained that the British vote on withdrawal from the EU had also been a burden.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas shops first escalated, there is also a reduction in beech.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected home brand of the Lower Saxony still comes through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop-out of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles will be booked.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to show a sales increase from January to July.
1.3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars does not have a negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the upgrade, the carmaker issued a "equity guarantee" certificate to the customer, but did not mention a "guarantee", as it was called in company circles on Friday.
Reasons are legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and of KBA."
"Derogations from these are not accepted," Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration occurs after the conversion of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power and all vehicle type approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "guarantee" but not what it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the conversion with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it was also important to avoid any other damage that would have nothing to do with the waste gas scandal causing any uncertainty as to possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savers to pay fines in future - as a second institute in Germany.
Bank Manager Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or daily cash accounts".
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no sign in it: Normal savers should "not fear to pay for their austerity penalty".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee will be refunded by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September onwards to private and corporate customers for deposits above 100,000 euros on Giro or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't lay down $4,000 for every million."
The costs are now passed on according to the polluter-pays principle.
Just leaving the cash in the Raiffeisenbank safes would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth one," said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian cooperative association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate is causing considerable costs for all banks".
To carry it alone, "continuously not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank-Filiale 2014 with fines for deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay comprehensive fees for deposits, and competition among banks and savings banks is far too strong in Germany."
A banker said that at Lake Tegern there was "a client who was somewhat more wealthy from his fortune".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it guards money free of charge.
Founded in 1911, Gmund cooperative bank has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
There are well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs in the region.
The Bavarian cooperative association "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate an outlay for deposits by private customers," said Spokesperson Ernst.
At the end of June, the president of the Bundesverband der deutsche Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, said: "The threshold of going into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the relocation of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys records?
Lonely men of middle age love records.
Before you rush to the comment section to ignore it under the pseudonym NotAllUnusualMenMenMenCentrals with rough insults, this statement is derived from up-to-date data.
According to YouGov, the much-discreet resurgence of records is not due to a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are expected to be between 45 and 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hoard by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walked in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stealing wildly before I stopped, holding my hands and saying something decisively like, "Well, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), undress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy from them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my vice.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are on the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and who are making themselves want to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations that I have had, people have usually done away with their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers started the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that wake up happy childhood memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an emptiness or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
It's like this for me as a collector, and I think it's like this for a lot of people.
It's a simple way to get busy spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a staff member floats off a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not heard them yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned as I browse through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "Trophan Aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-intensive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Popp, who has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roaring from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in the business for a few minutes now and is looking at the variety of records available for sale.
She makes a window bumper rather than a big shop.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a in love sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
As I appear to pattern the Jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plattenkunst".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and that some customers could send to the Sohos deep for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population who has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most on luxury items such as plates.
Even if my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they ignore, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street's record stores and sheets by plates, while avoiding the stark gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who has nothing to do with men of middle age above the shoulders.
The Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was in the hands of a female from which it is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer of demolition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the Calais authorities to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to set up 72 temporary shops in which persons inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they would be a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for expelling people who were doing the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais "are clearly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas provided quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downpour was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the Camp, which is run non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "was for these children a disaster of which the latest eight years old."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had increased to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic era, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I continue to watch the World Cup, remain confident and fight further," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time travel," said Martin.
He had to analyze in peace what reasons would have led to debacle.
Martin wanted to compete for the title at the time-travel World Championship in Qatar in October.
"I'm going to look at everything that we've changed lately."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54.5 km on the Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund misses semi-finals
The victory march of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter finale of Rio: the world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was able to spend her turn only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medallion Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian open-winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal in Sydney in 2000.
There were two German DTB starters in the quarter final of summer games last in 1992.
Never had a German duo in an Olympic single-half finale.
Group starts up for live video game transmissions at startup
Watching other people playing video games is a giant center - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the takeover, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam did not start up with his offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The player's activition Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which has previously been based in Seattle, Washington, United States, move to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamedi announced.
Therefore, the takeover should not change for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's lawn has to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal states, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash machines are being tested, which are supposed to transfer temposunder particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident priorities where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or refurbishments with temporary speed limits, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure that the speed limit is observed with a stationary lightning light.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.
The Forcement Trailer is authentic: its battery lasts for five days without interruption, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded over several tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the trailer in high-speed condition according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also bulletproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is designed to protect the flash from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: recently France reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain gets silver in the 7 rugby after Fiji Masterclass gets gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the shape of Fiji in the final on Thursday evening, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, reversing, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the finals.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It might be a comfort to GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind them.
Eight years ago, she lost to the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they only lost one.
This slumber will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs out of fun.
It felt like it was for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to walk in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau overtook the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely hit the ball.
A great tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reverberation and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou praised by another weak striker of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Seas islanders, whose fans sang, flags waved and danced on the stands.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-duple with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked to death in the lawn.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and the UK pushed South Africa into a narrow semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the coach for rowing victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games, and that's what it means.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard highs that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two sitting on the row, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed the second Olympic gold in the two without taxwoman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, at least her 39th unbeatable commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would survive this day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he's a little risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It slightly changes the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of the victory went her first thoughts about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a harsh rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught right now.
Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to be torn apart.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear at a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed out.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary for clarity
The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered "bayernwide exemplary".
A small Franconian drinking water destination association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was called in the original tone some time ago in a contribution of the Bavarian Broadcasting.
Some time later, the Water Forum of the Government of Unterfranken honoured the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "bayernwide as exemplary".
Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Verkehrsverband, is behind all of this 28 years as Managing Director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein Group's drinking water destination, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, supports about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
Water supply agreements exist for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed water guard in 1985 and was already appointed Managing Director of the Toileverband in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budget planning, charging of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the president.
As outstanding events, it mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new well (1994), land purchases in the new well (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the replacement of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stoppage and one has taken up innovations again and again because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water destination association and he has lived the water destination association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction before the Water Forum of the District of Unterfranken.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised the Aquarius Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at Kirchlauter's high tank on January 3rd.
This will have to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn was also maintained once only because the tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who begins the succession of Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example, if I ask him something that is two years behind when I sang Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at a multifamily house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) on Friday around 10.45 a.m. and injured her to death.
"The man himself called us and said that he had shot his partner," said a police spokesperson.
The perpetrator was on the run, after him being publicly given.
Meanwhile, since Sven S. could be on the road by car.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, muscular, brownish and has a glass.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a glass.
The man is not to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police speak of a "relationship state".
The victim was in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about the tether walk or the relationship between perpetrators and victims, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We don't say any more at the moment," said a police officer in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, there was a special operation command (SEC) at the crime scene.
Steel - light vision for German steel industry
The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs to millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from the promotion of eco-electricity are off the table.
It remained during the liberation from the renewable energy conversion of existing plants to so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I'm really glad that after two years of tough negotiations, we could finally achieve that."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to call on steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there was now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEG charge of 20 percent apply.
But these too are not raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity generation.
In this way, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts in the steel industry is of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'Steel Is Future' campaign, this is a first step."
"Continue to follow."
"Climate and employment objectives are also to be considered in the context of the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis of 2008.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world's largest producer country in China threw massive steel onto the world market in the face of the dwindling domestic demand.
European producers propose price dumping to Chinese steel groups.
In the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, the imposition of import duties on imports of steel shows an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have been elucidated.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.
With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced around six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the German Economic Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now declined in the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than that of the previous year.
In the coming months, the association will expect an improved order situation with increasing emissions.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing does Seniors Good
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, at the Lehramt-Studium she took the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test she feels balanced, happy and overall alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and mind.
Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives," says Erhard Hackler from the Deutsche Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, says Hackler.
Due to regular association, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Considering and organizing, being able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be challenging in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to retaining the sound of the voice at an age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of Senior Workers' Organizations.
In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, people who are ill remember long-lost events.
In addition, singing requires a special performance on the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing, there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes by?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the band sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the church leaders directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet search.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, advice Hackler.
Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats respond more sensitively than cats to the cries of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they kept the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can see the excitement of cat babies at the Miauen der Kleinen.
They respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens, who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary college and the medical university Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Kater also responds to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"It seems that the acoustic differences between the Miau are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study to be published on this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology" magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult kittens and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
They were on the one hand played out by little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, who were also lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who had not yet their own offspring, reacted differently to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when these calls were played by the much more excited kittens.
This ability may have been innate or developed with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males had responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans several times.
Some studies also showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski goes to Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
An important football game takes place again in Turkey for the first time after the coup attempt.
Before the duel of the archivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual".
Even in the imposition of the state of emergency after the fall-over attempt in July, the government meant that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the coup.
It is also not stopped before football.
The prosecution issued a warrant against the former Starkikker Hakan Sükür.
Thus, the instigator in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sukür is to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is being held responsible by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup.
Although the initial 90-day state of emergency still applies until October, it actually has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public squares throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers' club Besiktas are traditionally not one of the president's friends.
But what unites the great Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
There even the fans themselves agree - whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
It will reach Lukas Podolski again with the Cup winner "Gala".
The Cologneer proved his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first playing time as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he won the 10.0 win.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the trophy.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciliation conclusion.
After the pre-run K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also broke out early in the Europe League.
==References====External links==
The season wasn't good.
The cup was the only way to win something.
"We did that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the season was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Süper-Lig-Torschutzenkönig.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez, who had been contracted by the AC Florence and who had been lent to Besiktas only after the coup attempted not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
But the storm would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transmitted athletics probes can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The theme Doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympic Games.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping lock, had sued her right of start just before the games, was plucked out and built without mercy at her start (100 meters of chest).
There was a ghastly scene: with a smile she was still proud of the hall and had provoked her appearance.
When it was established that they would not get gold, the audience broke out in a cheerstorm.
However, there are many other athletes who, despite the Doping past, start at the Rio Olympics.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion run even faster than before, being over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and considered to be Usain Bolt's biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaika): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time World Champion had to remove a six-month barrier in 2010 after she was shown to be taking the painkiller Oxycodon.
She had had severe toothaches after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion from 2012, World Champion from 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the forbidden stimulus medium methylhexanamin.
Perkovic disputed the knowledgeable intake and was blocked for six months.
The four largest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favourite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staff/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time World Champion over 400 m, was tested positively in 2010 and was locked for 21 months.
A remedy for penis enlargement was responsible, said Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly one athlete was ever known for so many medals afterwards.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was found to have testedosterone doping.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia-Silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics due to a judgment of the International Sports Court.
At 80.04 m he is ranked second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The World Recorder and Gold Favoritin was not tested positively until May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion found evidence of the intake of a prohibited dietary supplement, the WADA World Anti-Doping Agency's block fell out mildly and ran out on July 13th.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday early.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital but had already been able to leave again.
Her journey home was planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also affect Austrian citizens is unclear at first.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this respect, according to Schnöll.
The Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, was first exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two bombs went up again, and another person was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near Patong, a beach popular with tourists.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the bombing set went into the air in a flowerbed in front of the Coast Guard area.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday early in front of journalists.
"We assume it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past few days, the authorities have received classified evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they usually do not target tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the bomb explosions now, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High safety risks (level 3) apply to the provinces of Narathivat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not recommended to travel in these provinces before unnecessary travel.
Increased safety risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This is also a major influence for the military in the years to come.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is doing itself good to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get hold of the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people had been killed in Bangkok in a popular Hindu scream - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitarian Movement" is in the direction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several national offices, the Constitutional Guards also put the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of efforts against the democratic fundamental freedoms of freedom," said the Constitutional Guard Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of its own identity by alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "Identitarians".
Maaten said that his authority had voted closely with the state authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of constitutional protection.
Generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
Islamists did this as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a meaningful advertisement for one's own business.
The propaganda is supposed to appeal to the people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
It's dangerous.
Last, there had been reports from several federal states on "Identitarian contacts" to AfD politicians.
Maßen said he had no knowledge of that.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind would only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain people who are extremist, and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legal and terrorist offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaten said that he would not be talking about new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have seen in recent years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are planning to attack asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or pan-European control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups had been formed at regional level or in social networks.
Concerned, it was stated that many abuses went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene.
That's the alarming thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals, or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically different or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or Left, but who then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremeism."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Hafte becomes internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was not seen in the TV images at times.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut-out was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended his career with a residual 48 seconds and finished 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still participating in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed in order to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since most athletes are running in ethopaedics, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Hafte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English boulevard "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he first hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter in a forerunner over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
==References====External links==
The 22-year-old at that time learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store in New Square has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., around 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the impending defeat of elections as closely as possible.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election campaign event in Florida.
If there's nothing to do with the election of the U.S. President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll go on vacation.
When Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he would not care: "Lastly, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, that would be all right, said Trump.
He described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters into trade with electric transporters
An electric spare vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The post office is planning to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter.
In the near future, the Group will start trading with the transporter.
The post office wants to offer its electric transporters on the free car market from next year.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months now, the company has been testing whether to sell their own self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example of craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-own manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and in the long run would like to see a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK management resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann is becoming all the more uncertain, the longer the success promised by him.
Turbulence at the head of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After once again disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of business management, the global number five of the industry is ahead of a new start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
With effect from 12 September, the Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert will resign from the Supervisory Board.
As early as 1 September, the Executive Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, informed the company.
He should officially assume the function of a "consultant" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the resignation, the company called "different views" on the long-term policy orientation.
Details didn't want to call a corporate speaker on Friday.
Whoever will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that shareholders were most recently disappointed by the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK summit since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case with BMW, the quants would do the same," it said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company had not been able to stop its downturn even in the second quarter of 2016.
With 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent with 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter was particularly detrimental to the company's declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The corporate depreciation of 139 million euros required in the Consumer Experience division resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros to the Group.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a further consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slides in corner of curvature in graves: Eight Injured
In the event of an accident involving 43 senior passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Aurich County) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police informed them.
According to Eisenach, the 66-year-old driver of a bus from a travel company had to avoid an accepted truck, which partly drove on the opposite road.
The bus came down the road to the right and slipped into a grave, as a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Because of the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire brigade freed the occupants.
Six rescue cars and one emergency car arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a bus to the town of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the trucker and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water will be EUR 3.44 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl waste water treatment plant from 1 October 2016 instead of EUR 2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp EUR 3.36 (up to EUR 2.26) and for Azendorf EUR 3.64 (up to EUR 2.18).
At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After over-calculating, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, under the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, there were under-covers for these wastewater treatment plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities on a cost-effective basis on the basis of legal bases.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take a deeper look at the wallet.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As indicated by the board’s director Herbert Schmidt, a recalculation of fees was necessary for the waste water facilities of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or under-coverage would also be offset from the previous calculation period.
The serious increase in fees led Schmidt to the fact that all three waste water plants were relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of waste water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Moreover, during the last calculation period, not least due to their age, renovation and repair costs had occurred to a significant extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pump plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch and the Lopp pond treatment plant had to excavate the first sewage pond after almost 20 years of operation, dispose of sewage sludge and install an additional ventilation facility in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses have been met by the continued maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still significantly below the current level.
Stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water attack in the three plants, the costs of operation and maintenance "are fully passed on".
Schmidt added that the market community had been spared from large entertainment costs in wastewater treatment plants over the past 20 years.
In the view of Steinhäuser, the situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the long term, since the supply area of the waste water destination association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended to include these plants because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first one over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation rate of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %, measured by the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that it is absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, property distorting tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past, in which they were accused that the Blackface app would promote or white skin as a beauty ideal.
This week when some users proposed a filter that gave them a sloth, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injuringly and calmly unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural obstacle wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are more diverse in racial matters than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, calling on others to do the same.
In an essay for medium and in a phone interview she said that she believes that race-related controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the mostly white, male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"either they have no different representation of people with different skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company has recently appointed a human resources manager to focus on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on her part, said that she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military management falsifies ISIS intelligence information, notes Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and in Syria when it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground, a Congress Committee of Inquiry reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their views on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Nachrichtendienstinformation, which was typically abducted by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership errors in Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts were subjected to pressure from their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than they correspond to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans brought the Task Force to life after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations continue.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence are under way.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democracy in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff representative house, in a statement.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "suffered the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morals among analysts and "gave excessive space for dissenting opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had found no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who was admitted after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress reports while the Inspector General's investigations were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have repercussions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that has been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations made last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of uncertainties over ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small crew force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebelling against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that, contrary to government statements, air strikes against the Islamic state's refineries would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries had started to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is ahead
One day, after shooting three goals over Japan during a 6-1 win, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea." she said.
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two within their group will win six teams each first and second place.
The first-placed will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer away from the other group.
Whatever the game may be on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 seats.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at three years had a hockey bat in her hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and thus began to turn things around for the better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We did not have the working money in London that we now have.
We've been able to pull the rudder all the way around.
On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backlash from the nearby area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team appeared surprisingly tough and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, then pulled into the middle and slipped the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to book a goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging season between competition and striving.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning staff, which is handed by the arm's chest protector to the swimmer to the gymnast.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop waiting line, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is present at the Olympic Games for the first time and is a female black with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournaments.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast-swimming and may long rule it.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so scarcely seen in the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians that for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like shaking of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of the turn and diving, the two sports which it essentially unites.
The word "trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "jumpboard."
Strenuous victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to make a series of falling movements (threws, hedges and salttos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program by performance, difficulty and "flight time".
Two-and-a-half athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will fight each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medalhoffende must continue in their quest for gold, faster, go up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
Not only do they pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but they also pursue another high-end goal in television broadcasting: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to touch even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel myself when watching these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breather.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she blows off, apparently unhesitating like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
There is also competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general Tumult.
If the raising of awareness can only be achieved by the adjournment and objectification of male athletes - as suggested recently by the male U.S. Turners according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air-circling, new convict.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia just collapsing?
In the last ten years it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and have spread into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's response was merciless.
Witnesses reported that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video on the protests that are probably from the last year or the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia, according to Nigeria, is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have consistently led the government to oppress - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed or driven to the vast desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth protests.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this delicate, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit and rearm turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of simmering under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government stops access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered for protests in this way.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and the economy, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that too is changing.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who make up around 6 percent of the population and who dominate the military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was viewed as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly interested in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The present regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, were apparently abused by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the past months and this time of unrest went by relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the Ethiopian government's internal disfavor.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, attacked Tigray's business, and hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratification."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensiblely with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters who try to protect him during an eventful phase into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After he made the point at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism plows down on Mr. Trump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign on falling survey values to the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I meant that sarcasticly".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries of politics and then to row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear up" depending on how the reaction turns out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of discontinuing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more edifying tone, as his survey values have decreased further.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a tour with great head start in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal fellow fighters into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backboners, completely wrong and that is why he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that under Obama, where Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the government allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats scoffed at Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once the price is pushed out of the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shrewd café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifiing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new invention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, who owns and manages the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things going.
Verb uses the same distributor for the Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sautéed onions.
There are nature travel bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also pushed out of Williamsburg by prizes," he said.
Recently on one Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and at the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and invariably always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepared my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-Bagel with bacon, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't care about the soap business taking over the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verbs with the cold-brown coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to come up with her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to show it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juice room would like to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a progenitor and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like returning home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a taster, President Roosevelt had a feature for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato paste and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing house on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Stock Exchange crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with potato paste and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered the hackbread, this couple found it appropriate to discuss the food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and beans bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that extends the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastés were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country was dealing with not being the Slaraffe land anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense theme for the Americans," Coe welcomed why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally tense: secretive foods such as bread and cashier's rolls became basic foods, the cashier's role as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetising ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rare-served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy food.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical of many of the household economic recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - promoted the country's eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and the challenge of turning pompoms like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was feeding like the millionaire man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully different from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most consolingly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple stated that they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother - in - law, for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.
Ziegelman remembered: "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunchtime.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a discount three times.
Like a can-do pet he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the image magazine, has saved almost 60,000 lives so far.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to drag people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video by the civil protector, showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, said, "For me, this is the real Jihad."
"When I die saving life, I think God sees within me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from respiratory distress.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime's deadly bomb had to strike terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get young at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims comfortably along the bottom of the North Atlantic, reaching an average of just 1,220 metres in an hour.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to full 2.6 km/h - and at this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this life-style of slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the Eismeer off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Fahrenheit [6 ° C], they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their time-lapse rate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
However, these sharks make prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another one swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the ice-cream and looking for cadavers that are drying down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland sharks, which fishers caught before Greenland or Spitzbergen as by-catches from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the shark’s lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is already formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not later renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear tests carried out more radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
The lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests in the 220 centimeters in length, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in its 2012 investigation.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland shark, the carbon 14 hour showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark at 502 centimeters should be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of multiplication.
This too is likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methuselahs live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale in whose bacon was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a spar flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible early," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in a double pack
The municipal council has focused on issues relating to construction in the recent session.
With ease, the board took up the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can finally begin".
After the land, parceling and development questions were clarified and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straße" and "Schönau-West" (Bereich Binderstraße - Ausbauschnitt 1) to interested persons is nothing further in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and noisy seniors alike.
As it was called, construction volunteers can report immediately at the town hall, on the allocation of parcels the municipal council is expected to advise in its September session.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other commercial establishments linked to the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the land use plan in sub-areas, which was only newly established in the spring of this year.
In the field of underzeitlarn, the commercial area already designated there is extended by two plots towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city of Main thus has the best chance of attracting out of London out of jobs and companies.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's Finance Markets and Real Estate Markets competence field.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial activities throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been admitted to Great Britain.
It's using big U.S. banks.
Several banks have already announced that they will move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg has a large fund sector but, like Dublin, it is worse off in infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city points with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not that easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtlander.
In the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than in the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the company consulting Mercer, the city ranked seven, Luxembourg ranked 19, Dublin ranked 33, and Paris ranked 37th.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," says the IW.
London, however, will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit.
The conditions of power also speak for this: According to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 14400 people worked in the banking industry, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million damages payment for the violation of two Merck patents that were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior by Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was brought on Thursday, U.S. U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued for each other and claimed property for laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s medications.
United States-backed troops say they have regained complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
United States-backed troops have taken full control of the northern city of Manbij back near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a spokesman of the group on Friday.
Syria's Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently fighting through the city after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish announced the Manbij military council of Reuters allied with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we're just doing clean-up work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published their 2015 tax statement on Friday, which gave the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former Foreign Minister gave a USD 3 million income from publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published his tax returns for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to set standards on financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In a sharp contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not obliged by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," wrote Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special advisor, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax audits are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business gestures and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and released on Friday a video on the Internet in which high-ranking Republican Trump invites him to publish his tax return.
On Thursday she also addressed the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has its headquarters, called for Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said that he had also been subject to a tax assessment by the IRS and Trump had "anxious" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns downwards by 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of around 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax declaration of 2015 showed that it received only USD 100 of its income as a wage, unlike the majority of Americans.
Its main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109.000 were taxed.

condoms with chilipuds, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Natureguards in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to prevent elephants from going to inhabited settlements by humans - they throw condoms at them that are filled with chilipuds.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has, together with US nature protection, intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-tier method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts into the air with a bang and sprays fine dust into the air.
A hint is usually already out to chase away the elephants.
One last option is a thrower who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No kiosk building on the St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, St. Goarer takes investment projects from traders with kissing hands - but especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the building.
"In principle, we welcome new commercial operators, but this kiosk is not suitable for this location in an exposed location on the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU faction.
Jewish director smashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-election was removed according to "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he had betrayed the fact that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-election, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" left his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country pre-election list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinxi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was an "intentional decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason behind this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-selection be deleted," Lanzmann quoted the employee.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and disturbed by this event.
This is really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has occurred in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even more disgraceful.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "submitted" the alleged calls made by Arab guests.
"Pity you," it said in another article, pointing out that the hotel, located at the noble Electoral Dam, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident a "accident" and "excused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not include in the fast dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country pre-election has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
On Thursday, students in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo met with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffiti against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after protesters in crowds went on the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly, the Ambassador informed.
Russian companies establish existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports into Iran rose by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The rise in trade was achieved by the delivery of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Office issued some 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that monuments of ancient Persian civilization have been preserved in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses Wanted: Drinking market in Waldbroel
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening on Rewe XXL's beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With the help of a gun, three dark-dressed people who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the drink market employee and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't tell.
The perpetrators should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters in size, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the rewe market and cannot be seen easily.
After the attack, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking entrance with the silver car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (at 7:45 p.m.) related to the robbery should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days were spent by the children and young people of the social educational group/social group work of the Children's Protection Association Nagold with their attendants during their summer leisure time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet leisure home Hardtwäddle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to boards with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand, after Maulbronn, where there was a special child tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celt Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which invited them to jump, swim and plan.
Culinary children and carers were spoiled with their own prepared body dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bologna.
In workshops, beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Colorful Night".
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home happy.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministrants from the Seelsorgeunit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in expected two years, St. Anna's High Ministerial Round decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg's Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made their way.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim cross and gave the pilgrim victory.
From Horb it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a Münster of Our Lady and the pilgrimage of the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed each morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
On the way, however, the minis of field cruises, chapels or churches continued to relax in order to sing together a song of a specially composed pilgrim song.
For the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we passed through Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
On the next day, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to go down about 500 metres above sea level at high heat and then climb again.
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pool in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, the final stage was to Freiburg.
Visiblely relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg's Münster in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.
After the worship, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristy and the High altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Shooter Callum Skinner storms home when Brite gets gold for cycling
Schottlands Callum Skinner spent the last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, defending the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor roll that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy spund made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March, despite Hoys' resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when hinds appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman who has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was almost back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy was a major part of the transformation in which Hinds went into a higher gear to slow him down and to enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and came up with skinners, Kenny and Hindes as they got on the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph at Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track deliberately after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags."
We've been together for the last three months as a team.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form Kennys it is possible that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medallion competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51,942.
The 2012 world record was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the beekeeper, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had fought yesterday with officers before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong rail bike team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and bullying as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary call of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of Portland’s melting process due to the termination of the Energy Treaty questionable
The future of Portland's aluminium meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and will thus terminate all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake in the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's melting plant in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation as to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company announced.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong forward markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual contract amounting to $187 million in "expectation of termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts did not affect "the ability of Alcoas to operate the melting industry or to ensure the power supply to the melting industry".
The US company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it still owes a statement why it has resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity each year and about 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would significantly reduce demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who ran on the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover's revelation followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's problems, and in the presence of the world's most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-like act of almost every birthday episode of a child show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a station at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her as to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a range that resembles a picture tape rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, out of the 832 pages of the Walter 615 pages were advertising).
The disclosure of his coverstars is expected to be so longing that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine have been leaking before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has been clearly more "famous models" than "models that are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar Award Winner and Dior Brand Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even at the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the former Victoria's Secret Model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out on the Vogue Cover with the publication of Jenners.
But to ride around on the malignment seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your prime of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her spare time she's on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and their children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people every year
More than 160,000 of the country's most needy people are rejected by the municipal law centres each year, while the sector is affected by the impact of further austerity cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, helpless workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unjust delegating and the like - are already denied access to free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already over-exploited, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The Director of the Common Rights Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without an end to the federal government's decision.
"Queensland Municipal Law Centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their client communities and that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inaction after she was informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to an employee in February, while they were on their way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini stated to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "took a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and hit the run in Vincent's kneecap," Bordini filed in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four more people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the prosecution.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to do harm," said Bordini.
The charge only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment people" - gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be appointed.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of context and that he would not be incited to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesperson Hope Hicks was unable to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, have not been responded to.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign so far.
The trial is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey for Country Elections: SPD and CDU Lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Picture" magazine (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could only continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only just in front of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent in the Landtag for the first time.
Despite slight losses, the Greens reintroduce into the Schweriner Landtag with 6 percent (preceding 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be present at 3 per cent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move in in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and internet in time loop: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they kind of come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair Cebit in Hanover as "office in the western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the Communicator to reach.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, though painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded up similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
Nobody in August 1996 could imagine that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finns' cellphone sector experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold and handled to Microsoft.
Today, the market dominates providers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online all the time and everywhere, that's for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, while Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
An entire industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market only came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use by touch screen.
Apple's winning move started, and today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who controlled the market, had the regrets.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The sayings now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn how to remove the smartphone, too," Janina Kugel said, in the Siemens Executive Board, responsible for personnel.
Permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the greatest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new teaching posts, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blam on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth and a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which five years in a row was chosen as the world's best airport terminal, to the T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequent running stages in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third run, which is supported by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" regarding ad block
According to one of the software manufacturers, for companies that earn money with online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blockage are similar to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ads on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding regarding its ads to make it hard to detect ad blockades about which part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams spokesperson wrote that "this kind of back-and-up fight between the advertising blocking Open Source Community and the surrounding community has been going on since the invention of ad blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people use ad blockers; almost four times as many in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has it aside on ad blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficient proportion of revenue, so Facebook’s investment of such a step appears to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preference tool" in order to have more control over people's advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a Facebook spokesperson in an e-mail message.
Ad blockers are a mute tool, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
In case of suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday was hit by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who are asking these as well as every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a clash avoidable?
This is something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian was running on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policeman was acquitted of the negligent killing after she had overtaken and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus might have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly turned around.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more matte.
"In the Giss model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said Giss scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although it was once probably habitable, Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen left, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations, leading to a lack of co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
I have been thinking for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, it needs it and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
It must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sak.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches in 2013-14, Roy was the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points back.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Resume Talks, Break Strike
The labour struggles concerning the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are being put on hold, while all the parties are taking a new round of talks, said the negotiators.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to relaunch the settlement process of the current dispute," states a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year in order to tackle the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group reduced the rates of its North Sea contractors by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rating is followed by a 10% decrease for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell has abandoned thousands of people for its part and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lower rate of raw materials travel, an economic situation which was exacerbated by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in one statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion of expenditure is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the cluster of Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates in star clusters and in what connection the rotational periods are with the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars that emerged some 125 million years ago are now reaching adulthood.
Now they're spinning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of starwinds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
As the star cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.
"The cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to speak hang their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional against Tampa Bay Rays will last wear the jersey of his New York Yankees on August 12th.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was selected three times as the most valuable player of the league, and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will continue to act as a consultant and youth coach - at full pay.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and the Yankees since 2005 he made several milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the baseball hall.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted at "ESPN" to have taken on banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have received performance support through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a dispute, the barrier was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said Süffisant at the time.
Even his farewell days don't run smoothly.
While many baseball legends in their last games once again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job includes trying to win every game," Yankees coach Joe Girardi ate.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathies from the fans of the Yankee-Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping sample Adrian Zielinski should not start weightlifter from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the race, the first official doping events were announced at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre dog runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically sighted athletics competitions, these news are untimely.
At Chen last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had won the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminaries of over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B test and for a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will work with the International Sports Court and accept the verdict".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news of the positive test at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," said the athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive three days earlier like his brother Tomasz on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The world association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian team to launch, except for one exception due to systematic dopings, also the running Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the past crimes in China had also caused fierce conflicts between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang Pinkelt purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also the focal point of an engagement with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," he said.
Sun had been tested positive on the stimulation trimetazidine in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but only had to remove a three-month barrier.
Datenklau: So perfide blackmail hackers their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey of malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past twelve months, partially multiple victims of a blackmailing software attack.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already targeted by a Ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to re-use the affected systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorting ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching a horrifyingly fast evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Only private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks has taken place horrifyingly quickly in recent months.
Ransomware works on a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the extortioners.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
However, where private users are at risk of the personal photo database, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Accordingly, higher damage occurs when a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported revenue losses from Ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, many hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients may be in acute danger from the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims, 'Don't pay, you only promote the problem,' explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in view of the downtime in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the extortioners and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via bitcoin, set up free-access support websites, or decrypt example files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partially negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and sharing the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a Ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual extortioners.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then seek more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals usually then order spammers to spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to prevent Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful feeding, the perpetrators threaten instead to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is still much higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals on the Internet of Things.
At the hacker conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could gain control of a thermostat connected to the Internet.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overcharged, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it doesn't seem in any place close.
The materials of the interior are well processed and seem pleasant, only the cockpit top falls slightly off.
More versatile than comparable vehicles, the HR-V is in storage.
Not only is there a trunk space of 453 l available for raised and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be well loaded, but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should, however, do his work a little less slowly.
Happy is the daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petrol with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
One of the safety systems is the City emergency brake assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track hold assistant.
The collision warner sometimes annoys, because when he ranks many obstacles he counts as "coming objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller reacts to traffic sign recognition and threshes the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity, however, exists only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI sockets are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you do not want to invest that much, you will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14) argued that liability can only be considered in the event of risks typical of air transport.
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc at the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damages.
Disease case: When paid by the organiser
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their journey if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, on the second day of their leave in Turkey, a family was severely ill with diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Her illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant, which allegedly had polluted the seawater.
The family thought that the trip had been defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success in court.
In fact, the sewage treatment plant was defective.
However, the organizer did not find out until shortly before the plaintiff left.
He had to assume that the sea water was fine by then.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
In particular, no impurities have been found in the water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to reflect and at the same time resolutely react to terrorist threats.
Surely our land will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not condone this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this increases security and also strengthens the support of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag elections.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces "in the medium four-digit range over several years".
The promotion of sympathy for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, arms law is so new that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be observed in the words of de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk to citizens, he said with a view to, for example, mental intricacies.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke out against activism.
"This was an earpiece for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday) newspapers.
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union following a ban on Burka and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general ban on full-blowning, he considers constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You could talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of simulating force and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left Party Chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleetful sayings and a tightening of the right of residence no longer bring security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway carrier
It is regularly stowed on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this should be changed: the right turnout is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the highway towing (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Road construction will extend the right turnaround by 700 meters on next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Strasse and Weseler Strasse.
Drivers can then saddle directly from the Hammer Straße to the right.
The great advantage: the traffic is split up earlier, thus improving the overall run on the much-traveled section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts representing Münster-West.
The roadblocking on the bringer is especially annoying for drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On working days, the back-stave reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only steered in an unanswered manner over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well over a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to take on two-track traffic in particular.
How long this congestion and the associated working day congestion will last cannot be said by the competent national operator.
However, years are expected: because the bridge has an official residual period until 2034.
For the extension of the right-hand curve, the state operation has deliberately chosen the less traffic time in the school holidays because handicaps can be expected.
Traffic will be passed by the construction site on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
Intercultural Trip: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Trip" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016, including Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenes and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action nevertheless, according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languagel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association expects to participate with many classes.
Rain instead of star snooping: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the Sternschnuppen-Guckeren in the Southwest of Germany during the night on Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of stars in the sky.
The star clusters are perseidens, which are among the fastest star clusters at 26,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Recreational night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm clock rings.
It's all but relaxing.
After all, there are such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as unresponsive.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be many causes behind them, says Hans-Günter Weess, Executive Board member of the German Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine Society.
What one understands nationally, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
Many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the Board of Management at the German Hausärzteverband with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications, can be contained.
Not rarely the sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common especially with depression," says Weess.
And it may be that different factors require each other.
For example, if you have a disc incident, it can be bad, wakes up every two to three hours and may begin to grumble over everyday problems and worries, you know, gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you have trouble sleeping with your doctor?
If you do not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and are affected by the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weess.
The impairment may look quite different: one is depressed, tired, unsleeping, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and for no more than two weeks.
There is hardly any established dormant doctor in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormant centre of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Weess advises that you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who's supposed to go to the dorm, and what's going on?
For example, in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise on snoring with atemaussezers, in case of day fatigue, in case of sleep changers, or when the cause of sleep disturbance is not found, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," says Fitze.
After cabling you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a nostrils, a chest strap and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping end.
How can people affected deal with the problems?
There are quite a number of screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weess counts on: regular bedtime and bedtime, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV to sleep, not avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite not conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing cutting off of the DSV team at Olympics.
In December 2014, he had won the Shortway World Championships in Doha for the first time and recorded his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up to protect himself from his former teammates in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ prize and a jungle king 150,000€ nobody should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night.
The conveyor system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at it as closely as possible or even operate it on the subject of doping.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
This is the same with countries.
"Any person who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain period of time prior to the WM/OS must not be allowed to participate," asks the hamburger, who now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: Bands of Baggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, two women and two men between 50 and 61 years of age were arrested by the Düsseldorf police.
As a gang, the suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts.
At 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the police from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had done so jointly, professionally and professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove to the thieves who had come to Germany specifically for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had taken a total of more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few Lindenbäumchen, in between still a remnant of cobblestone pavements: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem that way at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the street from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a organic shop.
To the facade of a gray house someone sprayed "hateful!"
Compared to a lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
In recent weeks, however, articles about this "stricken district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are best illustrated with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly spoken out for a tough action by the police against the project, calling the area a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the cadders, had been evacuated with 300 police officers on the 22nd of June, the police patrolled official statements for three weeks, stating that 30 to 40 officers and three local team cars blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown owners renovated the rooms.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the evacuation had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheer of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana, who is raising three children here, are particularly bothered by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which today also has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupations and housing projects have long been part of Kiez: in 1990 many houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainz road near Riga.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street battle under great police command, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and were partially inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and election Berliners from all over the world in recent years: with them, residents from GDR times and former homeowners share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on cast-in discs or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown with colour bags.
No other street was so often mentioned this year along with the words "left-wing autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against police.
Most of the crimes are material damage that tends to affect the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the contested 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of insecurity.
As far as violence is concerned, it is comforting: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly have not been.
Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in Riga.
For the studied architect her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
New builders have deliberately moved to Riga Street - and remained.
That's why it was so important for the locals to get back to their streets: from the police, the politics and the media, all of whom suddenly claimed the high level of interpretation about the district in July.
But in the eyes of the inhabitants like new builders, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that crowd out the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - rather, people who are not so well-informed live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: The house projects and the left scene were part of Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a pub area can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The teacher supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
It sees itself as a contact point for all actors: refugees, working group on refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that the deuschle is now there, the egg-legging wool milksau, which has a problem above all.
Thus, some - less mocking than rather the many desirable areas of responsibility - had meant that the administration wanted to write the job out.
An administrative expert was sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it concerns organization, work with people on the ground and also behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She's been on a 50-percent shift for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers are soon standing in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The costs of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find any private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, depending on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, communal apartments need to be refurbished, as they call it.
So new containers will soon be set up on the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are traineeships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help masters, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
It's "no employment therapy".
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say devil and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So here too, administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says Customer honestly, "People who are not going anywhere". The work of Deuschle and Customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mummy task".
A difficult question: Are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent incidents?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.
But the helpers were already sensitized.
These incidents were also the subject of refugees.
They're afraid that the assassins are going to bring her all the way in.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and volunteer officials on the ground and in the region have to look for activities.
They always have the background that soon a new attack on refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is spared.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on the spot.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach where we could go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already used to integrating the people before.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Intruders Seeked With Helicopter
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessful.
On Friday morning, around 8.50 p.m., two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg.
The dweller surprised the two and struck the troubles into flight.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore bluejeans and black hooded pulleys.
They fled towards the city center.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The hunt went on without success.
The unknown may have been caught near the apartment or during their escape.
