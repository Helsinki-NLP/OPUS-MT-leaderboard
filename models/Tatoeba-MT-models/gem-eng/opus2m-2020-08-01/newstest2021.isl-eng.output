Crying to the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland thinks has gone well and shouts and shouts in nature are starting to pull people wide and wide around the world.
"You own the pit, I need Iceland," said a woman in the big world, commenting on the announcement from the YouTube Stock Exchange of Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another spectator will keep Iceland in its heart forever, and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible, because her fiancé lives there.
Sadly, though, she is in the United States and expects to wait for another month.
Another spectator asks if the walk to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if it comes from another time zone.
Egill Thordarson of Peel's advertising office, which was responsible for the advertising and the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, says that receptions have been hoped for more.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to hit the record.
Basically, this is about creating a PR value, it's getting foreign media to deal with the campaign, and it's been amazingly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received a worldwide coverage of some seven hundred media, reaching over two billion people in total.
The value of this coverage is worth $1,8 billion.
It's not hard."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful, even though the Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egil, such areas as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also been well - known, as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then came reactions from foreign lands, such as India, that were not specifically planned.
“These advertisements have traveled far beyond our expectations, ” says Egill, who may have watched YouTube for more than four million people.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The pictures on the opening took place in the middle of the month in the middle of the “Let It Out ” titled the Year of Söberg, a photographer of the Morning magazine.
The roofs were wide and wide, such as in the Reykjavík School Guard, in Reynisfara, at Forest Foss, on the Solheim River, and in a cave at the Archdiocese.
The directors of the game were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson, among Scotland’s productions, and the taker of Fear of the Son of God.
In roles, there were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recordings were made in the South, there was another group in the West and West.
According to Egil, the 'Let It Out' is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is only the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office," says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ Working with them is great.
In such tasks, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets to which we are talking."
Explosives: Discuss the position on the labour market, life insurance funds, and much more
Mr Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, will be at the Exprang sand, which will begin at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also a labour market minister and discusses the position on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural affairs and transportation to land that has gone badly and that has been debated in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, president of VR, will also be present, but he will discuss his criticisms about the investment of life insurance funds, and will put forward ideas that labour mobility and professionalism will withdraw from the funds’ governments to reduce the risk of conflict of interest.
Then there will be a discussion with Ivar the son of Ingimar, a tourist in the east, and the daughter of Jahrnhei, the manager of the market place in the north, of the tourist work in the country.
They will look forward to the fall and wonder if the summer’s success is a misleading prelude to what is to come.
You can listen to the section below, starting at ten o’clock.
That's how she looks today 25 years later
The playwright Elisa Donovan had a successful career in all aspects of youth.
However, she was world famous for her game as Amber in Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
However, she was moved to look over the road and talk about Clueless on a love - inspiring television during the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I have to admit that I based the person mostly on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after the night.
About fifty cases were brought to the police ’ table in the capital area today, and the police ’ diary says that matters were varied.
The day at the police station at the neighborhood street began by a police officer who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of a drunk driving.
If the man did not want to leave after he was released, he would not obey the direction of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a continued stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested in the morning wound suspected of a break-in in a Copavogi company.
The police also had to deal with two men in the Breitholt because of reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman who was sitting at a food store in Copavogi could not pay the bill at the end of the meal, so she was called to the police.
Stealing was also reported in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a while, and she was then taken by an inexorable hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Cursedness of the Joy Party - The Horrible Destiny of the Joyful Stars
This theory has made the Internet a curse over the Joy Party series, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California on the days and became the third major actor in the show to make life long before age.
Glee is a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
These included a group of youths in high school, their love, and their fate.
It was not always taken out with the happiness of being in the party, but through singing and dancing, the characters seemed to overcome any circumstances that arose in their lives.
However, outside the scene, the players and the employees have been hit by a great deal of tragedy, so much so that theories have awakened to the curse of the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santán Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the tournament was over, Rivera went on to own Ryan Dorsey, with him his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then understood them.
However, Dorsey refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8 last, Rivera was reported missing after her four - year - old son was found alone in a boat on Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat and was able to report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stabbed himself and Rivera had brought him back into the boat, but he never returned there himself.
A major search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we had been looking for the impression that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially sentenced to death.
It is thought to have been in a heavy stream in the water, using its final insistence on saving the Son.
Cause of death was recorded as a result of an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American footballer with the angel sound, which played a key role in bringing the Joy League to justice and respect.
However, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his associates felt sufficient, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to treatment and seemed to look all the better.
Just two months after finishing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out for fun with friends.
Banamein was a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought to be a willful act.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerability to drugs had been reduced to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated was shown to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was severe on his associates, but on the basis of his rival wife, Leah Michele, they were determined to continue their activities and dedicated them to the memory of Moneith and Finn’s personality.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the play, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy League, or until until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles, where he was suspected of child pornography.
During his home search at his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and soon the matter was publicly questioned.
It was clear that Salling had finished.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his crimes.
If he had four to seven years ’ imprisonment, he would have to keep a record of sex offenders and seek treatment for childish greed.
Before the decision was made by a judge, Salling, who was then freed from insurance, was left near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just actors who fell from far before age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013, he was suddenly put to sleep, only 41 years old.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the great star Julia Roberts and did not bear the beautiful story of her sister, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, saying goodbye to her mother and to her sister, among other things, that she was responsible for how she was treated.
“My mother and so - called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow performers ’ bullying and passing on to the scene and of having an abundance of astrology.
Jesse Luke played a guest role in the 2012 show.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was a major stumbling block.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, she suffered from the use of nude pictures by impostors on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had a love affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had used violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything.
It increases the maturity of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just spending time with the children in the park is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Purchased a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we are many seamen who work in the country's playgrounds," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, who is fishing on a beach in the summer but takes psychology at Iceland's University of Winter."
Sea fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have good income, and I think it’s great that you can let go of a study loan.
The incomes are also good enough for me in the winter," says Axel Eagle Gudmundsson, 25-year-old psychologist, who is fishing on the beach in summer as in the past summer.
Axel was the newest to dock at Talknavärd, when a journalist reached him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The tenth grade of my life, I took ship management privileges for boats less than six feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after finishing primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann the son of Jon, and I named the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," said Axel, adding that he had bought the boat in three million.
“ I signed a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I was caught.
So at the end of my first summer, I had the boat innocent."
How, though, could a boy have one and a half million to pay in a boat when he had just finished elementary school?
“I had laid down and collected money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I was all fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my square money in my boat fund."
Axel was born on Isafirður, from where all his mother's people are, but he has lived in Copavogi since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the West because I have a law residence with my grandmother at Isafjord.
I learned in this area west of a row with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, for this fishing area covers all the West.
Although I feel best to be on the west side, I have also been around Snowflakes and other places.
"I've also given south, but then preferably a gray drop," said Axel, who always beats one early fire in the morning and says sometimes talking to the seagulls and singing to the sky, in solitary hours out on the promontory.
“ The Internet on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to TV and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on a boat.
Of course, I try not to get into danger, but certainly something has been wrong occasionally, but never much danger," said Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes on every time.
“ I’ve never been fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the charter, but then I’ve been fishing for about a day and a half in the bait of the sea. ”
The beach fishing arrangement says he is such that he can hunt 70 pounds [770 kg] a day, which he feels is a hindrance.
“ Other restrictions are that I cannot hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting days by weather and nothing else.
Instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose by heart, these unnecessary pressures are to be calmed.
So the division of areas could also be done for me, and a television lock that is well located at the fishing grounds should enjoy it," says Axel, who, while drawing most of the cod from the salty seas on his shores, but also only the quirks and some other species of river with it.
Axel is a winter student at Nupi School in Copavogi.
“I don’t think we’re many sailors who work in the country’s playgrounds,” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only going to work temporarily at the playground.
“ I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will benefit me in the future, ” says Axel, who is also a longtime student in business studies.
An error occurred while registering against a homecoming alert.
An error in a registration form that people fill in when they come to the country resulted in a person living in this country not being reclaimed in a sample.
If you fill in the form in English, you do not need to type in the id number.
"This will be checked this week," says a geologist in the field of land medicine.
Three domestic infections were detected in the Department of Virology of the Land Hospital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the land on July 15, two days after the application of so - called home - comer protection rules.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened when they come to the country and again announced in a sample four to five days later.
On the other hand, it was stated in the RUV’s lunch news that the subject had followed the old system.
The cross - border display was negative, and it was not recalled in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of land medicine, says in a conversation with a newsroom that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic record sheet.
If people fill in the registration form in English, they are not required to put in a national identification number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
In the end, it was primarily thought of by foreign tourists.
Therefore, the individual has not been automatically invited to show.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed home - gate rules, although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to return samples after returning to the country.
“This will be examined during the week how to make it easier for people to access it to draw attention to it in the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement, and six have been infected.
They're all on the show, but two of them were starting to show signs.
Infection is now taking place with the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is largely due to two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, an analysis of Icelandic genotyping has shown that there are variants of the coronal virus that have not been previously detected.
In the second case, the bond has been directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who transported the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be there tomorrow when the other virus would come.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID site.
135 are sick.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic seizures have been detected here in recent days.
Of these, four are unrelated and have not been identified as the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup yesterday.
Infection is still present.
Originally, in the third century C.E., the number of sick people was reduced to 16.
A total of 34 sufferers are diagnosed yesterday because of these new infections.
This is the second brief time that infection is detected during sporting events and has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Jonsson, a communications manager at the Department of Public Affairs, says it is slow, as long as people follow criteria and rules.
“We are constantly drawing attention to all those who live here who need to maintain personal protection.
We also need to impress on people who are holding events that there are rules in place that need to be observed.
"Then you can have an event," says John.
He says that the prevention of infection can be achieved by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
In addition, rules and standards are under constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Health and National Medicine are constantly intriguing people, is to take into account these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and also at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says John.
“We need to press on with the good road we were on, so that we can maintain the results we have achieved here.”
40% COVID-19 Victims had Diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was going to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronary virus infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen.
The Reuters News Force is not saying fear of Brumfield for no reason.
The numbers of new studies conducted by the U.S. authorities show that almost 40% of those who have died had diabetes 2 as a underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is assessed, the proportion increases to half.
A study of the U.S. Disease Control (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died of the coronary virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says that the results are positive, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuter’s slow growth was hidden and the answers from the 12 countries that corresponded to a comparable proportion.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now the COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful century," says Reuters, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also gone worse out of the chronic virus.
One of the best protections for people with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with exercise, diet and healthcare professionals.
However, the coronary virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
Then a high price of insulin has forced some to continue to come to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that diabetes 2 sufferers may be exposed to.
When the SARS coronal virus passed over in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the 2009 swine flu epidemic, this group was at three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS was reported in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could have been longer, the epidemic has eliminated the cover of many previously unknown complications.
“ I’m afraid we’ll see a wave of problems when it’s over, ” says Andrew Bolton, Chairman of the International Association of Diabetes Diseases.
Physicians have warned that the coronical viral epidemic may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the coronary virus may lead to an increase in diabetic cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the coronary virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, organs that are already ill in many people with diabetes.
In this way, a high percentage of glucose and lipid in diabetics can produce a true “cell - signalling storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells may also lead to inflammatory formation, which in turn may cause fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected to each other."
The story has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, so they left the room."
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason made the unusual request from the artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting on in Paris.
"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets that when he first met his wife and mother, Ásruna Magnúsdód.
“ I was very impressed by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then I thought it was totally unheard of.
And still likes," he says.
Ásrún also remembers the end of his first meeting regularly.
“I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend alone," said she, who was also attracted to the husband at first sight.
“I found and find so much excitement around Atla, whom I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I was fascinated by it."
Atli says that he and his wife have stressed the importance of their own way.
“We don’t tie our shoulders to the same knots as our companions.
We avoid routines around us."
That is possible reason why they took the initiative of Ragnari Kjartan’s son, an artist, only to rejoice, even though it was most mildly unusual.
“Christine Anna, our common friend, will contact us and ask if we can come and eat dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg of Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps, and had desserts and desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans to perform the artwork he intended to install in Paris’s Palais de Tokyo in the fall.
“He had a multiplicity of videotapes called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way."
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent later from the everyday lives of the Western people.
“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
The senane that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show a young middle class couple to love in a minimalist room.
"It's intercourse with the beginning and the end," said Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much, even though they knew about him, and he did “but they knew us and found us fitting in.
They said that they did not want to advertise people.
They may have thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sexual abuse from performing for others."
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to think the matter over, but it did not take long.
“ When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Aren’t we just ready for this? ’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," said Ásrún and Atli.
"It's about love and closeness"
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment on the Myrene Strait.
There was a very small film studio; a cameraman, Ragnar, and a musician; and the couple.
After the recording had been started, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We haven’t decided what we should be like.
We received some advice, but we tried to forget about time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," said Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a little romantic," said Atli and Ásrún.
“We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the couple’s performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi took a look at this, he cried, and he thought it was so beautiful," said Atli.
“This is about love and closeness as it is about relationships,” says Ásrún.
The parents of the couple have seen the work, telling Atli that his mother heard the voice in the Son of the Art Gallery of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to think about it," says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone this way, but then Dad just sent me a message and said, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," recalls Ásrún.
And do you think that participation in the work deepened the relationship between Ásru and Atla?
“ At least we’re still together, so maybe it got deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with the in-law family," said Ásrún and laughed.
Ásrún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says and turns to her husband.
“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one inch in a much bigger job, and when you see it with the other functions, it’s really cool.
I was able to tear myself apart a little and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," said Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the couple's children when the tendon was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to the Africans and Atla in Ássäger, on the 1st Channel.
Swansea wins the first springboard game
Swansea won a 1-0 win at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the team in the first round of the game to get into the English elite.
The game took place at Swansea, Wales.
Half the game was 0-0.
At 64 minutes, Swansea’s homes were given hell, while Andre Ayew broke his bow from the white spot and was protected.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, player Brentford, received the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game less, and in 82 minutes, Swansea’s players took advantage of the distinction.
Andre Ayew improved the whiskers by scored a great goal and won Swansea 1–0.
Thus, Swansea leads 1–0 in the final round, but the second game takes place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Sentinel-free for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he feared his life.
However, it has not been easy for the president of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst’s resignation from the U.S. ambassador’s office at the end of April 2009, the country has had no ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under special circumstances, but Kastlys reported in 2009 that she should have received the False Words.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the president’s office saying that she would not be honored.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst’s successor, in September 2010.
In some respects it may be that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but he did not.
At last, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign service for decades.
He then left office in the fall of 2013 and took up the position of ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassador - free period took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and joined shortly thereafter, when no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was appointed politically, but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign fund.
He left office as soon as Donald Trump took office on the President’s Office, January 20, 2017, as is the custom of having a political ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high - ranking officials in the Washington system.
Hence, two years passed before U.S. Congress announced to Jeffrey Ross Gunter that he would ask him out and confirm that he was an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at Congress he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter, a former California dermatologist, has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republican Jewish Coalition, is a political order.
The gambling owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is an avid supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s government was to appoint key officials and that the last few years the U.S. Congress has been very slow, including the confirmation of an ambassador’s office.
Since 2009, therefore, Iceland has been an unenvoyed country for more than five years.
However, this has not prevented the efforts of the embassy that recently opened a headquarters at Engetteig.
These are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the knee-thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security, for he is said to fear his life and has wished for an armed bodyguard.
The former player IBV suffered from racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, said that he had become a racist when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to the country.
This is shown in an interview with Tonny on the Ugandan Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team, which plays in Uganda’s top division.
During the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talked about many things, including his time here on land, but he played with IBV, Val and Trend in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to.
The team's captain was in that position, but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted so I didn't get either of what I wanted," said Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is a rage he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when playing in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what it was about.
He told me then that my adversary had made me fall by the wayside after I struck him."
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he claims to have made the most of his regrets.
Tonny had not managed to get on the Haugesund team, but he wanted to play more to get on the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined Val.
“ Lending back to Iceland was a mistake.
I think that if I had been in Norway longer then I would have had the opportunity I wanted," said Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He'd like to say that the loan to Iceland ended up with his dreams of getting on the big team in Europe.
Find a worm in the neck of a woman
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-bit black worm in the neck of a woman looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out with a plier.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashim, which is a thin slice of meat.
The woman soon recovered from the removal of the worm, but such parasites are often found in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi settled in the West, parasites have increased in number.
Fear of another wave emerging in Europe
Spain is now on the verge of worrying about another wave of coronary virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to halt the spread of the coronary virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infection is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken measures to increase the spread of infection in Spain, but in Britain everyone has to go to prison at the time of their return from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned about travel to Spain.
AIDS is also spreading again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between controlling the spread of the virus and reintroducing the economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good in other parts of the world, but the frequency of global transmission is approaching 300 000 a day, which is the largest in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University's opinion, confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide and are confirmed to be related to the virus at 644 thousand.
At last, Moses ’ works will enjoy themselves to the full
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
There are orange helmets on top of it.
There's a big grave there, too.
And more of my work machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
However, the walkway is capable, and many people now stop and respect the works of millions of Mosque tiles — as if they had never seen them before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it didn't matter.
The work has been hidden to date, directly in front of a parking lot that was always under siege.
People parked there, locked the car in a fast - paced hurry, and then jumped to the city center.
'Live and diverse public spaces' and 'attractive urban attractions' are a guiding principle for the reconstruction of the existing Security Road.
The goal is to decorate the area and to allow a more spectacular view of the temple’s holy daughter of Gertti.
In front of the job there will be squares and, where the area is well located at the sun, it is considered suitable as a sleeping area for pedestrians.
The work of art will be illuminated, and the material wood will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 - square - foot [142 sq m] surface.
In the area, there will also be small “foam sprayers, ” some water sculptures, which offer a game and give a certain mystery to the area.
In this way, the refunds are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is being carried out with the Witnesses.
The stream of water, heat, and electricity will be refurbished.
Many of them have reached their age, but school plazas and cold water systems dates back to 1925 and have thus served residents and businesses in the city center in less than a century.
Once the street is reopened after the works have been completed, cars can drive it back.
However, it will become a single street, and at the same time, it will create quieter and more accessible spaces for the passing.
In a study of the Toll House on the Toll Manager’s website, the house was used in 1971, an architect named Gísli Halldorsson.
Because port damage penetrated the house, 250 square feet [250 sq m] of windowless wall surfaces were formed to the street.
Building committees and architects agreed that if no special arrangements were made to adorn the appearance of the house, such surfaces would have a negative effect on the overall picture.
Thus, people agreed to calculate by having permanent works of art set up there.
At that time, a great deal of words came from the artist, Gerd Helgadddóttir.
She had worked hard on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to compete.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect life at the port, since the harbor had been a life - threatening Reykjavík since its creation.
When talking to the artist, she became obsessed with such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work abroad with the suggestions.
Gerd was given the time she would need, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
Immediately, she was accepted to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was desirable to make a complete agreement with her and the famous art firm in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerdur had long worked with them to set up famous works of art in many parts of Europe.
The work of art was done by Gerd in the workshop of the brothers, who then arranged for the installation of the Temple.
All the work was outstandingly well done, both by Gerdher Her daughter and by Oidtman’s brothers, says in the summary.
Ever since, it has been able to withstand unbridled Icelandic weather.
It took him about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.
Two years after the customs work was completed, the artist died, only 47 years old.
Preparing to move more organisations to the country
A social minister named Einar Dadason announces that more public institutions will be transferred to the country in the near future.
This was said by a minister on the Explosive at the Wave at noon.
It has recently been reported that the fire department of the National Institute of Housing and Civil Engineering will be moved north of the end of the year.
Six fire experts work at the Agency, none of which are expected to follow the Northern Institute and have critically criticised the migration of live animals by the Federal Association of Fire Departments and Medical Workers.
“I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing another step in this creature.
"More transport," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions throughout the country, he is convinced.
“I think it’s necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of public works to land, as I was doing with the National Institute for Housing and Human Resources,” said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to land and were of great importance to communities on land, such as the transport of food agencies to Selfoss, Iceland’s surveyors to Akranes, and unemployment insurance companies on Skagastrand.
All the most important from the second day of the Championship
94. Iceland's World Cup for free sports ended today at Thorsvelli in Akureyri.
A few matches were held on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition was calculated in the battle of women in Thorsvelli, while Vigdi's daughter Jonsdóttir from FH put Icelandsmet in a sleigh strike in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from the IR improved in May last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandes' record back earlier this summer and has been a fan of late, but she has tripled Iceland's summer record.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injury and has failed to reach her goal today.
She had only one valid roll of five, throwing a 20 - foot [25.69 m], which is far from her best.
Vigdis threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 meters [60,08 meters] in her last attempt, and at the same time he made a convention.
Her Iceland record she put earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was quite from it.
Dr. Karitas Hallgrímsdóttir of the IR had the second best strike of the day, but she improved her best success with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In a men's league, FH Hilmar Örn Jonsson, an Icelandic seaman in a strike, won a sure victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next pitch and set a countermeasure.
His Iceland record in this article is 75.26 meters.
God Valur Gudnason, the Olympics and the Iceland Methics in a roundabout, won a race on a swirl at Thorsveld yesterday, but today he competed in a roundcast, which is his main feature.
Val’s Iceland’s record is 65,53 meters, but he threw a maximum of 59.13 meters today and won the victory.
Valdimar Hjaldi Erlendsson threw the second longest one today, with one valid second - seat pitch, 50 feet [49.43 m].
Hafdi's Victory Daughter, Iceland's long-hauled seaman, won the long-haul competition with excellence, but Hafdi's jumped a maximum of 625 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In the 200-metre run of women, it was the IR Gudbjörg Jona Bjarnadfóttir who was the fastest but she scored in 24.04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Godbjörg Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, who won two gold medals yesterday, 100 yards [100 m] in race, and 4 x 100 meters [100 m] in race, and then also 4 x 400 meters [400 m] in race today.
In a group of men, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish in the 200 - foot [200 m] race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the son of Oliver Möna Samuel from Ármann.
Like Godbjörg Jonah, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in 100 yards yesterday as well as in the 400 - foot [400 m] race.
Don't get a ticket for $27 million Bitcoin crop.
The overtax committee has rejected the tax research director’s claim that a fine be imposed on you for misappropriating the financial resources that had been made for the sale of the electricity coin Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not given clear reasons for the need to fine the man.
The Committee’s ruling states that the tax investigator considered that the person had a place of materially incorrect tax advances for the 2016 and 2017 financial years.
He would have misrepresented his financial resources, which would have been generated by the sale of the electricity coin Bitcoin to 27 million, either on purpose or by great negligence.
The man is guilty for his conduct.
So the man rejected the letter to the committee.
In 2016, however, he continued selling electric coins for 27 million.
She would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been easy and expensive with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electric coins, tax revenue from such sales was very vague and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such arrangements for tax returns.
He would not have avoided paying a tax on the harvest and would have realized that his property was due to a tax bill.
He would have asked both experts and governors about the way things were going but without success.
Then he thought he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have made clear.
Thus, the man correctly thought that his taxes for those two years of income would be redetermined and strained, but otherwise no punishment would be made.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes here on land since 2012.
He would never have done away with his duties improperly.
The requirement for a fine would be of the utmost importance and would bring him into debt.
"This man understands what football is"
Brynjörf Andersen Willumsson has been widely intertwined with the teeth of people, but also impressed by the progress of his playtime in Pepsi Max.
Blitzes will be on the fire line tonight when they receive IA on live broadcast at Station 2 Sport.
Then, because of four reminders during the season, a Iron Santa does not play with a new clipping, as in the summer games until now.
He had written "bla, blah, blah" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was more likely to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was anyone going to equal this game then I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benedictsson in Pepsi Max's chair, when it was counted to Brennelf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ It’s hard sometimes to figure out where he is.
He looks out a little to the left when it starts to suffer the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Haflattenson.
Thorkell Mona Petersson says Brynjölf’s real amusement, and he rejoices to have such a colorful person in the department: “No one argues that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and being always ready to come and answer in interviews.
There's an incredible amount of people busy with him who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I’m an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjölf, people are paying in and watching what happens next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
The player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in touch with a few B team"
Tobias Thomsen, KR player in Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Soccer.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his native country, but to do so, he first has to cancel his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic probability.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and have shown a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with a few members of the B division and will probably switch over before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many people in Denmark who can afford to pay up my contract with KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to cope with a downturn in Denmark.
“Danish partners have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than they have in Iceland.”
The Wanderer Bjartmar has recovered a wheel for millions - Answers for himself after DV coverage
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson’s interests differed from those of most others.
He smells and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and bags.
As a result, Bjartmar has won the name “the wheelwright. ”
Yesterday, when you published an account of your dealings with Bjartmar, there was a great deal of futility.
Then DV referred them to the Facebook group of Westerners, where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to the east and said that his purse might have been stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electrician but that Bjartmar taught him to be a thief.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and the title of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar’s original news of the case does not describe what really happened yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said that he had been told by the victims that they were really his electric bats.
The information was given to the alleged owner by others, but the information proved to be wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I looked at the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, because there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him getting ready to drive on the shuttle, I decided to go and talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go into such a matter very nicely, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken off me."
Bjartmar says that the man in the electric car had likewise invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police themselves.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the battery proved his ownership of the battery and drove.
Later, as reported in the previous report, the owner of the electronic camera told about his history on Facebook.
During this period of time Bjartmar has been engaged in this practice, he says that he can count the trades he encountered with people on his other hand.
“I’ve been in a peaceful relationship with the most difficult people in the world, ” said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, insane people, and other people on the street for some reason.
“The addiction is hard on the master, and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately, theft is an easy way to achieve this, ” says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
For example, people went to treatment and then went to see me and helped me with what I'm doing," he says.
Generally speaking, Bjartmar’s dealings with riders are polite.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer him peaceably to show him the receipts, the seat number of the bicycles, and so forth.
Theft of bicycles is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even pointing out that they are talking to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar disagrees with previous news transmission DV and claims not to be any self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not come to the ice shelf by his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar.
“Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have to picture police driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
It is plainly said without mercy in these matters."
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this cause, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says that he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels that sometimes he encounters his “squatters ” on the street that they have only just the Brighter Wheels that they had previously recovered.
The changes Bjartmar has called for police assistance have caused her simply not to show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owner of the riding bikes,” said Bjartmar, and I’m sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from an empty police force in this case.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
Many stories can be found of people thanks to Bjartmari for recovering their possessions.
Bjartmar himself says that the number of bicycles he has returned has long been lost, but the amounts will probably run on millions, if not millions.
Weighing electric buggies, electric wheels, and electric bullets, a wheel that can cost less than half a million.
Bjortmar works at a playtime school, and every weekend he works in a community.
So his bicycle search is unrewarded work that he does in his spare time.
Life insurance funds and long shadows
In 2019, there was a big birthday in Iceland.
True, officials had received a pension from the king of Dan from the 19th century onward, but in 1919 an official pension fund was established, which eventually became the life insurance fund of all public employees.
The foundation of the current life insurance funds of general employees was then laid down in 1969 with a total of core agreements on the labour market, with employment-related pension funds with compulsory contributions and a fully-fledged fundraising from 1970 onward.
Then, in 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these contracts, and the retirement system continued to grow.
The payroll system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor movement brought about by its nuclear struggle.
In 1955, unemployment insurance had similarly been awarded in historic battles, and the organizations were gradually given their demands for sickness and sickness, for a considerable amount of leave, for a reduction in working hours, for improvements in housing, and for other things as much as possible.
All these rights cost a great and severe battle, but they were, after thinking, far greater and more permanent than the increase in the money in the payroll, which disappeared as hard in the face of inflation as marked by the postwar period and until 1990 as many remember.
In 1969, the contributor to the creation of a general life insurance fund was both long and complex.
Although the funds would eventually become the property of a fundmate, the labor movement had to agree that their governments were to appoint representatives of employees and fundmates alike.
In the following years after the fund was set up, the requirement for the majority of workers in the board of funds was often discussed in a payroll organization, but it never worked out, so we still have the unusual arrangement that representatives of fund partners are not in the majority of the governments of the funds.
Article 36 of Law No 129/1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the functioning of pension funds discusses the investment policy of the funds.
It states in the 1st issue that “a pension fund should guide the interests of social partners. ”
Also, in the fifth issue, “a pension fund should set moral standards in investments. ”
The trade union policy of the Lifelong Shopping Agency includes the following provisions, followed by the above-mentioned legal provisions:
The Life Resources Fund is part of the UN PRI rules on responsible investment, along with many of the largest living and professional investment funds in the Western and European oceans.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good governance can contribute to improved investment performance in the stock markets.
This brings together the interests of society’s investors and goals in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those registered in the stock market, adopt a public policy: to operate in a good way of governance, social responsibility and environmental responsibility.
The life insurance fund Valdi, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself “a policy of responsible investment, ” and there are similar provisions.
This is all reflected here as an introduction to the latest fashion word of Icelandic, “shadow control. ”
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not a hope that it has been defined in full, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “most ‘most taken’: Shadow management is when a trade union leader says in the media that he is going to send instructions or instructions on how to take a stand in a particular case to the representatives of the society in the management of a life insurance fund.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be removed from government at their first opportunity.
However, if the leader does not take this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not “shadow - control ” because, of course, human relations are always in the financial world, as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to reflect on how he feels “closer. ”
There are particularly two people who have tried to make this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
This is the hard work of a journalist in the Newspaper and Ásgeir Jonsson, banker of the bank.
The reason for both came about after the president of Bogi Nils Bogason, Icelandair, had announced his intention to break off the company’s agreements with flight attendants and pilots (supposing them), and Ragnar Tór Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavik Trade Union, sent them the recommendations to the representatives of the Society in the Management of the Sales Agency not to support the potential purchase of the funds on the company’s shares, or they might be relieved.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor followed by his recommendation, which, of course, centered on Boga’s decision.
Nevertheless, in the Friday issue of the Newspaper, they saw the need for discussion in Hard and Ásgeir with great words about shadow management, law enforcement, and the need for legal changes.
There a small dove would certainly wonder about a heavy barrage, although the blessed dove had been in the process of entourage and had been wiped out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself at the end.
I spoke here in advance of the points in the life insurance laws that give rise to this matter.
These include fund - governments that are responsible for the interests of social partners and that have moral standards in investments, and these are detailed in the approvals of both Gildis and the Life - Style Fund of merchants, as I mentioned.
However, life insurance funds should NOT look only at short - term dividends in their investments.
Such a course would be very dangerous, and it would not be necessary to look for examples of such things in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have gone to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
The president of Icelandair was obviously on the ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus greatly reducing the goodwill enjoyed by the company in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Happily, he saw and pulled it back.
Time shows whether it is enough to ensure that the investment of a life insurance fund in the company can be held accountable to a fundmate at the end of the day.
A former professor of physics and science.
One of the infected did not practice home hypersensitivity
One of the three that was diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the land of the Baltic on July 15 last, about a week and a half ago.
However, he is an Icelandic who is not regularly resident here, and he did not receive clear instructions to use so - called home psychiatry after arriving in the country and to perform another demonstration a few days after his arrival.
He was negatively screened at the border.
“But he’s in an Icelandic community, and he’s actually going into it, ” says Kamilla Josepsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease prevention at Land doctor’s and a surrogate health care practitioner during his summer vacation, in a conversation with the Newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the reference number and if the reference number is not registered then you are not automatically announced in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually living abroad, but because of his connection with the country as an Icelandic, he should have used it rather.
However, he did not realize this.
“When the ID is not registered, you have to strive for the second sample yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seems to have realized that this was the right way," says Kamilla.
“This makes it clear that we need to improve the information about this while we find some way to do an automatic preaching system even though the Icelandics do not record their indexes.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Happily, though, few people are associated with the country even though it is defined as a participant in an Icelandic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six were sent to prison after he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They're going to take a sample, but two of them are starting to show the signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative results from his demonstration at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the fact that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with her to the country.
“It is not quite possible to say that this is certainly an infective disease because it has been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little war in connection with the sporting events.”
However, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“It’s really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but says that it cannot be ruled out until an Icelandic genetic analysis has sorted out the virus in man.
“If we get a virus type that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he carried it to the country.”
Pepper spray and bombs applied against Protestants
A conflict took place between the Seattle police and Protestants last night.
The police used pepper spray and nonfatal grenades, but protestors broke their windows and set fire to fire.
45 protesters were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many parts of the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one of the protesters was shot to death.
As noted on the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands met in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
Subsequently, the police said the protests were dishonest, and a conflict arose between Protestant and police groups.
Claiming justice in Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man murdered by the police in August last year, was remembered by Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of officers of the black force came together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by the police in her home last March.
The group carried guns and marched in groups at closed street conventions, where the police were associated with a group of protesters and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man who was murdered by a white baroque in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, director of Manchester United, doesn't want to overdo the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final round of the English Grand Prix.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, end the Sunshine and his men in the fifth seat and thus lose of the Master's seat.
Then, though, they should still hope to get to the Master’s Department by winning the European Division next month.
“We haven’t reached an end point yet.
If we get a score against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this isn't the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of land to catch the two teams above us," said Solarskjær.
Clearly, people’s nerves will be tedious at 3 p.m. today, but Sunshine tried to act like every other game was involved.
“If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It's nothing new, and this is what makes the company.
We've created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it's ours to use it," said Sunshine.
“This isn’t the most important game of the period, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our period; we have already had many hours to define this period."
“The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed a great deal for us, and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period,” said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new infections of the coronal virus were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the west from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 died from the virus yesterday but the last four days until the virus died more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 146,460 virus deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the prophecy of the U.S. authorities of disease prevention, the number of virus deaths will be 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of the Second Wave of the Epidemic
The Spanish government is now trying to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country from becoming weaker.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been any more reports in one day since the beginning of May, and the news is coming at the same time as the Spanish are beginning to lift one of the most severe curfews in Europe.
This setback led the British authorities to force passengers from Spain to go to prison at their return home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The worst situation is in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, where governments have taken on more extensive restrictions to try to match the growth rate.
In the capital of Barselona, entertainment sites will be closed for the next two weeks and wavehouses will be closed at midnight.
There is now an exit ban for 200 000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which is deeply underpinned by the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly hit by the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel office, canceled all scheduled flights today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in resuming a massive curfew that has destroyed the economy in many parts of the world.
To form, Boris Johnson, British prime minister, has taken such things very badly and compared them to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then Jean Castex, France’s prime minister, said that the nation “would not survive, economically or socially, ” if exiled nationally.
Many councillors hope that local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or areas will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Thus, five individuals with positive Covid-19 infection were identified yesterday in Iceland.
A report from the Public Health Service reports that one infection is related to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close association with him in a case of sickness.
As a member of a sports club in Reykjavik, this infected person is reported to be “only a part of the sports team ” in Sick Bay.
Others who were sent to the hospital are otherwise related to the person.
The source of this infection is undetected and infective by a federal police officer.
The ReyCUP meeting holders have followed the guidelines and rules of the current health care practitioner and public health care system and have taken appropriate measures.
However, images of the convention alerted yesterday, where a very close association could be seen to welcome their team’s success in the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, opposers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It reads: “ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants themselves pick up their stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Other infections were detected yesterday but related to the infection reported last day.
Says the report: “Icelandic gene analysis has sorted the infection and revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected before. ”
This is also a case of contamination, which is infected with isolation and 12 infected by the infection.
The third infection involved is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was identified on the southwest corner of the country.
The person is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close association with him in sickness.
Two of them are already showing signs of viral transmission.
In addition, two of them were identified at the border, and they are waiting for the results of further research, such as the transmissible work force at the border.
Finally, the report states: The Department of Public Administration and the National Veterinary Office urge people to take care and care about individual infectious agents.
If there is any doubt as to whether the Covid-19 virus’s symptoms are present, the same one is asked to be screened at the nearest health care centre.
Padretsfjörður says the tent area is booked for commercial weekends - Direct guests other
This weekend, according to the report of the West, the tent area of the district of Padrek is fully booked.
Visitors should be advised to consider alternative gait options.
What are the names of the western parts of the Bildu Valley, Talknäður, Melanes, Red sand, Hotel Flocalund, and Hotel Breiðavik?
There is enough to be at the parish of this weekend, for as in previous years, the town of Skäldborg, a celebration of Icelandic documentary pictures will be held in the town.
Since 2007, it has become a strong tradition in town.
An application to the tent area can be expected to be met well this year, if weather does not put a line in the account, but DV told us earlier today about a bad prophecy.
But the worst of the south is to be expected, and the hope of the Padrethites.
The tissue bb.is first reported, and said that all other lodgings in the town were already fully booked.
Whole multi-dwelling houses cave down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely in Dunhaga 18-20.
During this period, owners seek a permit to rebuild, but their business has been moving through the system in a third year.
In one of the oldest, grandest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik, there is a spacious, three - story, multidwelling house.
On the ground floor of the house, there are about 600 square feet [600 sq m] of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four rather magnificent apartments.
They range from 93 to 130 square meters, but most of them are over 100.
The house has a lot of history.
It was built in 1959 and has host video rentals, the School Room, the dairy store of the Milk Sales Agency, Joa gunsmiths, fish sales, and now the final High School Print.
The house has, in order to be mildly spoken, been remembered as a fig of beauty.
The house is now subject to severe damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18.
The owners of D18 are according to the company register among others Magnússon and Gudrunn Helga Larusdóttir.
Marcus served as the owner of the Paying Group and was a defender of the Society for Ownership of the Paying Society.
One of the owners of the Society of Owners is the Steel Ship, Ehf.
The steel ship, e.g., is the investment company of the Gudrun of Helga Larusdódur and her children.
At the same time, Gudrún is the owner of the third part of the D18 river.
Gudrun and her husband, Augustus Gudmund the son of Sigurðh, once ran the steel ship.
D18 euf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and thus has little or nothing to hold on to since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has worsened steadily since, but most recently.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one resident says that the house “was not particularly lively in the last few years. ”
This may include the fact that for some years, owners have sought to change the house and the property.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been okay for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something decent with this spot and boring that it’s been so slow. ”
At the same time, he says that he is mad at the owner of the house for not having worked hard to finish this, for finding a common area with his neighbors, and for stopping this “legislative step. ”
"Just do this in consultation with the community around so that you can get this done and finish it."
The ‘legal step’ referred to by the resident is the organisational process that has been in progress since at least 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were asked for permission to build a floor on the current residential building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and an annex on one floor in addition to a basement.
The building permit granted for this project was awarded to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the Committee rejected it because the project was not supported by a dispute organisation and the notification of the site was not sufficient.
Then, a city of incense started a dispute - settlement project and ended it with an advertisement in July last year.
That organization was also indicted and brought it to an end in March 2020.
At this point, then, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house were in the starting place.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors had grown weary.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the reactions of their neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the purpose of the house’s owner, others not at all.
Others directed their anger toward the city, others not.
Others were only angry, but nothing was necessarily to anyone.
Still others said that the parking lot was a conflict, but neighbors have new unused parking lot of Dunhaga 18-20 under their vehicles.
One plaintiff in the case said he was tired of the administration:
“ Let’s go through the process for three times is absolutely amazing.
It's like Reykjavik City doesn't know how to read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A reminder of the city’s soaring management, the noble intentions of the owner, and the many years of work of those now in their infancy.
When a newspaperman carried to the park in Dunhaga 18, he was blasted with a wide - open door and a pile of garbage.
Playstation computers and recent TVs lay around another garbage on earth — victims of Icelandic summer blankets.
It was opened into the old university paper office, and there are plenty of cats to judge by the smell of sedation.
Clearly, someone has moved in one corner, but no one is visible.
A pile of couches and beds and a few pages of earthenware pages that would no doubt become a book burst into flames.
At the same time, the entrances to the apartment were open and life in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to run into one of their inhabitants.
There, the Romanians were boiling potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce ehf employee rent.
They have been there for some time and mimic DV reports that the company has paid nothing for the housing except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, renting is not justified.
The situation of mail in the front door of the house makes it clear that there have been many foreign workers in the last few misses.
The company has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, since the contraction of tourism has led to contractions in the building sector, and these two industries have been the most successful in using the services of the owner-occupiers.
Nevertheless, at the age of 18, the family members in Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough work to do, and the workers and the people in the community were hanging out for a long day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist said good - bye to the boys in bed, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet [1,500 sq m] of real estate is demolished.
Owners want to change the house for the better, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but they want to argue about the definition of “improvement. ”
Between then, the city's organizational field sits on the ground, the victim of endless appeal routes and the potential for organisation and the floating seas of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
In the house, so do bedtime workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelandics stop fighting.

In the fight against overweight following a chronic viral epidemic
Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on quick - bit advertising, following a serious illness, partly because of his weight.
It says that Johnson will present the campaign, promised to be a better greeting, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be urged to prescribe bicycle rides for their clients in excess of weight and will also engage in a campaign to increase the number of bicycle rides.
Then commercials on television will be banned by 21 p.m., according to British media reports.
"COVID-19 has raised us against the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food," said the government spokesman.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was placed in intensive care when he became infected with the coronal virus in the spring, and in part because of his weight, he is believed to have become so seriously ill.
Women Are Declined to Lead the Change
She said that the new constitution was the greatest step that the nation could take to increase the distribution of power, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the interests of the entire world.
“We need to start changing gear a little now, and who is better off leading such changes than the group of society that has easier access to these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their commitment to women.
To stand together and be together to bring about change.
So now it's just time for us to lead these changes."
She said she was a little worried about the emphasis on Iceland as the "best in the world" in both gender rights and human rights.
“ Then we’re not as ready to look at what needs to be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and consider all that needs to be done.
There's a lot.
We must know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of all groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
On demand, she said that women were in good health in Iceland, but she added that, as elsewhere, Iceland was built by enormous male values.
She said that politics was turned around to form one’s own interests, authority, and power, which were the forces that maintained disparity in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together, and have become a little annoyed that the General Assembly is going to look beyond this national referendum since 2012," she said.
“ It’s these women’s values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really at the same level," she said, adding that the former values were the basic values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich land of natural resources, and it’s ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to struggle forever just to get a decent salary."
The signing list of the new constitution can be signed here by electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking roadman in the city center
A man was arrested in the middle of town the night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the manufacture of drugs in Town of Year, where two were arrested for the issue.
Then the police stopped a motorbike driver in the Caves, where its driver was at 146 km [60 km / hr], with a maximum speed of 60 km / hr.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and were listed in over 80 cases in a police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a lot of noise on social gatherings.
Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy gatherings were very popular in a police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noises were voiced by police.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
During the Year, a police officer was called up to night when people fired fireworks.
However, they had escaped when police officers were in the garden.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped before drunkenness and drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city center last night, one of which was stored in a prison cell.
Then two were moved to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the middle of town, and the other in the West.
One was transferred to an accident ward after he was injured in jumping onto a trampoline in Copavogi.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a trailer on Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police diary, the trailer was in “very bad condition ” and was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house for the shopping weekends.
The house in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next night in the house is about the shopping weekends.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on the Airbnb page it is next available after a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore might be ideal for some shopkeepers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights spent on commercial weekends cost only 964 U.S. dollars, or just over 130 thousand dollars, depending on the next issue of the Newspaper.
Tens and some of them started to show the symptoms of the coronary virus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronary virus domestically in the last three days and are most of the infected unconnected.
Because of this, tens of them have contracted disease, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronal virus domestically yesterday and two at border crossings.
According to a regional doctor’s office, an increasing number of domestic infections do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading to the wider community.
“ It’s been sorted out from the first domestic infection, and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before, so we don’t have any particular reason to think that it’s been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigriður Josephsdóttir, an expert in the field of national health services.
Most of them have been associated with individuals from abroad.
More samples are needed in the near future than some that were in association with the infected are showing the symptoms of the coronal virus.
“Now there is no influenza and less of other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing these tests on individuals who at the time of the flu have found reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not impossible for anyone else to catch disease.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sports events.
It has raised questions as to whether holding such events is justified.
The communication manager of public transports says it very slowly as long as people follow criteria and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to become infected at the sporting events.
“If these individuals are left out of isolation after their association at these sports events, we can claim that our conventions were effective.
But it hasn't been revealed," said Kamilla.
The work of the Public Protection Department is under constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if this seems appropriate,” said Kamilla.
After a week or so, a thousand people will be cleared up to the limit.
This new position could affect the proposal.
"Determining Food" - See the menu of Eliza Vidars
Elisha Vidarsdóttir is a performer of soccer and plays with Val.
She is also a master’s student in nutrition, a mother, and serves as a food expert.
It needs a lot of energy for the day’s needs and usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
"My normal day starts by coming to work from eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the camp to prepare my dinner before I pick up my girl at the nursery at about three o’clock. ”
Elisha feels very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it is good to come home and just warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our mind."
Elisha does not have a certain diet.
She is putting her final hand on a master’s thesis in nutrition science, so she knows well what it takes for her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family, and exercises.
“ What’s best for me is to eat a wide variety of foods, well composed of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to grade food into bad or good, rather nutritious, or poor nutrition.
It's okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“I find myself thinking about standing in the kitchen cooking and getting a lot of it.
I have to say that the confidence is with me in the kitchen and I firmly believe that I am a fine cook."
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seed, salt, a little lemon juice, left in almond milk over the night.
Topple this meal as much as you can every time.
Usually it's a banana and it's a jump in the mouse and it's a bump in the head.
I'm a big coffeemaker.
Intermediates: Amazingly different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shirts with banana and mouse, bread with an appetizer, and so I could eat hummus with a spoon out of the chest if that is the case.
Lunchtime: I often make all kinds of high - food salads from what is in the refrigerator, quinoa or barley, falafelballs, rock salads, well - dressed overcooked vegetables is something I’m working with.
If the organization gets completely out of control (which happens often) then the egg machine in my work has been a lot of times to save me, and then it's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, put no more on you.
Intermediary: Give me something rich in carbohydrates for exercise, for bread with tea, for breakfast, or for fruit.
Dinner: Fish are very often chosen in my home, or some delicious vegetable dishes.
Conflicts between the police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of rebellion following a large number of protests in the city center.
Yesterday the police seized bombs and pepper sprays to try to clear a large area occupied by Protestants and stretched over many lengths of buildings in the nearby Assembly Hall in the city.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that an investigation was being carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that Protestants have stoned the police with stones, bottles, blasts and other sordid things, and one police officer was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
Still, Seattle’s protests were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was theirs to show protestors in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated conflicts between Protestants and the heavily armed forces of the FBI.
There, like in other cities in the United States, people gather under the signals of Black Lives Matter, remembering Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systematic racism in American society and demanding compensation.
Not revoked until after voice payment
There is still no question of the revocation of the resignation of the flight attendant Icelandair, who will be valid for the next month.
An electronic vote on Iceland's airline agreement on behalf of a flight attendant at Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
Godglaug Liney Johannsdóttir, chairman of the Society, assures us that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusion of the vote is reached.
"It's definitely hanging together," says Gudlaug Liney.
“ There has been no cancellation, so this must be done so that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people will be anxious to know if they will have a job after the month's end."
The prize is for a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected that it will be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously signed by flight attendants.
On July 17th, the Icelandic Air Force Administration and Credentials Council agreed to announce a full military stoppage at Icelandair.
She never came, but this was decided upon following the decision of Icelandair to discontinue discussions with the Flying Ladyship, cancel all her flight attendants, and look for agreements with another trade union.
At that time, the company’s pilots were to take on the ship temporarily.
Asked how she feels that the vote will go, Gutlaug Liney says that it is difficult to say.
“People are hurt by this move by Icelandair, when all of the company’s flight attendants were dismissed and announced that a deal would be made with another trade union.
Now it becomes apparent whether it has any effect," she says.
940 flight attendants worked at Icelandair at the end of April, and 900 of them, about 95%, were retired.
Their delay is long, and in three months' time with those who have the shortest career, and ends at the end of the month of July-August.
There's about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants in that group.
What will happen if the contract is not approved?
“ Then we wish for further discussions with our associates.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelandair's demands.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
Votes for the nuclear agreement will be concluded and Icelandair will be presenting the second quarter of tomorrow
A flight attendant's vote on a new deal ends at noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's calculation for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company's revenues have decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the agreement between the Icelandic Airlines and the Icelandair Business Association began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27th, at noon.
Those who are eligible to vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social contributions to the Aeronautical Society.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new nuclear agreement on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday earlier, Icelandair had interrupted discussions with the company after the flight attendants had cancelled the previous agreement in vote payment at the beginning of July.
At that time, Icelandair had told all the flight attendants and airmen of the company on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the signing of a new agreement.
According to a new agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more a month before the same basic salary.
The agreement is valid until 2025, where pilots and pilots have been integrated into the regulations for how long they can fly on one watch.
The agreement was introduced to FFI’s associates at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many flight attendants who were discussed by a newsroom about their dissatisfaction with the contract.
Most people, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved to keep the FIFI alive.
Icelandair will be listed for another quarter of a year tomorrow, except for the EBIT, its operating income for the financial and tax sectors, which, according to preliminary export results, is negative for 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars or about 15 billion U.S. dollars.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Royal Palace last Wednesday, where it said that the company’s income was about $60 million in a quarter or about $8.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, some $14 million (U.S.).
At the same time, Icelandair aims to offer the company’s assets in August.
Icelandair is planning to conclude a deal with 15 loan lords, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of a month before going on a partial financial mission.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“ A new virus just means that it has been a foreign person.
This is not something that has been going on in this country," says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Land Hospital's infectious disease department, who reports that “a new type of virus” has been diagnosed in this country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two were detected at the border.
One who had been identified as a member of a sports club at the Rey Cup, the source of infection and infection.
An individual who came to the country on 15 July and two who were in association with him began to show signs and symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday an infection related to infection was detected that was reported in the morning and after sequencing in the Icelandic genetic analysis, “a new type of virus that has not previously been detected. ”
Immunisation is complete in connection with that infection.
It is noted that it is not a new virus but is the same virus and has a global spread, i.e. the new coronal virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what that means and whether it could say anything about the beginning of another epidemic wave, Már says that as it is, there is a single case, and it could be no more of it.
"However, if there were cases of domestic origin not related to a foreign country with the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [on the second wave], but it is premature to do so," Már explains.
Good luck in the hot tub.
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelandics hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC’s schedulers lead to a similar video that sheds light on the country’s pool and hotspot culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique worldwide, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are as many baths in every resident.
Natural global warming is the foundation of it, but it is also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Children’s education was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less capable of using water to improve their health.
Swift travel is described as a permanent part of the general well - being of the country.
Everyone in the pot is equal, regardless of class and position.
Freed from mobile phones, people discuss at home, space, or enjoy the graceful power of the water: thoughts and loads of batteries of the soul and body.
Should the track pick up a hundred days in elections?
There are hundreds of days until the United States votes and elects a president for four years.
Donald Trump is seeking reelection, but he is to be picked up.
Joe Biden, who is expected to present the Democratic Party, has a strong national advantage over Trump, taken into account by the pollsters.
According to a recent AP study, the United States estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to the pandemic of the new coronary virus is very unpopular, and in addition, more Americans believe that the president has been in trouble with the economy.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say that they support Trump’s reaction to the epidemic, and 48 percent say that he has kept an eye on the economy.
In March it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationwide followed by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his attitude toward the epidemic to Biden, promote so - called cultural disputes, and proclaim policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden’s offer, however, is keen to keep an eye on Trump and is very likely to win if the election is really about how Trump has been doing the job in the last four years.
It also seems that unpopular Trump is going to attack the Republican Congressmen and fear that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very popular.
Politico reported that in the daytime, he was keeping in line with the classes and the provider, and that is what the Republican group would now have its greatest record for decades.
The district has been particularly bad in the 2016 congressional elections, and it is now clear that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to frighten the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow him, including by saying that he will become President Biden, he will destroy the U.S. outbacks and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulation from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, which was designed to increase the diversity of the suburbs.
Then he encouraged the “housewives ” of the U.S. to read an article from the former Deputy Governor of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the U.S. outlying areas and agreed with Trump.
“Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I'll keep it, and even make it even better!" said the President.
The inhabitants of the U.S. are an ever - increasing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the majority of this group’s votes have become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney received a majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
The polls have shown that, despite Trump’s securing the majority in the neighbourhoods of 2016, its follow-up has been considerably tightened.
Although there are differences between the surveys, Biden has estimated a 15 - percent advantage over Trump in the outlays in the past.
Regis Philbin is dead
American TV man Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin served as an actor, director, introducer, and singer for about six decades.
He is one of the best known for running the popular live! with Regis chat games from 1988 to 2011 together with Katie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he's run things like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most of his hours on American television and has been recognized by him.
He won six Emmy awards for his career and was named 37 times in total.
It is stated by his family that Philbin died from natural causes.
The number of associates, friends, and fans has referred to the community media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the halls?
After a final decision was taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have brought about this, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympics would be famous “the light at the end of the halls, ” and it probably referred to the world’s coronarian epidemic that the world is now going through in unity.
Africans have added years to prepare themselves and governments in Japan to make up for the delay.
Everyone, however, keeps their heads in check.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were truly joyful.
They cried and laughed at each other, for Tokyo had applied to hold the games in 2016, but it bowed down to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were invited to the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24 through August 9, but have been postponed for a year and will begin instead on July 23, 2021, and will end on August 8.
If you don't keep the game, if you still have too much of a threat to the crown virus, the games will be aborted.
Yet, no one wants to think that way to the end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be wonderful and strive to top up the last game.
The choice of the city of Olympics is based on the assessment of the election committee on the city’s presentations.
The grander the presentation — the more likely it is to be given the gnat.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympic Games or worth over $2 billion.
For the second time, when the 2020 games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion (U.S.) on the project.
However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean, based on what it takes to build an Olympic village, a stadium, and generally to strengthen the interior of the country to cope with such conventions, to prepare them, and to hold the games themselves.
Organizations in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be going on these days but have been delayed for about a year because of the Crown Virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government accountant in Japan, published at the end of the last year, revealed that the cost was almost double that figure.
While it is likely that the cost of delaying games will not be fully assessed, it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could range from $15 to $30 billion.
There are so high numbers that all taxes of the Icelandic State were only about half the Olympic Games, compared with the lowest possible cost.
Olympic games are an event of the magnitude that they have often become the subject of economics, who try to explore numbers and see the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less positive for the economy of the cities that keep them.
For example, a large number of jobs are short - term, but for a long time, cities tend to be in debt - ridden, and the high operating costs of little - used manpower.
Rio, Brazil, has been in serious debt for the 2016 games and has been in trouble for the maintenance of all the major sporting activities that were built for the games.
After the 2012 London Games, only 10 percent of those who received a job related to the Olympic Games in the city have been found to be unemployed before.
This means that there were no new jobs except in a small way.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in holding the Olympics financially because of the sluggish cost of the human beings that are built for the games.
However, the benefits are often seen as a result of increased travel by tourists who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which are, however, very uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accept all the crowds who normally pick up the games.
The main thing, though, is the honor that the cities are given to be chosen, but it is difficult to appreciate for money.
In spite of enormous costs, it may also be said that the joy that the games bring is not that it can be put on a price.
Of course, even if the show is magnificent and is not saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
To some outstanding people, it is only surprising that we welcome the postponement of the games.
For example, on the page of the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, the Australian five - third - year - old and gold - prize winner is a casolite and would have been far from being a good joke for the summer, but he has the hope of being in a competition for the 2021 games.
So she is among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who wanted to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, meaning that in some cases they quit the game before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes were as well placed in the hearts of audiences at the 2016 Rio Olympics as did the gymnasium star Simone Biles.
She brought home four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been here for several interviews in his home country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She plans to play the 2021 games, but she is not necessarily sure she can still be on the top of the games next year, since she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be a high age, it is higher for a gymnast in the front row.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles in another interview that was published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked if she is going to make it as far as the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I just don’t know if I’m still at the top after a year of practice, ” says Biles.
In the past, she has said that her body is not able to cope with the stress that comes from gym training much longer.
Nevertheless, she has been training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was uncomfortable to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was at its peak and the gym was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others during the seven - week closure of all sports activities.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others; she needed to find various ways to stay in shape as others did.
Certainly, the basic form is slightly better than that of most people.
“We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start rehearsing first after the gym opened.
We started slowly, but I have come back to the full course, and I will continue to add to the exercises as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games will be like or whether they will be held, but we can’t do anything else.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now," says Biles.
Like others, it makes no sense, or perhaps even more aware, that the situation may reveal that the games are not held at all in 2021.
However, predicting that is hopeless.
No one can know what the world epidemic situation will be like in July 2021 and what else to do but to prepare for the Olympic Games on the basis that they will be held in the year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid.
Delayed Marriage for Episode
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the chronicle virus.
She was supposed to marry the ex-Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
“ We’d love to get married sometime and have the dream wedding and have all the people who love us.
But we decided to put it off and focus on what is important today, and it is helping to share information about the importance of wearing a mask and staying at home.
I look at world affairs more than wedding affairs these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
