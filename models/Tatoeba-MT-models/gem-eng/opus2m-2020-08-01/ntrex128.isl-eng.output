Welcoming stewards are concerned about "looking like a fool"
Some administrators suggest changing their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Parliament).
Concerns have arisen about a plan to change the Council’s name to the Welsh Senate.
Governors of all walks of life are concerned that this could make them laugh.
One member of the workers’ team said that his group was concerned that “it is rhyming with Twp and Pwp. ”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means feces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru group said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and made other suggestions.
A member of the Velz band said that his group had “an open mind ” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the word MWP and Muppet (flon).
In this context, it can be noted that the w letter is pronounced in the same way as the u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on the bill for tabling the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names of members of the Council will, of course, be with members themselves. ”
The Wales Government of Wales Act (2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the council published the results of public polls, which showed great support for calling the council a ‘ welfare council. ’
With regard to the executive title, the WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, Welsh Congressmen) was elected, but MWP received the highest level of public support in the polls.
According to news, administrators are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the board, Elin Jones, to submit a bill for the changes within a few weeks.
The reform initiative will also include other changes in the way the board operates, including rules on the removal of the board members and the organisation of the committee system.
Governors will be able to pay final votes for their title when discussions on the bill begin.
Macedonians vote in elections for a change of name in the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to 'North Macedonia'.
This matter was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve decades of conflict with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens City has long argued that its neighbours' names in the north are equivalent to their demands on its territory and have repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, the supporters of the vote, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the change in name is simply the price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and NATO.
The church bell of St. Martin's sound is a church in Harlem's in trouble
“ The older people I’ve talked to said that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner of the street, ” said Adams.
"Today there is neither."
He said it would be understandable for a bar to be lowered.
“People have other ways of meeting” today, he said.
"Bars are no longer the hubs of the neighborhood where people meet regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money received from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders expect “and sooner or later they will be back on the ground. ”
He added that possible churches would be replaced outside homes filled with people who would not help save the neighbor’s remaining places of refuge.
“ The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and will therefore speed up the permanent closure of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who move in these apartments will become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s church in the decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
The congregation of black people who had worked nearby took over the building.
The Dark Congregation took over St. Martin’s church under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who had taken the initiative to oust shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main store street, who wanted to hire black workers or give them promotions.
The building was severely damaged by fire in 1939, but members of Rev. Johnson’s congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had them build the clock.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Reverend Johnson, proudly called the clock “the clock of the poor. ”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Human Resources ” and“ Unique Historical Music. ”
The professor, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved over to a larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had no one else in his place.
In the past month, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some of whom have been hired by church leaders and others by the bishops.
The Church Council, which oversees the application and is appointed as church leaders, wrote the Episcopal Order in July and expressed its concern that the Episcopal Order “would seek to bring the cost to the church council, ” even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the Episcopal Order.
Some members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the Episcopal Church.
Shark hurts a 13-year-old boy who fell asleep in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster fishing season.
The attack occurred just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon’s Beach Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yelling for help and then tumbling over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was only a matter of excitement to have had a whim, but then “he realized that the boy cried out“ I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
All his bones were torn up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There is a shark in the water! ’ ” added Hammel.
The boy was transferred by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he lies severely wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
The captain of the beach guard, Larry Giles, said at a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed off beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for study and safety purposes.
Giles said that over 135 different shark species are present in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to take a leap into Britain’s beauty market
Sainsbury’s plan is to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in a shopping mall style and with specialized assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is 2.8 billion pounds worth and is growing as sales of fashion and household goods decline.
Assimilation in cosmetics is part of a major market for the use of a previously used battery compartment made of optics, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury’s claim is that it will double its beauty selection in up to 3000 types of products, including trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L‘Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store is also planning to resell its boutique cosmetics selection so that the majority of the goods are affordable, but younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test a warehouse in two shops of Sainsbury’s, the first one opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and increased consumer tendency to buy small quantities of food every day in neighborhoods mean that large markets need to make more effort to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury’s, said that the transactions would be more and more like shopping centres when the chain tries to fight the low-value stores of Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since the two chains were bought two years ago, which, according to them, has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt of the shop to revitalize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, but this ended due to differences in how to share the proceeds of drug sales in the supermarket.
The new approach is followed by the sale by Sainsbury’s 281-year-old pharmaceutical companies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical companies, of 125 million pounds (U.S.) three years ago.
According to policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury spray labels, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, market manager of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the look of our cleaning shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be available for advice.
Our lipstick selection is designed to meet all needs. A charming environment and comfortable location make us an exciting beauty shop that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "Awesome" after Holly Willoughby ends on 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, a star from Dragons Den, became “delicious” after the TV set Holly Willoughby terminated 11 million pounds of contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home items and accessories label, Truly.
The company had been likened to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37 - year - old in this morning, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, with a painful forehead by canceling participation in a popular lifestyle company at the last moment to focus on new and lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones has been “an arduous” at a difficult meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business department in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the television woman popularly admitted she did not have enough time for the home goods and supplies label Truly because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been likened to Goop, the trademark of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double the property of Willoughby, but their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced to Instagram that she was going to pull herself out of Truly, Jones from Britain flew to live in one of her many summer homes.
One source reported: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future work that would accomplish her next two decades.
Her decision to stop came completely to the fore.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went to market.
There's a stock of goods at Marlow's headquarters that's ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of this morning’s introduction, which is among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost the company millions because of large cargo iron fasteners, ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, and possibly lead to further delays in the sale of the product line.
This too could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman of the government in March.
Couples spend their summer vacations together, and Jones shares 40 percent in the company of Baldwin, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S trade mark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I'm a Celebrity ITV.
Last night, a source named Jones said: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
“ Then we fell in love ”
He grumbled with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the presidents, and for being so positive towards the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Trump said, and he imitated a reporter's voice.
"I haven't left anything behind."
He stated that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
On the other hand, nuclear disarmament negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the main ambassador of North Korea, told international leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States continued its business ventures for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was all the more positive in his meeting talk.
"We're very close to North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim had brought back positive results — missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of the United States soldiers had been returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It’s so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international relief agencies were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, an emergency situation was not declared, which is essential for the international community to have relief work there.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organisations, so this is difficult,” said Ms. Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children Association is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign relief workers can take up work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Emergency Response Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if the international community should help in the relief work.
Considering the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is sadly badly prepared to resist the forces of nature.
Flood waves have been built in Aceh, which is a rare sight on other shorelines.
It seems that the lack of flood - wave jets in Palu has increased the number of deaths, even though a warning has been issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia may be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
An ambulance that has docked in Lombok to guard that the victims of the earthquake are now on their way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main point of his campaign to improve downhill Indonesia’s transit routes and has put a lot of money in the way and in the railways.
However, lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko’s government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to contend with persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious policy.
More than 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with their swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the prime department by scoring for 89 minutes at the Saturday game at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the target of Chelsea when his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to target the distance.
The ball flew high above the target and toward its right corner.
Finally, the ball went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touch once and didn’t think so much about it, but just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
On the visit, Chelsea's visitor handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a heel and then sprang from the middle to the half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball walk fast between the center.
Then he sent forward the ball beautifully and sent Hazard in for a whiskers' doughnut.
Hazard ran defensemen off and scored to the remote corner with a left foot shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool’s goalkeeper.
Liverpool is playing against Napoli in the first place of the prime department at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the UEFA European unit at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths increases to 832 after a tidal wave in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and the tidal wave in Indonesia has increased to 832, according to an early Sunday report from the National Emergency Response Agency.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Agency, said at a news conference that a lot of people had been buried when buildings fell into the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, causing a wave of floods up to 6 meters high.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murder, after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's likeness was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44 - year - old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32 - year - old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have encouraged people in the area to make their appearance if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O'Hagan, researcher at Birkenhead, said: “The investigation is right, but I would like to ask all those who were close to John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially a taxi driver, who might have caught something in the picture with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our research."
The police officer has confirmed that the woman who died lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside the apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are working to inform the victim’s closest associates.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could come into the building or leave it.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
People have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back inside.
A police officer heard a man say that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She keeps repeating: “It’s so terrible. ”
At 2: 00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the marked area of the police station and one car just outside.
A large number of policemen stood within the marked area and watched the residential buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact the Crime Line on the phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from September 30.
Shortening the British Congress of Cromwell is the latest memo that is accused of "rewriting history"
The statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban devastation of its superstitious Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious treasures of England.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was 'poor' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion that is about to be cut off, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be placed before the battle.
The Anoft English Civil War against the Cultural Signs was neither a command nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed to his forefather Thomas in the preceding century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, marks the 19th century period and is part of the history of a man who many believe is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the Congress against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
It is still a matter of historical controversy whether this description is correct in all respects.
However, it is clear that the struggles in the mid-17th century have shaped our nation’s development and that Cromwell is a known person who represents one side of their struggle.
It is worth hoarding and remembering his accomplishments as the protector of the kingdom."
Pigs attack and kill a Chinese farmer
Pigs attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, named only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and covered blood near a stem on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou region, as reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig in a pig’s pose on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Region, China.
According to him, he had traveled with his uncle from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead and saw that a door in a nearby pig’s mouth was open.
He said that inside the alley there had been a big mouth filled with blood.
According to the report, a court investigation confirmed that the 250 kg gilt had killed the farmer.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," said the uncle, with the last name "Wu", at the Guiyang Evening News News.
A security camera took Yuan to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else was attacked while police collected evidence on the ground.
According to news, Yuan’s family and market owners have discussions about the benefits of his death.
There are recorded examples of pigs attacking people, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig hung a farmer by a tractor until his wife put the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that their blood tastes can arouse aggression.
“ They’re just playing.
They'd like to snap and be curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the respect that belongs to them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring a great deal of relief to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the strength of Hurricane Rosa declines as it crosses the cooler seas of northern Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a great deal of relief that could cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next days.
Rosa became a class 1 hurricane with a wind intensity of 136 miles per hour, at 5 o’clock in the morning, on Sunday, and was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will head north on Sunday.
At the same time, the formation of the Pacific Ocean is submerged, and it will head east towards the west coast of the United States, so when Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, there will be a large tropical storm in the north into the southwest of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical rake will be mixed with the approaching depression that will result in large and widespread precipitation across the southwest in the next days.
Local rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm may result in dangerous rapid flooding, soil movement and possible desert steps.
A large tropical rake will produce up to 5 to 10 cm of output over an hour in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of output is expected in some locations in the southwest, especially in the vast majority of Arizona states.
There is a possibility of rapid floods with worsening conditions due to the distribution of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised against going out into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Great rain can turn the tides into torrential torrents, and thunderstorms can cause a storm and a blizzard.
The nearest site will carry a local spill in certain areas at the southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of the result which could cause slight movement on the soil and the neck on the road.
This is the first occurrence of the region during the rainy season.
A number of distributed tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before precipitation spreads over the larger area late on Monday and Tuesday.
A major outcome will spread over four states on Tuesday and last for Wednesday.
Great heat changes can be expected in all parts of the United States, as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical is still quite warm.
Sometimes this can cause a great amount of heat over a short distance of distance.
A very good example of a great difference in heat in the United States on Sunday was seen.
There is almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and resuspend themselves.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern parts of the United States will have a warm beginning of October with temperatures around 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C] or more from the plains of the south to the northeast.
The temperature could reach 25 degrees Fahrenheit [25 ° C.] in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees Fahrenheit [6 ° C.] above average.
Our long - term weather predictions indicate that the average temperature in the United States in the early part of the month of October is very high.
Over 20 million people were interviewed over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Justice, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual offense that was supposed to have occurred in the ’ 90 ’ s.
At the same time, the political situation continued, and TV stations interrupted a regular program to publish the latest news on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona, proposed a bill for the FBI to investigate the charges for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trial than the 20,4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company measured the average viewing of the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In general, Nielsen is also in trouble with measuring the audience in the offices.
To put this into context, this audience is similar in size to that of a football or Oscar Award.
According to Nielsen, most people watched the interviews that took place all day long on Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million, and their views have supported the appointment of Kavanaugh.
ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the focal point of the festival on Friday.
After the office of this congressman of the Republica group announced that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS captured images of the protestors calling him on Friday morning when he tried to enter the elevator to get a meeting with the Judiciary Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while the blizzards rained over him in a live broadcast at CNN.
One woman said: “I am standing right here right in front of you. ”
"Do you think he's telling people the truth?"
People told him: “You have power while so many women stand powerless. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a declaration, and before closing the elevator door, he said that he would express himself more at the meeting of the committee.
The cable and television stations all had a live broadcast later when the Judicial Committee decided whether or not to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate.
Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee next week, but the minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake became convinced in part after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, Senator of the Democratic Party.
Flake made her decision after a conversation with Coon and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's votes changed dramatically, as it was evident that the Republicans did not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has given permission to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, UK Prime Minister, accused critics of "being in a political game" for Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, Prime Minister, accused her of criticizing her plan to withdraw from the European Union to be a political player for the future of Britain and undermine its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will be attending the Conference of the Education Party in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was published next to her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, was given the so-called Chequers Plan on Brexit and said that the suggestion that Britain and the European Union should charge customs duties on each other would be 'completely loathsome'.
The Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU player's death
The police have arrested one suspect in the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
At the age of 20, Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for charges of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson and said that Sims had lost his glasses during the raids.
According to WAFB, CBS’ sister company, the police found the glasses on the ground and said they had found the Simpson DNA from them.
Police say Simpson confessed to having shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a guarantee of a sum of 350,000 dollars.
The judge's office in East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death is gunshot into the head and into the neck.
The authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Department, the police department of the police, the Southern University University Police Department, and the local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of LSU’s sports, thanked law enforcement for “their zeal and their search for righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two - foot [2 m] advance grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and scored 2.6 points each game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach, Will Wade, said that the team was “comforted” and“ in shock” because of Wayde’s death.
"This is something you worry about all the time," said Wade.
Volcano spills ashes over Mexico City
Ash from Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (The National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after an increase in activity in the gorge and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24 - hour period.
The center was monitored by vibration and shaking from the volcano.
Social media images showed a thin layer of ashes on car windows in the vicinity of Mexico, such as in Xochimilco.
Physicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 70 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter River crossed central Mexico in September 2017.
The Mount of Fire, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with the Catalan separatists just before the birthday of an independent vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independent Protestants accepted the papers, and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of masked segregates stoned riot police with eggs and threw powder paint that formed a dark dust cloud on the streets, which was usually filled with other tourists.
Later in the day, conflicts broke out, and police used bats to control the fight.
“ We don’t forget and don’t forgive, ” cried a group of divorced people for several hours while their opponents cried out against “Long live Spain. ”
Fourteen needed attention because of the minor harm they suffered in the protests, according to the local media.
The independence of the region continues to be strained one year after the referendum payment of October 1 was declared illegal by the authorities of Madrid, but it was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters opted for independence, but participation was poor, since most of those opposed to separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the elections in various local elections.
A group of independents had stayed overnight on Friday to prevent protests to support the country’s police.
The protest march took place, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrician, participated in the protests of his divorced wife and said that he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but limited victory in regional elections last December, the Catalonian independent groups have found it difficult to keep steam this year, since many of the best - known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention for trial because of their role in the organisation of the vote and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who protested in support of the police, said that both states had encouraged the conflict.
"The tension is growing all the time," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and have been waiting for trial since late last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
"My message in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return to democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government use," he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven to a house
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years of age, have been arrested after returning to Londonderry’s house.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot at the vehicle.
Menace scores for 1-0 Livingston victories against Rangers
Dolly Menga won the Livingston victory
The Livingston team, who came from the lower division, came to Rangers in an open shield, and Steven Gerrard suffered another loss in 18 games as the executive director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and the team Gary Holt's is now in second place with the Hibernian.
The Gerrard team has not yet won out in the top section of this season and is playing against Hearts, which are eight points ahead of top, the next Sunday.
For this game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the European Union on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the six - win division, and Holt’s principal coach has not had to experience any loss since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against non-bitless guests
The Holts team should have been long before it scored a goal, but their directness caused Rangers great trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after slipping through the defense to receive a bald transmission from Graig Halkett across the field.
The hosts had Rangers play in front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause trouble to the guests in the right places.
And that was how the goal was scored.
Rangers got an extra kick, and Livingston worked to create a goal opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who accepted a shipment and scored from the middle of the whiting.
At that point, Rangers had mastered the ball, but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper, did not have to work hard.
So it continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow fired from the target after a visit from Livingston.
Spears were constantly found in the Viitateig Livingston but were kicked from, and two demands for a whistling -- by Halkett's defense against the viceroy Glenn Middleton, and one by hand -- were dismissed.
"Gorgeous" for Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and finale for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to live up to all expectations on their way.
Their style of play and their team has hardly changed anything since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves much commendation for having mixed up from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the director was tremendously good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes all the time.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far ahead of expectations.
They were not able to complete their applications and only once managed to open up half of the locals, so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers, who are now in the middle of the ward.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
It was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations of NATO.
Differences have arisen between these issues, such as human rights, media freedom and the entry of Turkey into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but the number of supporters in her area could be seen by her president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard and condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of German governments to invite him to the land.
The two protestors reflect the controversy of this guest, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Conflict in Deptford: A bicycle driver killed himself in a car crash
A cyclist killed his life in a car in London.
The conflict came near the peaks of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a common street in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 p.m., in British local time.
The driver stopped the car and the paramedics gave attention, but the man died in an accident.
A few months after another cyclist died, a driver drove off to Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident site.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest associates know.
The road has been closed and the roads have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were wounded in riots
Six prison inmates were injured when riots broke out in a men’s security prison, as reported by a prison office.
The riot broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. to British local time on Sunday and still rage.
Special officials have been called to the area to try to control the riots involving eight prisoners and are only in one of the prison's branches.
The guards received attention because of minor facial injury in the field.
A spokesman for the Department of Prison Affairs said: “Specially trained prison officials have been called out to deal with events in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have received care for injury.
There is no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars and bars."
Over 500 prisoners are imprisoned in Long Lartin, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June it was announced that the jailer had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And last October, a police officer was called to the site to deal with a serious disturbance in peace, where workers with billiard bullets were attacked.
The Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid floods (dryer areas could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical hump to cross Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remains of the Rosa hurricane cross the southwest, with a risk of rapid flooding.
The country's weather office has already issued rapid flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and west Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rose will cross Phoenix directly on Tuesday and arrive late on Monday with an outcome.
The Phoenix Weather Station stated on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes were able to maintain their strength to be classified as tropical storms or submergements less than 200 miles [320 km] away from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 64 km away from the Arizona border."
The last predictions from the Hurricane Center predict 5-10 cm of output, with a single output of up to 12 inches [15 cm] in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
The result is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other regions of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with an individual outcome of up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of being in rapid floods, the outcome of Rosa could be a blessing because there is a great drought in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drying Authority, there is at least a very high drought to over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest class," according to news from weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rose will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning at a maximum wind intensity of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler seas in the Pacific Ocean and thus diminishes its power.
It is therefore expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday or Monday night.
In some areas of Mexico, there is a potential for great results, with a significant risk of flooding.
"The result is expected to reach 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and to the northwest of Sonora, with a probability of up to 25 cm of output," said a report from weather.com.
Rose will then head north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach Arizona’s border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical hump, then continue up through Arizona and arrive to southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The most likely threat from Rosa or its remains is a major disaster in Baja California, northwest of Sonora and southwest of the U.S. desert region, ” said the National Hurricane Center.
This outcome is expected to result in life - threatening rapid floods and movements of soil in the desert, and in mountain terrain.
The Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Homicide Arrests
Three teenage players and a 20 - year - old have been arrested for attempted murder, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The adolescent was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady. ”
One 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police have been waiting for witnesses who might have phone recordings of what happened to them.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was “feeling evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote which rejects the unmerciful and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “feeling evil and anger ” from the Democratic Party out of his entire process of nomination.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, where he strongly denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her several decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed to the committee on his accusations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans would have seen the genius and skill and courage of Kavanaugh the other day. ”
"A vote for confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote confirming one of today's most clever lawyers, a lawyer with an excellent record as a public official," he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican supporters taking part in the mid - term reviews.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not volunteering, but I'm really doing it," he said.
“That’s why I’m going all over the world to fight for great providers.”
Trump argued that democrats were working “to slow down and stop. ”
The first key vote on the floor of the Department of Elders on the appointment of Kavanaugh should be made no later than Friday, according to the assistant of the leaders of the Republic in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and a tidal wave in Indonesia, and likely many dead will rise
At least 384 died, and many were washed away when a huge wave hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and a flood hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves fell on the beach at sundown, and many people washed out on the sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The wave was formed by an earthquake of 7.5 points in Richter.
“When the flood wave was formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster agency, at an information conference in Jakarta.
“The flood wave didn’t come alone, she pulled cars, trees, houses, she fell on everything in the country,” Nugroho said, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] before it hit the beach.
Some climbed up a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photographs from the air, published by the disaster agency, showed many ruined buildings and shops, twists, and broken bridges, and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the beach on Saturday.
The order of the earthquakes was found in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia’s foundation for food and technology, declared that the energy released from the great tremor on Friday, would have been about 200 times greater than that of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, at the end of the long and narrow floods, could have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damage was “significant” and that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls, and hotels had collapsed.
The body of a few victims was found trapped in wrecked buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the destruction and property damage could be more than 300 km [300 km] north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the surface of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely down and no information is received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but may be much worse," said the Red Cross.
The organization was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting it know that a flood wave had swept over Palu, even though public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published on social media, a person could shout from the upper floor of buildings to warn the people on the street below that a flood wave was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tidal wave hits the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused powerlessness that hindered the communication of Palu and made relief work difficult for the authorities.
The army has begun sending relief aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airports have only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed in October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit the refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people who have died is over 800, depending on a tidal wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in tent cities set up in the park outside their offices, and destruction was on their way, according to Mr. Dozeba.
"People said they saw many houses completely destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helping groups have started hard relief work, but some have complained that foreign relief workers with a high level of expertise are hindered from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and staff can only begin to arrive if the accident area is declared a disaster zone.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a local accident area," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster zone, we can open up to foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell on Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing kept in the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miraculous stories that shed hope for the depressing headlines that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, trainer of the Indonesian glider, had been the trainer of two now missing gliders for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were locked up in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
"As a person with a long experience in floating, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news came from the floating group that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message in despair to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, on the other hand, showed only a grey sign, instead of a blue one.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he said.
Stealers steal $26,750 when filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink, who were filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, as reported by the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been emptying an ATM in the entertainment area and was spending more money on it, said police officer Dennis McCarthy.
When he was in his job, another man came “running behind the Brink worker ” and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but the police did not give up how many were involved.
Those who might have information about the suspects are asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapist Kanye West is going to change his name--in Ye.
He announced the change to Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The formerly known being as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change will happen to his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi on the show, but she stopped for “emotional reasons, ” said the producer.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortcut to his present name.
“ I think “ye” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” said West earlier in the year when he spoke the name on his record to the radio director Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and to just Ye--be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The record is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has also written his name both with and without bandstrings and loudst letters.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the army against general citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military force against general citizens; now the silent land will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloodthirsty students.
On Saturday in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised: “Never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers launched a peaceful protest march on the square and dropped up to 300 people at a time when the left - wing movements of the students were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by providing monthly support to all students and opening up more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of study opportunities attract young people to criminal activity.
The United States should double the artificial funds
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in this field, says the inventor and fake user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after the various branches of the U.S. government announced artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it focuses on being in the first place of creation with artificial intelligence prior to 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of money spent on artificial research, given that all other countries are so much further behind the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” said Lee.
A doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major discovery of artificial intelligence will be made in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, ” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Innovation Ventures, which invests in Face++, one of China’s leading artificial intelligence companies.
He worked on an artificial intelligence system in the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in the United States at Othello, and later he was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technical competitions held by the U.S. authorities, such as the military robotics competition, and asked when the next race would be held to identify the next pioneers.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get strength from the government, said Lee.
“It’s not China that takes to heart its main ideas, but the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired engineers from colleges to work on artificially-diagnosed last year.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
“I feel that those who have a doctorate in artificial science should be granted a residence permit automatically, ” he said.
China’s Congress published its future intelligence plan in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Institute provides funds to university - based students, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar official institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it invests over $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, a U.S. law that was designed to provide a safety committee on artificial intelligence has not survived for months.
The Macedonians vote in national vote on whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia chose to vote on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to the ‘Northern Macedonia Republic’ in an attempt to resolve decades of differences with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia and argues that its neighbours’ name in the north is equivalent to their territory and therefore refused entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June, which was based on the new name, but nationalist opposers argue that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of people of Macedonia of slave origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote and campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote payment to be considered valid.
The question of the electoral system is this: ‘Do you want to go to NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ’
The supporters of the change of name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a fair price for Macedonia to join the alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough congressmen have said that they will follow it and bind it into law.
The change of name would require the approval of two thirds of the Congress.
The committee said that nothing unusual had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last congressional election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old voter in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son, Dushko, paid their votes in the Macedonia referendum on whether to change the country’s name, but this would facilitate its entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the Skopje Congress, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of tents built by those who would ignore the vote.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, do not go through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to agree with us as Macedonia, we can turn another way like China or Russia and become part of a European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will provide the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the proportion of the unemployed is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after paying his vote.
He said that agreement would be “confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday from the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the national vote, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another TV TV poll showed that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would say yes.
In order for the national vote to be considered valid, the attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure to approve the vote could mean the first serious shock to the government’s policy, which is in line with the Western countries, since it took place in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through every defense Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took their defenses lightly with Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal at 65 minutes.
The Argentine forwarder received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the search.
He sprang past the three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four greenwashed defenders.
He got past one defenseman and then ran away from a few more people just like Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forwarder used the first contact inside the bar to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, the goaltender Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
"Aguero has some foot problems," said Pep Guardiola, City Executive Director, to reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored a mark at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the first blue mark in the prime league game.
That's what happened in 29 minutes.
Aguero was sent far into the field of Brighton on that visit.
He sent a magnificent long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent Sterling to the distant pole.
He sent the ball to the net just before he ran off.
City is playing against Hoffenheim in the Championships at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play an exclusive game against Rockies
Since the Nationals have been excluded from the playoffs, there was little reason to force another start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to get to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to make the finals, but they have a single-game lead over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Department.
Rockies got at least a "wildcard" seat with his 5-2 victory at the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach its first title.
“ Even though we play free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver as well as the other team will certainly play their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete under such circumstances?"
Nationals are still going to announce who will be the first to caster in Sunday’s play, but it is believed that they will have Scherzer throw in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was about to start the 34th time, took a training session on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his regular Sabbath.
This right-hand pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 blows in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican supporters in the mid - term reviews.
“Everything is at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big... I don't volunteer, but I do. That's why I go all over the country to fight for great providers," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democracies, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to gain power and control, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that democrats were working on “stopping and blocking. ”
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, saying to the Democrats, "that they are angry and evil and cruel and untrue."
He named Senator Diane Feinstein, a leading democrat on the Senate Committee, by name, and was answered with a loud voice from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who read the document?
Ha, what.
No, look, I waited in one... it was really bad body expression, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He does not tolerate those who express their mind
When the activists of my group chose to address me, it hardly came as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of many congressmen of the working class who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan Ryan, my associate congressman, received similar treatment, for she strongly protested prejudice against Jews.
In my case, I had the opportunity to make comments because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issue was the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inconclusive and effective. ”
During my eight - year career as a congressman of the working class, Friday meetings have been the most frequent.
Unfortunately, there are not many meetings today and the promise of 'milder and better' politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views have not passed in the Workers ’ Party and that all opinions are judged as acceptable to the leaders of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I previously thought had similar political views to mine, began to expect me to take a complete turn and support opinions that I had never previously agreed on, whether it was a matter of national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly -- and then little matter what I say -- there is a bit of an outrage at the community media that is called after my expulsion, central government denied, and told me I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my associates, since most of the speeches I get are mostly political.
I admire professionalism and confirm those who have to endure the pitfalls of sexual or prejudiced insults every day but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing things in this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers ’ Party should take care of tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of a church, and with any lack of confidence or change in choice, the class is becoming more and more narrow.
I’ve had many advices in the last two years about being low on me, not being too loud, and it would be “all right ” with me.
But I did not choose to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Working Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my schoolroom in a state of degradation, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in town government or in Congress.
I have never hidden my political views, nor the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country is heading for Brexit, which will harm the home, business and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy loyally with the leaders of the Workers' Party.
But my only message, which I want to send from me, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those who are within my district, whether or not they are members of the Workers' Party: I serve you proudly and I promise that no threat of deviation or political expulsion will deter me from doing what I consider to be for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team of Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchpoints might have shaken the final result somewhat, but there's no doubt that Ayr had won the victory in this acute play of the day in the Tennent's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list and one of the ten remaining undefeated.
Finally, their protection and better use of opportunities made the locals more victorious, and Peter Murchie, a trainer, was fully entitled to be happy.
“We’ve had strong opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Observers deserve commendation, they took advantage of their opportunities better than we do,"
Mark Grant Anderson came across Ayr to the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned the search around, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased to lead Ayr with hell before he scored with a kick just before half a game and then touched the touchdown and put Ayr over 17-5 in half.
However, Melrose started a second half of his life, and Patrick Anderson’s touchdown, after Baggot turned his application back, reduced the difference to five points.
Then, after Climo turned his application, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, then got the yellow card and Melrose used himself again to be a man over with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard call.
However, locals came back strong, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for gaining Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the Ayr search, after an extra kick.
Climo turned the application back, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick David Amrstrong from the pastry and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the fifth touchdown of the team.
Star the Still Game elements ready for a new career in the restaurant manager
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game players, seems ready to move to the restaurant branch after the discovery of his appointment as manager of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC games, which he writes and plays in with his old partner from the entertainment business, Creek Hemfill.
The two have announced that the future ninth series of events will be the last, and it seems that Klauf has plans for Craiglang’s life.
According to official files, he's managing director of Aktribmorn Limited.
The player did not want to say anything about the story, but the author of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kläng would be a participant in the "living restaurant business" of Glasgow City.
'The sea is ours': the shoreless country of Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen its way back to the Pacific
Marines are guarding the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Fleet stations from Titicaca to the Amazon are marked the slogan: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Throughout the 19th century, throughout Bolivia, the reminder of the shoreline that was lost to Chile in a bloody battle remains in a fresh memory, along with the desire to revisit the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the unifying spirit, and the restlessness, and of course waits for the ruling with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people of Bolivia will observe the rulings of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague will decide Bolivia in favor of their requirement to grant Bolivia access to it after decades of difficult conversation.
Monday’s decision is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country’s Indian family, who will have a debated struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
However, some analysts suspect that the court ruled in favor of Bolivia, and that doing so would not change much.
The court, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to land from Sile and has decided that the decision will not affect the outcome of the discussion.
The fact that the court’s ruling came only six months after the final hearing indicated that the case “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that over the past four years, Bolivia has not been a cause for improvement, but has caused the country to retreat.
"The current Bolivian government has stolen the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
Morale’s militant words have diminished the goodwill of Sile, she thought.
Bolivia and Sile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Sile” and the opportunity to“ put an end to differences that go back 139 years in time, to the benefit of both countries,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this subject as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past. ”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear weapons unless it can be trusted by the United States.
Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a Singapore meeting between the leaders of the nations.
His comment is now that Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State, seems to be resuming talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dreams” to maintain that continued trade unions and US protests against the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever kneel down North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes clear action first to take down his nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there is great doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of big headwear that will come to fashion shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or if you want to be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a number of strange hats in their oversized SS19 lines in the fashion field that fascinated the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of extremely inconvenient hats has been published on Instagram during the summer, and these designers have shown their innovative creations on fashion shows.
The main work of Valentino was a large light - brown hat with a wide coat that resembled feathers and covered the head of the models.
Of other oversized components, watermelons were made of precious gemstones, hazelnut hats, and even pineapple, but these items were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a number of strange masks, just at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had assembled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One mask resembled a suffocation device with a respirator and a glass eye, while another looked like a melting ice in a bread form.
If you want to toll on that bitch, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come in a ‘La Bomba’, a straw hat with over 60cm of large coats, which has adorned the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the very improbable hat, seen in all the community media, was the inspiration for another big accessory that appeared in the fashion field — a neck - of - the - beach bag that was almost as big and the swimweared model that carried it.
The orange ostrich box, with a strawboard and a white leather handle, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 dress line Jacquemus during the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a famous stylist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in the fashion stores for the next summer - where the designer has had such an impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demands for accessories. ”
John Edward: Tuna Skills Are Needed for World Citizens
Private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding results of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still supported by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) defending them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further secondary education, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizen.
As a teacher who can put together and teach by specialized study lists, we see that new languages continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other lands.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentages of students who pass private school tests.
68 percent of foreign - language students received the A grade.
The data collected from 74 schools within the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the grade A in mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners, and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received the grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as a necessary skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as selection, are placed in the same position as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons stated by employers that employment was difficult to manage was 17 percent due to a lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future work.
As more and more jobs require knowledge of languages, this skill is needed in a global world.
No matter what career people choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future, but it is a skill that lasts for their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a large - weight person an advantage over the competitors.
According to a 2013 survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the British language, 75 percent of them were unable to speak another language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two characters a percent, or 15 percent.
Hence, it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multitudes, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better opportunity to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical new languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for Britain when looking forward to 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools commit themselves to providing a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
There is no denying that at this time, in a global business environment, language remains essential for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In reality, modern - day languages should really be viewed as “international know - how in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, variety, and superiority to Scottish youths.
I'll have a beer faire.
John Edwards, Chairman of the Scottish Private School Board
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Coach Lakers, has announced that James will be playing on Sunday in the opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
The number of minutes he will play has not yet been determined.
"It'll be longer than a minute and shorter than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the start of the season.
“In this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare, ” he said.
Timing for Trump's election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the confirmation of his election to the new Supreme Court Judge has been suspended, Trumpad is proposing to build up support for the next mid-term reviews, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when votes are voted in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to start at 7:00 p.m. on the east coast tonight, Saturday September 29th, 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia on the web below through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will refer the case to Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who was tense because of the charges of sexual harassment, and the Senate's vote to confirm him as a judge for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the charges.
But the main goal of Trump’s meetings is to help the Republicans get better paces, which await difficult elections in November.
Thus, Trump’s election campaign announced that these five meetings held next week were designed to “fill volunteer and supporter zeal that the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and Congress, ” according to Reuter’s newsroom.
"Chairmanship is so necessary for the President's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible now that a careful campaign period is about to begin," said a dissenting speaker from Trump's campaign at Reuters' newsroom.
Tonight, the meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh will report it, ” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday meeting will be the second visit of Trump to West Virginia this month, but it won with over 40 percent of this state's revenue in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the volunteer Republican in West Virginia to the Senate, but he's down in the polls.
“It is not good for Morrissey that the President needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” said Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters’ newsroom.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States Team Shows a Fighting Will to Keep the Hope Alive for the Individual Competition Sunday
After three one - sided laps, the fourth game, which was on Saturday afternoon, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Prosperity swings are sports that have been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the competition like this.
Where would they say that success now lies?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now it’s four points, so the success is more on our side now, I guess,” said Jordan Spieth as he set off in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the lead four points ahead, with an additional twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have a little wind in their sails and they can hope for many things, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played extensively from the surface and leads by his example.
As the circle progressed, the shout of applause increased, and he put down an important puncture to take all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below two.
His cupbearer, who won them in the game at the 15th hole, received a similar shout of joy, a cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the American team still has a hope of victory.
"You just have to dive deep and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to collect points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but exciting European couple have won four games out of four and cannot do anything wrong.
“ Moliwood ” was the only couple who had a bad afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid having a bad time on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine - hole field on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, who sits the sun over the Le Golf National field.
It would be best for both to do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swan dug into a hole that they never managed to scratch.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The quadruples and the quadruples are so exciting to watch in the vicinity because of the interaction between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a play schedule can change at one point.
Europe has played better as a team to this point and has a considerable advantage for the final day, but this four - game round also showed that the American team has the will to fight that some had doubted it, especially the other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good head start for the end day of the Ryder Cup after a four-ball and a four-game Saturday, with the 10-6 lead against the United States.
The starring starring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who were in trouble, and received four points at the Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to get back the prize cup, which it lost at the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the American team in the four - ball game of the morning and won 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater opposition to the quadruples and won two games but failed to win the score.
Jim Furyk’s team required eight points from 12 people on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who shared the nickname "Molliwood" after a wonderful weekend, are just another couple who win four points from the first four of their games in the history of Ryder the Cup.
After winning Woods and Patrick Reed in the quadriplegic game, they showed a lot of teamwork and won off Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius once in a while, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four - ball games and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four-ball game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik's Stenson in the quadruples and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka--who are in the first and third seats on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go all the way to the end of this mild and hospitable day, southwest of Paris.
A triple winner in the golf championship, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quadruples after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of Ryder’s cup that a team has won four points apart at the start of an individual race, even though Furyk’s team would only need a tie to continue the cup.
However, after being the second best for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says one-sided disarmament 'impossible' without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the US that a continuing trade ban only undermined their confidence in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take its nuclear weapons down one side in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly of the United States that North Korea had taken “substantial measures to show goodwill” in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have seen no corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country's security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take our nuclear weapons down one side first."
Although Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the "step-changed" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his declaration appeared to be exceptional insofar as he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament purely out as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President-in-Office of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim promised to work on the "nuclear armaments of Korea" and Trump issued a promise to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to put a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict commercial ban against North Korea.
“The United States demands that ‘nuclear disarmament takes place first’ and increases the pressure by using a trade ban to achieve its own goals, even protesting the declaration to end the war, ” said Ri.
“ It’s just the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us to think that a trade union can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continuing business struggles increase our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader spoke about at the U.S.A. earlier this week.
Instead of talking about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the past five months, the Minister added: "If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this was not the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula."
In spite of this, Ri’s speech was very different from his speech last year when he said at the General Assembly that it was inevitable to launch rockets from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after Trump, the Devil’s President, called Kim “a rocketman” a suicide attempt.
Last year, Trump threatened to "bring" North Korea, but this year he praised Kim of the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still a great deal of work to be done and that trade unions would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame in this regard, saying: “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On the other hand, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council: “The Security Council’s trade alliance must continue until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and is confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase the North Korean trade alliance from 2006 in order to close the funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and missile plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline at U.S. General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to take down missile areas and a nuclear station if the United States resorted to 'corresponding action'.
He said that Kim had told himself that the “corresponding actions” he was looking for were security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to resist the growing tendency of students to stay awake and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
Research revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of self - care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of dormitory medicine at Harvard Medical School, and an expert at Brigham and the women’s hospital, designed the course and thought that it saw the first species in the United States.
After giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning, he came up with the idea of taking a course.
“ At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and asked: “Why is this first said to me in my final year?
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first course of study this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help students in their education and sports and even contribute to their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and director of health services at the school, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were very sleepless over the week.
The duration of the study is an hour and includes various interactive projects.
In one part, there is a picture of a room where students click on a cup of coffee, window curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In part, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that favors those who stay awake and learn all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Assuring that sufficient sleep is achieved with good quality should be a secret weapon for students to resist stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even to avoid getting fattened, because lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old professor of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler put together the course, but he sat one of the professor's briefs last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they begin studying at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider adjusting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to awaken them, and bear in mind the harmful effects of blue light produced by electronic displays and LED light, which may confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark of Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Mr. Rangers still had difficulties in his outing when Stevens Gerrards had to deal with a 1-0 loss on Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first victory at the site after their victory at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's only second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is in the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before half a game, and Ranger’s team seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers now fall to the sixth place, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only behind the Hibernian in a marked contrast.
Rangers may have had further problems after the lineer Calum Spence had to receive attention for head injury after some items were thrown into him from the field half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and got off in the first place in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, adhered to the same Livi 11 installation that reached a stage of Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased to see how well - trained members of his team held out over the opposition.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it got.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first shipment from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he missed.
A long sidekick from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense partner, shot past the remote pole.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than believe in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales truly felt that when he and Steven Lawless joined forces, he should have had a hell of a hell of a lot, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian appeal.
Rangers only scored two shots in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former target Ibrox, did not have to have much to defend a baldness from Lassana Coulibary and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi had come in 34 minutes despite the fact that the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, even just because of their perseverance.
Rangers failed again to do something of a long extra effort from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmed down and chose to send to Menga, who then scored easily.
Gerrard took his advice half-way and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibary, and the change had an effect almost immediately when the rear guard came in to Morelos, but Kelly quickly retorted and rushed forward to close the shot.
However, Livingston continued to trick the guests into playing exactly the same game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long shipment on their feet.
The Holts team could have increased their leadership on the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs the opportunity before Lithgow ran to the mark from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Ranger's deputy, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson dismissed it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and AFRAM... this is the day that future geologist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and the invention eventually led to a device called the Geiger measuring device.
The Geiger meter has gained a steady position in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 'Bells of Coronado' film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
A man: “What the hell is this? ”
Rogers says: “This is Geiger’s measure, used to detect radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these hearing aids on you, you can hear the effect from the atoms because of radioactivity in the rocks."
Evans: “It sure does break now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name survives.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them at the laboratory
Then they can "see" proteins, which are common in many cancer cells, and are then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months and the vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory so that they can “see” proteins called HER2 and are found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that the vaccine is highly effective. ”
HER2 “let various types of cancer stop growing,” including breast, ovary, lung, and rectum cancer, said Berzofsky, professor.
A similar procedure in which immune cells are removed from patients and the “tender” of attacking cancer cells has been effective in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long discourse in support of Trump and carried a MAGA cap after appearing on the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well.
After a lengthy talk, Kanye West, a student in Saturday Night Live, praised President Donald Trump and said that he would present himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke against the Democrats for a long time and repeated his support to Trump.
“I’ve talked so often to white people who say, “How can you like Trump, he’s a race hater?
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have long since moved from the United States," he said.
The SNL started with a key, where Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee for the cause of Christine Blasey Ford’s charges of sexual harassment.
Although the long-haul West had not been sent out, the recording of it was put on a social media by Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the tape.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received a bad reception backstage because of his hat selection.
“I was bullied in the back.
They said to me: “Don’t go up there with that cap. ”
They bullied me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the deep hole? ”
Try love."
According to Variety, his comments were made by an audience of at least two, and SNL actors seemed disgraceful, and one audience said to the paper: “There was a silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to join the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: TAKE CHOICE FOR THE VIEW OF THE MOUTH. ”
But on Twitter Karen Hunter said that West was simply being “him himself, and that’s wonderful. ”
“ But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) whom I feel I was supporting and spreading ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now “the formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He's not the first artist to change his name and feet in Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the musical myth Prince Theorem, who later changed his name into a symbol and called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticizes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of HBO, the Crown Games.
The 31 - year - old player, however, has criticized the model of the male hero, saying that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic malehood during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion from the Crown Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong opinions ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, I think at the moment - what has gone wrong with the masculinity?"
"What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic malehood, due to very male TV characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that make young boys feel as if they must be a certain type of man?
I think it's one of the most important questions in the world -- how do we do this?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also admitted during the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Games after the series was similar to the next summer and said that he had received “plenty of battlefields and horses. ”
From November on, Kit will be reproducing a picture by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a movie producer and his kidnapper brother.
The player recently said that the best thing about playing at the Crown Games was to meet his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these parts, so that they would give me my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygridte, Jon Snow's lover, who Kit played in these Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018, on the Lesli family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS.
Health authorities say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the administration of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with the HIV virus has fallen to almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan region conference.
However, the number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has increased by 100,000 from one year to the next.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but significant discrimination against LGBT people is still reported.
Due to conservative values in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sexual activity with other people will eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access for all to HIV medicines as part of its strategy to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from the Senate members of the Republic, criticises “hazardous lies” and “conspiracy teachings”
On Saturday, Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information on their Wikipedia pages by three Senate members.
The democrat from Los Angeles said that these claims came from “superrighteous ” extremists and websites.
"Lies, lies, and other lousy lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published included the addresses and phone numbers of Utah Utah Utah U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the hearings of the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, for the charges of sexual harassment.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Content pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were linked to the Waters office and published information about one of its employees, as reported by Capitol Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and pure lies," continued Waters.
“My employee – what personal information and security are now at risk because of these false accusations – did not in any way take responsibility for this information breach.
This unreasoning accusation is utterly false, and is a pure lie."
Waters ’ statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ This indicates that she does not have the mood to sit on a council.
When someone is accused for no reason, do not react with anger.
It must not be opposed.
This is not to be asked for reasons of accusation.
It must be calm and considerate."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of a democrat against Judge Kavanaugh, who said critics had seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the provocative Republics against Waters in the mid - term reviews, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"A big deal if it's true," he shuddered.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “notified these false claims by the appropriate authorities and law enforcement.
“We will ensure that the guilty are found,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all the acts that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees. ”
Film review for Johnny English Strikes again - spy image with Rowan Atkinson proves to be small
It is now customary to look for the Brexit references in all new forms where Britain is concerned, and this seems to be part of the resurgence of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with the image Johnny English and just woke up again in 2011 with the image Johnny English Reborn.
Will this chance of satire tell us how clearly miserable we are a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether it is or not, Johnny English’s obscurity, greed, and clumsiness have been renewed for the second time to ruin everything — his name shows above all that he is designed for demonstrations in non - English - speaking lands.
He is, of course, the clever secret service man who pretends to have fascinating personal charms but is a bit mixed with Clouseau, dass by Mr. Bean and a little scrap of the man who played one note for the song Chariot of Fire at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious world citizen who once played by Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left everything in confusion.
There is one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English go to a helicopter dressed in a medium - aged bear, and the choppers rolled into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his ability to laugh, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now when “more serious ” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also come up with hilarious jokes.
The joke seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and I felt that the fairy tale Johnny English had had less imaginative and focused than the silent tricks of Atkinson in Mr. Bean’s fake.
The ever - present feature of the picture is that Britain is in a lot of trouble.
A computer hacker has broken into Britain's secret spy network and revealed the identity of all British spies, much to the dismay of the spy who is on the watch - but there Kevin Eldon is unfortunately in too little role.
This is the final piece for the prime minister, who is a proud and controversial person, and already in a great deal of trouble because of enormous political unhappiness: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind of Theresa May, but the manuscript is not worth many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already sat down on a sacred stone.
And that's where Johnny English himself comes from, now the headmaster of some fine school, but also gives a secret lesson in how to be a spy: Here are some funny jokes that English offers at a spy school that reminds of the movie School of Rock.
Called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, Bough, his former long - fatigued partner, who was reunited with Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that powerful role Vicki Pepperdine does not quite let his light shine.
The spy who fucks up everything in Her Majesty's service has now returned to the girt and meets the high-risk woman Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister enjoys the charms of a billionaire in the field of technology, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their rampage: they set off in a fine French restaurant disguised as servants, they make trouble as they smuggle into the luxury nest of Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use spectacle glasses to explore the interior of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to be saved in that final point, but although the image is cheerful and energy-rich, there is, however, some of the baby stuff in it as a whole.
Medium content.
And just like with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't help thinking, can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The working class denies that it is preparing a four-day work week plan for the UK, with the same pay as five days a week.
The working class, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, executives want to make use of savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and they want to benefit from one extra day off.
If so, employees may enjoy three days of weekends without losing their pay.
Sources say that the idea would "match" with the group's economic plan and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, which has allowed workers to benefit from economic change.
A source from the Upper Workers ’ Party said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"The change will not take place overnight, but four days of work week is a goal that fits the approach of the group to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industrial policy of the group."
The working class would not be the first to support this idea, but the Green Party promised four days of work in its 2017 campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the entire Workers ’ Party.
The Workers ’ Party spokesman said: “Four days of work are not on the agenda of the class, and the class is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, Minister of Shadow Affairs, used the Workers ’ Party conference last week to describe his ideas about social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain control of 'unidentified leaders' and 'growth' companies.
The Minister of Shadow's plans also mean that current shareholders in hydroelectric companies may not be able to recover their entire share, since the Workers' Party's government could resort to 'death' because of alleged misdemeanors.
It has also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of companies and to create a common equity fund to provide 10 percent of the property of private companies to their employees, who could receive 500 pounds a year from them in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether an FBI study at Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Court Judge, and raises the question as to whether her findings could get the Senate members of the Republic to withdraw their support.
During a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter on the 60 - minute show of the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could reveal something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked: “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, steadfast, undisputed."
Graham’s vote, however, seems unalterable.
“ I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, ” he said, “and it would take an incredible accusation to change it.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," added Graham, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions by name could not confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I can't see that nothing new will change."
What is the International Civil Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City, an annual music event in which a series of stars will appear and with a similar policy; the end of poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the international civil festival, and tens of thousands of people will be moved to Central Park, not only to listen to music items such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end the severe poverty by 2030.
The first international civil festival in 2012 is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Powery Project), which is an international battle organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (except for those who want to pay for the VIP tickets), there was a need for audiences to complete various tasks, or “actions”, such as working on a volunteer job, e-mailing to one of the world’s leaders, telephone calls, or other valid ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, for 12 years now, in reaching its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to call for action, or is it just one so - called “smelling operation” - where people feel that they are doing something that matters by signing the online demand list or sending a message to Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters, calling for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies that amount to over $35 billion that will affect lives over 2.25 billion by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that up to now the amount of money gathered has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in Britain, who work to “help children enjoy themselves to the full, ” promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the sponsors, the governments around the world and the international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice of the past unfavourable," said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition at London's concerts in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals were sent to Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question is this: “Why do you think you can put an end to the very poor? ”
Global citizens responded: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will achieve our goal, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abduction of racial separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae. The event will be held in New York City and the participants are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports, says Minister of State
"If necessary," Washington could use the Navy to prevent power in Russia from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works at the invitation of the legal government there, was a premise to explore new markets.
"I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its southern parts," he said according to sources.
And, according to an official report, there are ways and methods to resist it.
"The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to prevent them from entering the market," he said.
Zince addressed a guest meeting at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the Voice of Energy Agency Dance, ” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach with that of Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more and less the use of energy and to replace them with others," he said, saying, "and Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcements come after Trump's management wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in Trump's administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to create a new power line, which Trump says would make Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 power supply, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion sq m], is only an economic project.
Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project has simply continued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy should not be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose supplies,” said Alexander Novak, Russian energy minister after meeting with Rick Perry, US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German Industrial Association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that the foreign kingdom was divided by our power force," said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" to present himself to the President's office in 2020, she says.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously ” to present herself to the president after the mid - term exams.
Warren confirmed that she would consider inviting herself to a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and order our government, and then a woman as a leader, too," she said, according to a report from The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will consider seriously presenting myself to the President. ”
Speaking of President Donald Trump at the meeting, Warren said that he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been rude about his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court judge.
Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course, we must have the FBI investigate before the vote is taken. ”
However, a Thursday survey shows that the majority of voters in Warren’s state do not believe that it should be offered in 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of "like" voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not be invited, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The poll showed greater support for the presentation of former Governor Deval Patrick, who claimed to support 38 percent of his potential supply, and 48 percent claimed to oppose it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for possible presidential presentation in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, senator of Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of a trauma disorder Track Palin at a campaign meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, aged 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, and I feel like other families who are affected by the stress disorder and the spiritual wounds our soldiers return home with,” she said to the audience at an election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ came back a little differently, they are tough and wonder if there is any respect for what their military and air forces and other military units have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent domestic violence and for the use of alcohol - induced weapons, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support the challenge against a new asylum seeker policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence for refuge.
According to a report from NBC News, representatives of the 18 states and the city sent in a trial report on Friday in Washington to support a policy objector.
The full name of the defendant in Grace v. Sessions' application for legal action filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were members of the gang, ” used violence, but American government officials rejected her application for refuge on July 20.
She was put in custody in Texas.
The prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems associated with gangs and domestic violence are growing, and the number of asylum seekers in the United States comes from these countries.
In 2014, the new asylum seeker revokes a decision made by the Committee on Petitions to allow unregistered immigrants who fled domestic violence to seek refuge.
Karl Racine, D.C., announced on Friday that the new policy “saw decades of federal and international law. ”
"Federal law requires a decision to be made on all applications for asylum based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule," said the Court of Justice report.
In addition, in the report, the law stated that the policy that refused immigrants for entry was harmful to the economy of the United States, claiming that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “maintain important labour force. ”
Jeff Sessions, State Attorney, ordered judges in immigration matters to stop giving shelter to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their country because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for refuge,” said Sessions in their announcement on the 11th of June.
Sanctuaries were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in the race to find survivors in Palu, who double the number of the dead
Conditions are becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son at the relief center in Pala.
“A car comes here with a body all the time.
There's a little bit of clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed homes and looking for their water - savory possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake that measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued violent aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told of how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the wall chests, I think," said Haris to the Associated Press, saying that his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Secretary of State accuses China of 'trafficking' by 'prosecution ads'
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four - page advertisement in an American newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of business between the two countries, U.S. ambassadors in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, spoke last Wednesday about the Chinese newspaper’s advertisement in the Des Moines Register, which is the most widely sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the United States congressional elections that will be held on November 6, China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to get involved in the U.S. Congressional elections marked what official U.S. representatives told Reuter’s newsroom that there was a new stage in an increasing campaign from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington are in constant business war, with new customs duties on both countries’ import products.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, China’s payrolls were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican group.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for the long term, who is exporting a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad stated in his report in the Sunday Des Moines Register that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“By spreading their propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of the love of freedom of speech of the United States and our free media by publishing a free advertisement in the Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in his article.
"However, few protestors can be found in newspaper booths on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the different opinions that the Chinese could have on the worrying economics of China, where the media are trapped under the heels of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the offer to publish ” his article, but he did not specify which magazine it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters deflect them for the mid-term reviews of the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, during the next mid - term exams, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, who has accepted charges of sexual harassment.
Very strong feelings have been felt about this matter, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted to start voting.
"There's no going back with these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School Institute at Syracuse University, at The Hill, for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the appeal of Senator Jeff Flake of the Arizona Republican Senate in the last minute for an investigation by the FBI to calm down angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened last night, they won’t forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief executive and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November Approaches! ” when they protested the Senate’s marches when the Republicans who ruled the Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and enthusiasm of the electorate will come out of all power," said Stu Rothenberg, independent of a political analyst, at the newscast.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he could be greater, especially for female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the President, than rarely choose."
The researchers predicted a setback if the Republicans urged Kavanaugh to be confirmed, even before Ford’s testimony, as she described her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, former member of the Republican National Commission, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The case is not just about the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, president of the United States Priorities, a group that helps to choose Democrats, at the news station.
On the other hand, it seems that the United States disagrees with who should believe according to testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a small majority supports the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably believed the Ford witness, while 35 percent claimed to believe, or likely testify, Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the allegations that Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, reportedly from Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh wore her genitals in front of her when they were both at a Yale University party in the 1980 ’ s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to start a spray company to fight Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the mythology, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, an open-ended project of Berners-Lee.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee, in a joke, said that the intention behind Inrupt was “the world deliberation.”
"We have to do this now," he said about the spray company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own ‘personal online data store’ or POD.
There is a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work - related devices.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it “personal selection by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, the idea is that Inrupt provides the company with access, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security firm bought by IBM, several programmers hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
From this week onward, technology developers around the world may produce their own independent software with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss with “Facebook and Google whether or not to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on their heads in one night.
"We do not ask permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday at Medium that Inrupt had “a goal to create energy in business and ecosystems that helps to protect the honesty and quality of the new website based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he's getting Inrupt on his way.
"I am full of optimism for the next period of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The victoriary cross from the first world war honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during the first world war that a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Father Bernard Vann, who held the position of chieftain of the army, received the cross in the attack on Bellenglishe and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a sniper killed him four days later, and he never learned that he had received the highest honor of the British Army.
Two of his grandparents exposed monuments about him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandfather’s sons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderfully symbolic ” that the monument was exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s veneration.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his commanding force over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under a heavy gunfire from cannons and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the firing line, and with “great courage, ” he led the line forward before attacking a cannon of his own, overcoming three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war, a sub Colonel was killed by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said that his grandfather was “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the flowering crane after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt “a great honor to participate in the parade ” and added that“ the death of a true hero is shown by the support of so many. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurra pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main program, and they were shown on live transmission all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received a surprise when the broadcast turned into a Gurra pig.
Some were dissatisfied to watch the battle all night.
One fan of Twitter described the switch to the baby as “any sort of sick joke. ”
“According to official regulations, the material was not suitable for audiences at six o’clock in the morning, so they had to switch to baby food,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communications for Bellator, when he was asked to the broadcast.
"Guy pig, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they would review their schedules and include audiences in Britain in the account in the future.
"I think when I think about the show that we could probably solve this," said Coker.
“ But there is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we cannot solve this until Sunday in our day, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the transmission was changed, a lot of text messages were sent back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was an official problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and overestimated ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “unpowerful” because of sexual orientation
The Olympic dungeon Tom Daley claims to have had feelings of inadequacy toward other people in their upbringing because of his sexual orientation, but that this encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different ” until he went to high school. ”
On the Desert Island Discs radio show on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parental role had diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual director, has taken several months off because of illness.
When he was a child, “it was not agreed in society to like both boys and girls. ”
He said: “Until today, these feelings of feeling unrewarded have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone at the end of his sexual activity.
Two times the Olympic Bronzer has been a great supporter of the LGBT, using his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would let himself be heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The World Champion three times said that he had “stunned himself ” to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar winner, who said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man goes through so much at an early age" - but he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “all his life views” had been humiliated.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize," he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than gold prizes at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was baptized in the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after having been diagnosed with cancer of the brain.
Daley said that his father had not agreed that he would die, and one of the last thing he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London in 2012--because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, diving in front of the audience at the Olympic Games, and it doesn’t feel any better, ” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song -- Proud by Heather Small -- who had inspired him to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 in British local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and the dead sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will score on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old beats again so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the race for the 12th time, which is a record, was made to sit on the class after the decision of President Jim Furyk for the matches in a four - ball game and four games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hare, as he has been so often before for the United States, the day of five times the master divides between being cheerleaders and rehearsing the plays on the field, hoping to correct what is wrong with him.
Mickelson, 48 years old, was never the one who shot directly with the hangar, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long bells often punish for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the four - point Americans take the first of 12 solo games, they get off to a good start, Mickelson’s game could change.
Fury declared trust in his man, but he could hardly say much else.
“ He completely understood the role he had today, clapped my back and took me around and said he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the famous palace, and he has been so much paid for earlier and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but so it ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the process in the Ryder Cup, which has never achieved exactly as much as other achievements on its record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losers, and 7 drawers, but Furyk said that his presence has a vague effect on the team.
“ He’s funny, he’s ironic, kind of likes to make fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“ I think the younger players liked to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf."
Thomas Bjorn, President of Europe knows that a lot of headway can disappear quickly.
European President Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good start for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dane first played in Valderrama in 1997, with five-point advantage over the Americans under the leadership of the president Seve Ballesteros, but achieved the right to win at the end of the race with the lowest possible level difference, with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep remembering that we had a lot of head start in Valderrama, we had a lot of head start in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, but just so,” said Bjorn, who is shown here, after watching the 2018 vintage, works 5-3 on Friday and Saturday and gets the 10-6 advantage on the Le Golf National field.
History will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
We'll do our best tomorrow.
Let's go do everything right.
This is not finished until all the levels are on the tablet.
We have our goal, and it's trying to win this cup, we focus on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our opponent in the other team -- the best golfer in the world."
Bejorn was delighted with how his players had coped in a difficult field and added: “I never get past myself in this.
Tomorrow's going to be different.
Tomorrow, the person’s performance is important, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything's going well, but when you play one, you're trying on everyone's talent as a golfer.
It's the message to send the players, to get the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Fury, will seek to make his players better in personal games than with partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transformation on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out “the miracle of Medinah. ”
"I remember every fucking word," he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the president in 1999, had encouraged his players on the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
As that step progresses toward building up, there is great pressure on the games in the center.
We arranged our players according to it and let them play as we think will go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half.
“I chose these players in this sequence because I think they’re going to cover all the way through,” said Bjorn about his choice of players in the individual race.
Germany’s New Warship Residual
The German Navy’s latest warship should have been built in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the first time next year for failure of systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The building of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship should have been taken into account by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the project was finished.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group that the Navy ordered in 2007 should replace the ships of the Bremen-class, which have arrived in their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful cannon, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as a hidden equipment such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use times - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these new-type warships - which are said to enable Germany to show its strength at sea - will be out of date when they are finally taken for advantage, says Die Zeit.
The F125 arrived at the news last year when the German army publicly refused to accept the flea and returned it to the Blohm & Voss escape in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of many women as serious “missing software and hardware ” that made the military ship useless if it was sent to a military mission.
Software faults were particularly important because a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class military ship will be operated by 120 crew members, which is half the size of a Bremen-class military ship.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7000 tonnes 'Rheinland-Pfalz' ship is estimated to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware flaws, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has begun to cause problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), but initially it was to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the most recent ships are particularly important in view of the warning that German superiority is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Senate's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually becoming a 'unworkable ship'.
The representative said that the problem arose over time, for older ships were taken out of service but no ships replaced them.
He regretted that none of the orders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be used by the Navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Organization is spying on the secret life of bats
A new study carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland Nature Conservation Organization will monitor different species of bats in the Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be installed in key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also undertake monitoring missions with handheld sensors.
Experts will sound all recordings to find out the frequency and types of callers that the bats give away.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be published to give an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nightlife Protection Counsellor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat is most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the cost of management, e.g. by creating a meadow and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bats have decreased considerably in the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk from building and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and light can also cause risks, including fly paper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as domestic vehicle attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced mining techniques to locate insects and objects on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land, takes bats very seriously.
At the organizations, ten experts carry out regular examinations, raids, and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even established Scotland’s first and only bat country at the Threeave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten bat species live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the caretaker of the ranch, says he is a perfect territory for them.
"The area here at Threeave is great for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and lots of good living areas.
But there is still much unknown about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more fully what they need to clean up."
He stressed the importance of examining bats before maintaining housing, since possible accidental destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young people and destroy all the bats in the area.
Bats are protected, and they are prohibited from killing, harassing, or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish agent of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know how well many of their species are doing. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare legal proceedings against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of raping “false news ” and says that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus campaigners have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel’s report on Friday, he was reported to have paid her $37,000 afterward for shutting down the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, told his 142 million followers in a Instagram Live video that they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the World Champion five times to the camera.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player to smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of privacy concerns, ” according to Reuter’s newsroom.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would demand compensation for “an injury of the same amount as the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in the suite of the Palm Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed for the district of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told her that he was a “99 percent good man ” who was tempted by the “one percent. ”
The papers argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they both agreed.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and had her injuries taken in the hospital, but finally agreed to be accepted outside the courtroom because she was “afraid of revenge ” and was concerned about becoming“ depressed publicly. ”
She now says she wants to cancel the sweets because she's still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and in some cases he went over to Italian giant Juve with a 100 million Euro contract.
Brexit: Britain would “look forward forever” to losing car manufacturers
Britain would ‘ regret it forever’ if it lost its position as an international leader among car manufacturers by Brexit, says Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a contract, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit without a contract would take on real - life jobs, the effect would be delayed at the borders.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis automobiles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"I believe that if Britain is pushed out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production sites at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern about the exit from the EU without agreement about how inter-national trade should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is that what car manufacturers say is a risk of being caught if Brexit without a contract becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on the 'last hour' reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from supplies both in Britain and the EU for cars produced after ordering.
If Britain reduces its EU without a contract on 29 March, there could be a disturbance at the border which the industry believes could lead to a lack of participation.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's sleeper at its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the May Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "was aimed specifically at preventing these views at the border."
"We need to have a deal, and we want the best deal that will enable us to enjoy not only success in today's world, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of," he said on a radio show on BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyota could not predict how long their production would be stopped, but for a longer time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and who is a trustee of the labor society at the factory, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
Finding between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, Assistant State Attorney, could be “resisted again for one week” now the difference for Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President’s justice.
For weeks stories have been going on in Washington as to whether Trump is going to fire Deputy Attorney General, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times said that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overturning the president by using the 25th additional paragraph of the constitution.
Rosenstein refused these claims.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, including news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he wanted to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not be at the same time as the Senate judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual harassment, witnessed both.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week - long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote payment of the Senate.
Trump’s media representative, Sarah Sander, was on the show on Fox News Sunday.
When asked out in the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been set a date for him, it could happen this week, and I think it may be postponed for another week because of everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I'm always happy to inform the media."
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The director Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not a cause of dissatisfaction that TV reporters had “a vision, ” but she said,“ I don’t disagree with the fact that they have a vision. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
"The President answers more questions to the press than any other President has ever done before," she said, without referring to the sources: "We have gone over these figures."
Media meetings will continue, says Sanders, but “if the media have an opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of things over the past few weeks, and it's going to replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown why in New York this week, when he showed himself to be an unbridled and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU health care professionals in Scotland about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to staff from the EU who work in the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express their gratitude to the people and wish that they continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent letters within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet the costs of EU staff application for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, discussions between Britain and the EU have continued and are expected to be decided in the fall.
The British government has also worked to prepare if not possible under contract.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality.
EU and wider partners provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having had a head injury in a 31-27 loss play against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report from Mike Organ, Tennessee's journalist.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told the reporters that the injury had happened shortly before half a game.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there," said Reed.
Coaches and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and carried out for closer inspection.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris, WSMV radio operator in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had had surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no further information on the type or severity of the injury ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in high school, is playing her first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total bets on Saturday before he left, which raised his total number of bets to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp charges when buying properties in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp charges when buying real estate in Britain. The excess will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plan of the Maintenance Party.
The action will nullify Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamping fees will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in Britain
A government fund plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp charge when buying property in Britain. The excess will be used to help the homeless. Theresa May will announce this today.
The operation will be seen as an attempt to nullify Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by praising housing at an affordable price and taxing high - taxed people more.
Individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK have to pay higher stamp charges, and the excess will take action by the government to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current stamp charges, including the increase applied two years ago at an extra home and real estate for rent - could be up to three percent.
A government fund estimates that the increase will produce up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased from foreign partners, which causes increases in prices and makes it harder for those who want to buy property for the first time to enter the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country — especially in the capital — have become “dream towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamping fees to help other young people to have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel the subscription of households at a reasonable price to fix Britain's "household" rate.
Mr. Corbyn has reported on a number of notable renovations in housing, including the lease and the end of the rental outing without charge.
He also wants to give more counsel on building a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period — that each new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes repairing our ruined real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for foreign parties as companies with foreign headquarters to buy a home and for hard-working British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own dwelling is far removed, and the shame of the homeless is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to train Scotland"
Jack Ross, coach Sunderland, says that ever becoming a trainer in Scotland is his “best goal. ”
This 42-year-old Scotsman now enjoys the challenge of inflating new life in the North-East Club, which is now in third place in the first division, three steps from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning to St. Mirren in the Scottish Grand Prix in the last season.
“I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was injured on my knees and so it was finished," said Ross during an interview with the Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father, as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I did well to train a team."
Ross, a trainer for Sunderland, includes Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic's club said he didn't feel any fear of following in footsteps such as the famous names of such a big club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As I do, I will measure my success by saying, ‘Can I get this club back to the top section? ’
This club is definitely at home in the prime department because of its structure and situation," he said.
“ It’s not an easy job to get him there, but I would probably only think of myself as a success here if I got the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after a period of training as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a training team for Hearts.
He helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and changed St. Mirren, who was falling into the league, into the next season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he was ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real time, ” he says about the period when he became Alloa’s trainer.
“ I really believed that the coaching work was even more appropriate than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I had decent income from it, and enjoyed a decent success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through it with stress and pressure from my job, but the coaching work just seems to me to be right.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I've never felt better about myself in all my adulthood."

The best time for beer is 5:30 on Saturdays, according to polls
The heat wave in summer has been beneficial for British bats, but pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
Sales in puppies and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business consulting firm, who summarized the figures, said: “The continuing sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of June, when beatings increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
Sales fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, mainly for the sale of alcoholic beverages, were the most successful with a greater upswing while restaurants went down.
Fathers who sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
Drinks should be sold in bottles and brooms increased by 6.6 per cent before the month, but food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, reporting on RSM, said: “These results are continuing on the swing we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the effects of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors in the sales of markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in difficulty, even though the sales cut of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on the basis of continued cost - related pressure.
This long and hot summer could hardly come at a worse time before lunch and only time will tell if the tempered temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including in newly opened locations, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowness of openings.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the monitoring company with a sale in the British pub and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups, with a combined roll-up of 9 billion pounds and is the industry target for the sector.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the findings of a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in Insta's 'genuine' pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students say they have an 'primary' account that they show parents
One in five children, down to 11 years of age, make secret accounts of social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a large increase in Insta’s “genuine ” accounts, which is a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "primary" account to show parents, as well as keeping secret accounts.
One mother, who fell on the secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager who urged others to “rape me. ”
The study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and HMC, showed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 years of age had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many youths were tempted to create an area on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as head of the executive board at the annual General Assembly of the Government.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free sportswoman, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field in the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money on getting it to the committee,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope that I can do my part and help to continue the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 200 - meter and 400 - meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but now has a total of four Olympic gold, and a regular BBC guest, was paralyzed after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I was normal and how much.
It has been hard work, but I got to the point where I learned to walk again and do sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast pump ad, which compares mothers to cows, causes network differences
Enterprises producing a breast pump are now mentioned on the Internet because of advertisements that carry lactating mothers to lactating cows.
The company Elvie published a warm advertisement to highlight what is said to be “the world’s first portable breast pump, ” inspired by music videos and to show the freedom of the new pump to mothers who are breast - fed.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay, and we dance with songs such as, “Yes, I’m milking, but you don’t see any tail on me” and, “If you didn’t notice, it’s not the eddies but the breasts on me. ”
The supplement continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the Julys. ”
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, has led to publicity on the Internet.
The video features 77,000 viewers and hundreds of referees and has had a different response from the audience, many of whom say that it was successful with “the horror ” of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we do, they must become calves and bear to produce milk, except what the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said one speaker.
Elvie breast pump fits comfortably in the Elvie/Mother
Another observer wrote: “Absolutely difficult for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is completely out of date. ”
Others came to the defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that it was “rapidly funny. ”
“I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took her as she is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the spectators.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or in a toilet) and feels like “coum. ”
This is not a advertisement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the female group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when they pump milk.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably into the chest holder, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and head of Mother’s family, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved a prominent presentation that would give a publicity.
By likening women to cows, we wanted to direct the spotlight to breast - pumping and all of her challenges, even showing in a fun and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie pumped into the news.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children presented a fashion show to designer Martha Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant bears quietly moved to a camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant bears in detention has increased suddenly, even though the number of those crossing the border has remained virtually the same each month, part of which is that harsh speech and direction that the government of Trump has set out have made it harder for the children to enter the temporary fetus.
In general, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and they have feared that they might continue to be at risk in the country by volunteering to nurse a child.
The risk increased in June, when the government announced that potential foster parents and other domestic adults would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of immigration and customs supervision, witnessed to the Senate and said that his agency had arrested a number of people who wanted to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on a criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in the home of foster children are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants on a criminal record.
"That is why we keep looking for their individuals," said Mr. Albance.
In an effort to speed up the work of the children, representatives reported on new rules requiring some of the children to appear in a courtroom within a month of their being put in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the first criteria, according to employees who work in the workplace.
Many of them will come through a video conference, rather than in their own person, to justify their legal standing before judges in immigration matters.
The children who are convicted of incapacity for entry into the country are quickly sent out of the country.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent or fugitive attempts, according to the workers of the shelters and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely to occur in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having difficulty because of their number.
They added that the move of their children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say good - bye to friends could add to the shock that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria is saying that the United States, France and Turkey are withdrawing immediately.
Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the General Assembly of the United States that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign troops were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly. ”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the council.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories“ of both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of them training and advising both the Kurdish and Syrian forces who are fighting against the President of Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to spread“ causeless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They make politics out of something that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the resistance to end the war.
Erindreker U.S.A. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up neutral territory at the last large wall of the resistance has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack by the Syrian troops supported by the Russians, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a 'clear deadline' and expressed the hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador of the United States, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft a postwar constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that her work should be limited to “going over the current government’s regulations, ” warning all parties.
Reasons for Trump to win a second term
According to that statement of reasoning, Mr. Trump would win the election in 2020, unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberals probably hope.
In what would no doubt be “the most dramatic end ever for President Peter! ”
At present, the audience has no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, observations at the best time have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the feature of MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has peaked at up to 3.5 million viewers in important news reports.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama about a government employee who will be president after the Congressional House is completely destroyed.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comic writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, ” has another suggestion.
She remembers going to a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Ms. Scovell to me.
There's entertainment in the mess.
Unlike TV, however, the Washington stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether families of immigrants can unite and health the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an enlightened citizen when you look at the sixth hour at a group of experts arguing Bob Woodward’s use of “very close” sources for his book“Fear,” or a $15,000 ostrich jacket that Paul Manafort wore (“a garment born with pride,” said the Washington Post), and the consequences of Stormy Daniel’s accurate biographical descriptions on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The end of what he does to an unblemished person feels it's like a reality factor, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the "Pawn Stars" program, when he discussed the personnel field in Trump's exhibition and the daily changes in the history threads (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.L. and complimenting Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you'll lose the thread.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees Fahrenheit and the sun was outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he was recording CNN.
He could not break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were making all these crazy things in the old days, and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right. ”

Money outflows in the shortest elections in the mid-period
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing to it, thanks to the reorganization of areas that led two representatives to compete for the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area is sending out the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another constituency in special elections last summer.
Lamb invites himself to meet another representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a great deal to do with the new 17th district.
The maps of the territories were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old territories were organized in the interests of the Republics and that they violate the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district has begun with the launch of a competition in the financing of campaign campaigns between the main donors of both classes, the Democratic Committee (DCC) and the Committee of Representatives (NRCC).
Lamb became familiar with the Pennsylvania name after a short victory in a special March election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania, but many followed them.
The Republicans had previously spoiled it for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, president of the region, won a 20 - degree victory.
Political experts have given a little head start to democrats.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but then stopped.
Kingdom workers noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners drove away the management team of the Trump corporation.
Representatives of the State Department decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “a recent decision not to accept the Tevan any longer,” said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson of the U.S. Bureau in early this month.
However, punishments against El Salvador alone were considered, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug monitoring, development work, and economic support.
The penalties imposed, which included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where unemployment is high and murder rates are high.
As preliminary meetings continued, the United States and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity and were to follow a similar meeting held last year, which was considered to be a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
By mid - September, however, representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, resulting in all the misgivings about punishment against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, Vice President, is now going to address the conference, to be held in the middle of October, as a symbol of the importance of the government, said the ambassadors.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss in detail the discussions that the three U.S. representatives described, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the internal debate against being nameless.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and spoke on the matter against anonymity.
Learn the History
The next scandal may be the report by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, of Mr Trump's possible actions to prevent justice, but for this accusation there are numerous official evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turns his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If the council is to be controlled by another group, Trump may have to be held accountable for it, at the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps his associates may have to be ordered to do so.
However, this is very uncertain and I do not want to suggest that Trump's downfall is unquestionable, nor is his fellow Europeans' downfall.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to rob Hitler of power, only if Western countries had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the calamities that followed.
History revolves around such important points, speeding up or delaying the unstoppable course of democracy.
The United States is facing a few such important points now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man responsible for the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed his incapacity for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of a Supreme Court judge despite credible accusations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect Congress in the mid-term that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and formerly sat in my ambassador’s camp.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the chinkross.
With such an inheritance, how can I look other than positive to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' assistant, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the G-group of the European Union. Rangers made an impressive level playing field in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
A knee injury prevented the centre guard Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the season until the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 tie, but he believes that Rangers can take advantage of it as a jumpboard for better results.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and end up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have advanced to victory at the end, but in general, a balanced outcome was likely.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important night for the European Union.
I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in their last game, but with the crowds that support us, I'm sure we'll endure this and get a positive outcome.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injury and because of the changes that took place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team's good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training's good.
I hope we can get further along now, put the last season behind us and make a success."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of losing pension savings
Even though participants in the poll had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few of them discussed this with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long - term care with their mates.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children.
“People want family members to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Department.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not give them your wishes with good warnings.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and when you are being cared for, as these options can change greatly in terms of costs.
Include your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own money--as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid legal differences in advance.
Get a health care professional so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care system and ensure that your healthcare professionals will do so if you cannot tell them directly.
Consider, too, how to obtain a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you can’t make them yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on her way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please give them exactly in your written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not just about finance, it’s about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“Who are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be ready with that plan."
A man shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot many times with an air gun when he was on his way home walking after having a good time outside.
The victim is a man in his 50 ’ s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as “an attack by random means. ”
The victim did not see his assailant.
The man did not get hurt life threateningly, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Flood Waves in Indonesia
At least 384 people left their lives after a powerful earthquake and a flood in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and it is expected that the dead will rise.
Since all communications are down, relief workers have not been able to provide any information from the Donggala County, which is north of Palu and lies near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 at Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Palu after the disaster raged over.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow river on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40 - year - old birthday when the earthquake and the tidal wave struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 300 miles [380 km] of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district government had an estimated population of 2,99,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of which are located in Morowali, near Sulawesi.
Flood waves have flooded Pala and Donggala several times in the past century, according to the Indonesian disaster agency.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a flood wave struck and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
Also, in 1996, a tidal wave would engulf the western part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and flood waves in recent years:
2004: Large earthquakes on the west coast of the Aceh region in northern Sumatra raged over December 26 and started a flood wave that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than half were in Aceh.
2005: A row of strong tremors crossed the west coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, from the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter River over southern Java, Indonesia’s largest island, caused a tidal wave that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the Richter River, located near Padang, a capital city in the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake at 7.5 on the Richter River over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up up to 100 - foot - high [10 m] flood waves that destroyed a number of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Founded by an earthquake, the Pidie Jaya County in Aceh caused destruction and terror when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and floods in 2004.
No wave was formed this time, but over 100 died when buildings collapsed.
2018: Big tremors hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former president of Alaska and president of the United States, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, trying to prevent domestic violence and resist arrest, according to a report from the Alaska State Police Department, published on Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he is waiting to be heard for judgment, and he is held against $500 insurance, as reported by KTUU.
He could be judged on Saturday, when he declared that he was “not guilty, certainly ” when he was asked to declare guilty or innocent, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three A - class crimes, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and has to pay $250,000 in fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B crime, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The issue is now under consideration for the Alaskan surrender court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing domestic violence, and of carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of surrender fighters who, after his military service in Iraq, taught a distressing disorder about his son’s violent behavior.
Earthquake and a tidal wave in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - year - old earthquake set off a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and are expected to increase the number of dead people in the next few days.
The earthquake hit the middle of Sulawesi Island, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Video footage of the incident is now going through the community media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tidal wave fell on the beach.
Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors want a death penalty against Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have taken a Home Depot truck to attack people on a wheelchair along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he drove down walking and cycling on the road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims “wildly ” and caused serious physical injuries “wildly, ” according to the will statement to use a death penalty recorded in the New York District Court.
Both of these defendants may lead to a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 acts, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized criminal organizations, and Saipov was accused of violent crime and of destroying the car.
The attack included "talently planned planmaking", the accusers said and described Sapiov's actions as "horrible, cruel, and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the willful declaration.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since New York’s last death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of having murdered two drug dealers, who were eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in the New York court case in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being convicted for spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance during the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told an investigator that he was doing well, said a police officer.
Saipov told the authorities that he had got the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, as stated in the charge.
He also asked to show the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said that they were “of course disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of agreeing to a life imprisonment declaration without the possibility of parole will only prolong the shock of this event for all participants," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
The congressman says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to ‘invigorate the army of the people’s forces ’ today to protest at a conference held by the conservatives.
This former leader, Ukip, said that at the same time as a congressman, Theresa May suggested that politicians should be under pressure from EU skeptics to lead the negotiations with the EU.
At the protest march in Birmingham, the author Peter Bone said that if Mr Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain would be “going out. ”
However, the challenge that May faces in resolving deep differences between her own teammates became even more evident when EU citizens who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty keeping the Chequers programme on track and is critical of those who are in favour of Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The Allies claimed that it will continue to fight to reach agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those opposed to Brexit and the Workers ’ Party to choose between her plan and her “distress. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leaven protest walk in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been involved and assume responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight World Wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone referred to evidence that the public opinion changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public changed its mind and wants to stay is totally untrue. ”
Andrea Jenky, a conservative supporter of Brexit, also attended the protest march and told the reporters: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the public, and the opposition will not choose with it, and it is unpopular among our classmen and activists who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, stop the Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Pristine Ministers will keep their work when they keep their promises. ”
Mr. Farage said that if the politicians were to avoid the decision taken after the 2016 vote, they would have to “be under pressure. ”
“This is now about trust between our people and our political party, ” he said.
"They want to try to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get away with this."
He added in his messages to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political party, which is drifting away from Brexit.
We are inciting the army of the general population in this country that won us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters were protesting in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour protest meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Workers ’ Party, made fun of the safety concerns raised by the group’s telephone program when the conference was opened.
"This is the people who tell us that they can keep all the computer systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus, for border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders," he added.
“This is a complete scandal.
There's no such thing as good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to "consider seriously" to present himself to the President's office.
Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator, says that after the November election, “there is a serious proposal for the President’s Office. ”
According to a Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts democrat discussed his future at a city meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has rarely criticized President Donald Trump of the United States, volunteered for election in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focal point of misgivings that she could present herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her district, since Trump took office.
One attending the meeting asked her if she had the intention of volunteering to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and order our government, and then also need a woman as a leader. ”
Arrest following a fatal shooting at Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that she had arrested one of the suspects in the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot to death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police reported an arrest on Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who was seen on the tape.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near Southern University University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died because of it," said Murphy J. Paul, police chief, at the Saturday press, as reported by 247sports.
Wayde came to his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been at the scene, with weapons in his way, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any trouble and detained in Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was two meters tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played 32 games, of which 10 were in the first season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and achieved 2.9 performances each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat, ordered by them.
It was evident from the fact that Valtteri Bottas took a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before the launch of Saturday, that orders from Mercedes would play a major part in the competition.
Bottas got a good start at the launch and almost left Hamilton while defending his position in the first two bends and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to decide.
The Mercedes car went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came across after a few battles in which the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having been in danger of being left, after defense attempts in the third turn.
Max Verstepp started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first ring, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen and finish fourth.
He finally went into the pit at round 44, but could not speed up the remaining eight rings, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
This is a difficult day, for Valtteri stood up splendidly all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has done great to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad body expression.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claim that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Judge, of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not address the Ford witness directly to the Senate Committee, saying that what was going on at the Senate Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and unprovable.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and cruel and unprovable, ” he said.
“ When you see the lights and leaks and then they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick this?
Remember her answer... You closed the document - “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't paint it."
Wait a minute.
"No, we won't lie," he said, and he imitated the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, and it was leaked early in September, so Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't tell her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it in secret, and I did as she asked me to. ”
But her denial did not seem to go well into the president, who said at Saturday’s meeting: “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't read anything, but it was the worst body expression I've ever seen."
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, suggesting that democrats were taking advantage of the accusations.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are needed.
You see the cruelty, the evil, the no matter who they hurt, whom they must choose to gain power and control," said the President, according to a report from the Mediaite.
Elite League Division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two limits for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for her loss on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point advantage from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownnie settled for the locals, but Dwyer came over the Giants again.
Francois Bouchard usually for Dundee, and two boundaries from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won their victory.
This was the third loss in the season for the Adam Keefe team in the Elite League, who had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and the Giants had won the three games before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m., following a signal from Kendall McFaul, David Rutherford then delivered a signal when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.

Air traffic controllers make life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed when a great earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and followed by a wave of floods.
Great aftershocks continue to plague the territory, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his associates had fled the control tower that swung violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft number 6321, which was on the airstrip when the earthquake raged, could certainly be taken up.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling.
Later, he died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from the Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead could exceed a thousand, when the national disaster agency says that access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"The number of dead is still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Agency.
Up to five feet [6 m] tall waves have caused a massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft are working to provide relief equipment and supplies.
In an interview with Sky News, 35 - year - old Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the work associated with the deportation.
Are you ready?" said a story from CNN.
Earlier this year an earthquake hit Lombok, Indonesia, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini is now saying that the same thing is missing after a plane crashed into a lounge
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed into a payroll in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, having said before that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that from the afternoon on Saturday, it did not know about the performance of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with the local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed in the lounge just ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway too far.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the approach had been very low.
"It was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could wade down the water and find emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the Air Forces were afraid and shouting and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who were working late in the construction of a dock also helped with the rescue by using an uplifted boat to take people ashore before the plane sank to about 30 feet [30 m] of deep water.
Air Safety Agency data show that 111 people have been killed in aircraft accidents in PNG-registered aircraft in the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors ended their case in a resuming case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, spent hours in the courtroom as an expert in information analysis.
He explained to his abdomen how he used cell phone records to compress the travels of the defendant, 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, on the contrary to his previous claims, as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, a police officer went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers ’ death, Tellis had removed text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He destroyed her out of his life," said Hale.
It is estimated that defenders will deliver their final address on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be filed later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to fight a negative view of the music by filling their music with positive messages.

They want to look for the source again and make conscious hip hop again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent upswings in Britain through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nursing in New York Lawyers for Disfellowshipping Following “Prejudice ” Text Message
Nanny in New York legalized a couple for illegal expulsion after she received an unexpected text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person. ”
So the couple refuse to be prejudiced, and they liken the prosecution to “fiction. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that her new nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, Ms. Maurice ran "quickly" Plasco-Flaxman and said that their former black nurse had been ill-advised, and that she had expected a Filipino woman, according to a New York Post report.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber's car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the dismissal, for the amount of $350 a day for the six - month job she had originally been hired, even though no contract had been signed.
"I wanted to show them that you shouldn't do this," she said in an interview to Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is a difference."
The couple have protested the accusation that they were prejudiced, saying that driving Maurice was the right thing to do, for they felt that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she would not say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," said Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust their children to someone after showing this rudeness, even though it was surprising?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco likened the prosecution to “fiction, ” saying that his wife was seven months away and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this state?
It's not very nice," said Plasco, who works at the investor.
The matter is still in court, but the public has spoken harshly about the couple in the social media and has ashamed of their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
"It's very funny now that we know of the tremendous success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his works with calm positiveness, adding that the 60th anniversary of his publication was “very sweet ” after his death last year.
As for Paddington, which she describes as “an extremely important member of the family, ” she added that her father had shown a silent pride in his eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man, not used to boast," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something, you’re proud of it even if you haven’t really done anything yourself.
I think he's almost looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given to her to keep her heart beating up were gradually losing its function and being eliminated from her body.
She had died a short time earlier, and that was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I could not sing or scream or cry, for I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she had experienced.
"No one knew anything," she said.
“ I fell headlong, and tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Wounded women hang up messages to prevent self - murder on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
At the age of 18, Tyler, the son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide.
“I don’t want a parent to feel the way I have to feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room."
He stopped working before he died, for he was “soaked down to a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about the consequences. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit there and don't say anything. You have to talk to someone."
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost his mate Mark to 15 shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t talk about feeling bad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye, nor anything."
She said that his death was a great shock to them, but that they had to work on it: “This will tear a hole in the family.
This will tear us apart.
But we must persevere and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on a blue wire when the FBI has its investigation
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a limited amount of time and scope — we might get a little peace, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the committee would be “disintegrating” in the middle of a conflict between the groups where everything was in the back.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The mid - term exams will be in just five weeks, on November 6, when, as is expected, Republicans go badly, their serious attempts to get their husbands elected to sit in the Supreme Court will weaken.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, through him, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its research report?
A vote will be held at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet certain that Mr. Kavanaugh could receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but this would enable President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it in the office of a Supreme Court judge.
The number of those fleeing North Korea "reduced" under Kim
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-sichug, quoted data from the South Korean Coalition Council and said that 1127 people had fled last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a stricter border alert between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official declaration.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship rights.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross it than the well-known neutral territory between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often forcing them to return to their homeland.
Technically speaking, relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for discussions mainly on delayed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong-un of Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a rough fashion towards a nuclear-free Korean.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Secretary of State of North Korea, blamed American trade unions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about our country’s security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take our nuclear weapons down one side first,” said Ri in his speech at the U.S. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "motherly ill" and says he is unfit to perform the duties of a Supreme Court judge
Nancy Pelosi, director of the minority at Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Justice “motherly ill ” and said he was too audacious to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped those words during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease, ” Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the accusation that he had harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and at times he cried out and got cakes in his neck as he discussed his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned democrats on the committee, calling the charges upon him “an illegitimate and organized genocide, ” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi claimed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to the Democrats.
"I think that these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he is unfit for the job," she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired from work if he was confirmed and if the Democrats reached the majority in Congress.
“I will say this: if he is not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the appeal court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law of Roe v. Wade, where he is believed to be a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “a great deal is wonderful.” ” said Pelosi.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is just talk, months, and years of rage, and it does not come out without weeping.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon, do you?"
She continued: “I received much help from a woman who was an executive at some point and said that she also cried when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of my previous job, which I had in my office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of the rage that I could not express, came an older woman and took into my head-pump. She was a cold boss whom I had always feared a little and she dragged me into the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think that thou art sad, and rejoice that thou hast entered into the midst of thee.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was serving as president, then she was a Congressman of Democrats from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a shipwreck called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his offer, Ms. Schroeder, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the president.
"It wasn't a well - thought out decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other providers, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it "White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign was over, she was following in the field of fundraising, so she vowed not to volunteer unless she managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
“ Do they think I’ll get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed by the feelings -- the gratitude of the people who had supported her, the resentment of the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct their eyes to voters instead of representatives, and the anger of the sexual malignment -- that she burst into tears.
"It could have been thought that I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media responded.
“ Kleenex could be thought to be my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
The reason why a business war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the U.S. - China - U.S. trade war were raging, and even though the war is far from over, the country could be a long - standing asset to Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China’s major exports, including solar power supplies, steel, and aluminium.
This week’s greatest rate of growth came with new customs duties that cover goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time, and recently 5 to 10 percent of U.S. goods have been taxed at $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States’s customs policy, and it is unlikely that another world’s largest economic system will give way soon.
To get Washington to jump, demands must be met, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China to officially bow down from the United States.
Experts say, though, that if Beijing is right about the cards, the pressure from the U.S. business war could have a positive effect on China in the longer term, reducing the mutual need for both.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the conditions that lead to economic downturn in one country or another is really far more dangerous than the viewers have previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, an investigator who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria "ready to go" for refugees to return, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country willingly and to seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the UN General Assembly and said that conditions in the country were improving.
“ Today, the conditions on earth are more stable and secure, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to establish normal conditions by building areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
All are now ready for refugees to return willingly to the land they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the one - side economic decisions that focused on their daily lives and jobs.
The U.S. estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would be happy to help rebuild the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept assistance depending on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Union has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 points on the Le Golf National Field, except for Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on a European basis and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when, under the leadership of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn, it reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble most of the race, struck his initial hit in the water of a 16th hole, a pair of three, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the results 5-0-0, since the race started using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost five and four against Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, who was the lowest in the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who played possibly in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spanishman Sergio Garcia, who has played around the Ryder Cup eight times, became the most victorious European champion of the race with a 25.5 grade.
“ I do not weep at all, but today I cannot help myself.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help," said Emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He handed his country John Rahm the torch, but he won the American golf legend Tiger Woods two and a half in a solo game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud to have conquered Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the competition for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only second in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding themselves on the field all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Feau, who played a good game throughout the race.
“ I’m proud of them, ” lamented the United States president Jim Furyk, who was disappointed by the performance of his team.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take over for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and I'll call the Ryder Cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than us."
