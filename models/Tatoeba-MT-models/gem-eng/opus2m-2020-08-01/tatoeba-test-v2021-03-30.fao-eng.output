Father woe, you some are in the heavens! Blessed be the name of a man; if the kingdom come, let some be in heaven like this on earth; let us give thanks to the day of our daily change; and let us give thanks to our debts, so as to give some meaning to our debtors; and let us not suffer temptations; but let us save yokes from ten evil. For if many times a man commits errors of his own, then the heavenly Father will strengthen his strength; but for the sake of not many monsters, the Father doesn't approve but gives birth to errors of his own.
