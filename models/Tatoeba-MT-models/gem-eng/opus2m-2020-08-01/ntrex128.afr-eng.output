Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they're going to look like fools.
There's some constancy among some meeting members on the proposal that their title should be changed from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum are afraid that it might provoke a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the change of name, but has noticed that it is a short leap of speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that were widely supported to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a public consultation.
AM'e seems to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle for consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the working methods of the meeting, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last say in the question of what to call them when they debate legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country’s name
voters will vote on Sunday or change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long demanded that the name of its neighbour in the north represent a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's become silent because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historians spoke, said the old people to whom I spoke, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize these days in other ways," he said.
"Crowds are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people regularly go."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and will therefore bring the day that these churches completely shut down even closer, for most of the people who move into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first carlion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carlion at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What has been playing at Saint Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, which consists of laymen - wrote in July to the diocese with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on the cost" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of transparency from the diocese's side.
Shark injures 13-year-old on a lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old son on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster on the first day of the lobster season in California, says officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy yell for help and then rowed closer with a group to help him pull out of the water.
He said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobster catch, but then he realized "that he called, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn open," Hammel saw as he came out to the boy.
'I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plan to Expand to UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's says Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams fight with department store-type beauty walks staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if it is successful next year will be taken to more shops.
The investment in beauty occurs as supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it's going to double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include for the first time trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique grimmering series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more younger buyers are demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which has opened in Croydon in southern London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the outlets Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also released a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years back, which, according to their grocery sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000's, but the relationship was terminated after an argument on how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within his shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to satisfy every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an important beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'enraged' after TV operator Holly Willoughby withdrew her from a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home clothes and accessories trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby made Dragons enraged Peter Jones by withdrawing at the last moment from their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "enraged" when TV's golden girl announced on Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business district in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories trade name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled according to insiders Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority by far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid to all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the introduction.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that stands ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning Provider, one of Britain’s stars that brings in the most money, can chase the firm millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its introduction may encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples have a vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We'll make no comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He laughed at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma "newsreader voice".
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament were raging.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "corresponding reaction" from the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic turn in his convention talk.
"We're making excellent progress with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relations with Kim produced positive results — ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing just there," said Trump as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Tidal wave and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, dead hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they were not asking for international help, which made it a little difficult," said me.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the constant earthquake that Indonesia endures, the country sadly remains poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis owls were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other shorelines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu had probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning was in force.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's captivated infrastructure a core of his election campaign and spent hard money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is plagued by shortages of funding, as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko is also faced with the pressure of sluggish sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs fought with machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good leveller against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he kicked far to the finish pole.
The effort sailed high above the frame as it hovered to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball over a jumping Kepa arrizabalag froze and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and type once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked."
Chelsea was 1-0 by mid-term after the Belgian star Eden Hazard recorded a target in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper replayed to Mateo Kovacic in that playroom with a rear head before he pulled off near the middle field and inducted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward head he then led for Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest target net.
Liverpool conducts the battle against Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea arrives on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League before Videoton.
Death to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, said the country’s disaster agency on Sunday early.
It was reported that many people were trapped among the garbage of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, to collapse, and caused torches of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after women have been stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife stabs, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the perimeter of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that could be indispensable to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s loved ones.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one in or out of the building was allowed.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Inhabitants are now said to take hours before they are reintroduced.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She said repeatedly, 'It's so awful.'
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crime Stoppers anonymous at 0800 555 111 to log 247 of September 30.
Parliament's statute of Cromwell becomes the newest memorialist with 'rewrite of history'-dispute
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "sickness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the form of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of commemoration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as patron is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Murder Pork Mistakes Chinese Boer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his, "Yuan," was found dead with a torn-off artery covered with blood, near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on May 30, 2005 to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighouse open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cage with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloodshed and torn," said the cousin, who was called "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of attacking pigs have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're not playful.
They're dicks, very curious... they're not interested in hurting you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Traveling from Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring torrential rains across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
On Sunday from 5 a.m. to the east, Rosa had winds of 85 m.p.h., a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific begins to form and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa on Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northward to the southwestern US.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then, in response to the approaching trough over the coming days, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, waste streams, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be most unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep gorges to become raging rivers and thunderstorms to bring violent local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause minor waste and smooth rhizomes.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains late Monday and Tuesday become more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heats will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will start to warm in October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Low Plain to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-spot turn: an agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was getting drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose polling hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, said Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day trial.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where protestors shouted at him when he tried to take an elevator to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while CNN was vividly picturing how he was being reviled.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and had gone before the elevator door, said that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all living hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would do it only with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as requested by the Demokraat minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Demokraat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accused critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political gambling" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending the Konservativ party conference in Birmingham, Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should collect each other's rates was "quite ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, said Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the wrestling.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS-philified WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he had confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The courthouse of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and territorial civilians for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked regional law for his "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Its average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "plattered" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
As spitting out of the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and registering 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple swings and tremors.
Images on social media showed how thin low - gas automobile windshields covered neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central-Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonian separatists before commemoration of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters collided with riot police, and thousands joined protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for renunciation.
A group of masked pro-separatists who had been held back by riot police, they bombarded with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually teem with tourists.
A mob also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their clubs to keep the fighting in check.
In several hours pro-independence groups sang in one tone "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' screams of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries contracted in the processions, reported the local press.
The tension still runs high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against renunciation who largely gave up the voice.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted violent clashes in order to prevent voting from continuing at the polls across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital but close-up victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in detention for interrogation, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Husbands arrested after driving against home

Detective Bob Blommings said that the gates were damaged and the building itself was damaged.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage to the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston Ensures Victory
Promoted Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose proved the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a win and next week comes to stand before the forerunners Heart, who are ahead of them eight points.
Rangers are first host to Rapid Vienna in the Europaliga on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is expanding their unconquered run in the division to six games, with principal coach Holt who has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Chances Against Bot Visitors
Holt's team must have progressed long before they had recorded a goal, with their bristling that Rangers had brought all sorts of problems upon their necks.
SR broke through, but carried in front of the goaltop, then AL could only play wide after he got closer and met CH’s headpiece across the goaltop.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors at times of death.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers lost a freehead and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the center of the frame.
By then, Rangers had dominated possession but were unable to penetrate the home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely carefree.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow had typed wide to avoid another open game of Livingston.
Crosses repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties were dismissed — after Halkett’s challenge of replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
‘Phenonomial’ of Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their game style and crew have been almost unchanged since their return to first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his magnificent defense arrangement while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they were unable to maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (September 29,) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outrage over issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from coming together before the mosque, but many supporters came along to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of their Kurds – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted as hero by some German Turks and found out by others as autocrat.
Deptford Road Accident: Biker dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-step in Children's Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers are working on identifying the man and informing his close relatives.
Roadblocks and bus bypasses were replaced, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
Riot broke out about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still on the move at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called in to deal with the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The custodians were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six personnel were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had received hospital treatment after he had been attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which billiard - ball personnel were attacked.
Hurricane Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluge (Drøgegebiete Trek Dalk Voordel)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but that's exactly what can happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings flash flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid - flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday it will be late approaching with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a twite that only "ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Kom, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with an isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the current flood risk, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial since the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drying Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land across the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific, so her power decreases.
Thus, it is expected that Monday will reach the country in the afternoon or evening against tropical storm power in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Rainval totals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported weather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border on Tuesday in the early hours of the morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life - sustaining flash floods and waste streams in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempting Murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone footage of what had happened to come to the fore.
Trump says Kavanaugh said that 'had suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered from the malaise, the rage" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed on Thursday before Congress, denying an ardent and emotional claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also bore witness to her claim during the trial.
The president said on Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Justice Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most capable jurists of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the middle-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for these candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrat was on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach on Friday in the city of Palu for a feast on the beach when surfers from up to six meters (18 feet) broke high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-scale earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNP during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive shaking was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have made the size of the tsunami worse, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake herd.
Communication "was totally blocked by no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, said the Red Cross in a statement, and added that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected area.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not announce that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning had been issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, it can be heard a man on the top floor of a building shouts desperate warnings about the coming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters could not explain the image immediately.
The tremor and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuations continued to require food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers sheltered from covert shelters set up in their office courtyard, they passed by scenes of devastation, said Dosheba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that had been destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as aid groups start off with the terrible task of starting the disaster relief work, some people complained that foreign aid workers were very experienced in preventing them from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and staff from overseas can only get started after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, it's a national disaster," we can open it up for international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second evening on Palu to Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
Sunday, rescuers saved a woman for two days under rubble was stuck with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national paratrooper, trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still among those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mondayi, were his students.
"As a senior in the paratrooper's field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the parachute-weaving community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray deed, instead of two blue deeds.
"I think it means the messages aren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling OTM by Newport on the Life
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who had refilled an OTM at Newport on the Life, according to a Newport Police Station news release.
The car driver was emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote, "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for some time been nicknamed Ye and has used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday night live where he is expected to introduce his new allies Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio-supplier Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only one, after only Ye — just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs had been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has also finished with or without a connecting sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the run-up to the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attracted youth to gangs.
US needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made AI announcements, even if the U.S. is short of a complete formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: they aim to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI performance would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Innovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that knocked on the highest-rated American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporates," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work at AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help assist the U.S. AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations hand out money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Test Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months later.
Macedonians must vote in election or change country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", action that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership bids for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name represents a demand in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the attendance would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter read: "You are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission for Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said that by 1 p.m., there were no reports of inconveniences.
But the attendance was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital city of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and drew chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he cast his vote.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute last Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to succeed, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A setback in the referendum will be the first serious setback for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling eliminated the Brighton Defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his 65th - minute goal.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalkeeper received a hint at the middle field.
He was chasing through three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before he passed several others on the edge of the Brighton Goalhouse.
He then pushed a giver to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the cage to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City Manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy that he's recorded a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest goal corner.
The Sky Blues predictor kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back.
City grabel Hoffenheim in Campionenliga Tuesday at 12:55 pm by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which has a one-off lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promoter selection with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still wants to tie up their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throw-exercise on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outcomes in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the middle - term elections.
"All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our times of life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing, and that's why I fight everywhere for these candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "One can see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one can see it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible means, one sees the meanness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, over whom they must walk to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and strength, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrat 'bad and mean and funny and false.'
By name, he referred to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diane Feinstein, who received loud bounties from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Arbeiderparty LP's who were told that we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that differed between Jeremy and previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers ’ Party LP, that was exactly what Friday evening’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinderer, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It became increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Labor Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a tyrade of abusive speech on social media asking me not to be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core, and telling me not to be in the Workers' Party.
And it is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I have a great deal of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who each day face a flood of sexual or racial insults, but never shudder away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
For the past two years I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken and that I will then be "choo".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had literally left my State High School to fail, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who needed it most – whether as a local councilman or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my political positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that is heading towards a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether they are members of the Workers' Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late threes may have drawn the final outcome slightly wrong, but there's no doubt that Ayr had earned to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far in our contests and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr front, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the contest by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to have the numbers counted and Jason Baggot recorded an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest time, intended a solo three to make it 17-5 rest time for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, referred to by Baggot, reduced the arrears to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had taken Climo to death without the ball, and from the penalty stand MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the upcoming Ayr meal.
Climo meant it, after he had also done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe had got David Armstrong's head and sent off the flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star looks like he's about to start a new career in restaurant business.
It seems that Still Game-star is going to move to the hospitality business after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedy teamman Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the program’s last, and it seems that Klauf is preparing for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Astridmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Krune wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant industry".
'The sea is ours': the bordered Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a masqueraded fleet quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is quite right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the bordering Bolivia, the reminder of the coastline they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – nesting the need to revisit the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest it was in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict by the international court on October 1, after 5 years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH verdict on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president – who next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election – also has many that depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that little would change if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign Chilean territory and has speculated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's verdict comes only six months after the final decision shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down in the past four years.
"The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the present Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric tamed any remaining Chilean kindness, she implied.
Bolivia and Chile will be resuming talks at some stage, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in nude discussions.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their U.S. can trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore conference between the leaders of the competing countries.
His comments follow to U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo apparently on the brink of resuming nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead end, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. cap to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal newest series of large main covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn away the sun, you do not have to search any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of large-scale head coverings at their SS19 collection on the walker board that enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Extremely impractical hats went through this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their mind - boggling creations on the walker board.
The highlight of Valentino was a large beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other large accessories included water oranges decorated with jewels, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had finished lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, with a snorkel and diving glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on the way to the shops near you.
The large hat follows briefly the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over socialism sent another great creation over the walker board – a straw-beach bag that was almost as large as the swimsuit-clothed model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia frizz and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags in shops appear for the next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.'
John Edward: Language Skills Vital to World Citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a set of achievements of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which was only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community businesses.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable selection in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 primary schools, showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same status as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons that employees provide why they struggle to fill posts are attributed to 17 percent of a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to invest in today’s children’s language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach that are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country’s future, and therefore they must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages should really be viewed as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
I'll have a beer faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday's debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for supporters to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be playing the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's preseason opening match.
But just how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell struggled that James would probably be playing a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump West Virginia Convention Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a wave of election meetings this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled gatherings in the following week, including stopping in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice currently being held for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is planning to build support for the forthcoming intervention because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's gathering in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's merger in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see below through live streaming to Trump's merger in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice held up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans who face difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign thus said that in the next week these five gatherings were intended to "visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, supports can move from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president must come to give him a boost at the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Driver’s Cup 2018: The U.S. team show courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive as they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryderbeker needed.
The swinging swing of momentum is an all-in-one fictional sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I reckon," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and twelve more being played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the top to the clean field, leading by his example.
Those scoring shouts became louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical sethout to win the match four completely equal as he and Thomas were after two rounds with two backs.
His set-up that won the game for them at 15, was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that you tell a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really should just take everything out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That’s all those players have left.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players to score more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Rider Cup.
Europe’s few but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't record one about track numbers on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one about track numbers on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time or at different wells.
However, it is still too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short mats with Sergio Garcia, the morning four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One likes track numbers and two doubles on the front nine let the Spaniard and the Swede end up in a hole from which they couldn't even almost come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch from close quarters because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can turn into an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team and has taken the lead significantly on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe is 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Rider Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches with a 10-6 lead.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to keep the trophies that they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that was unparalleled in the morning's four-balls, so they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. was more resilient in the four games and won two games but did not shrink back.
Jim Furijk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single - game games to keep the trophies.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend is called "Moliwood," are just the second pair in the history of the Rider Cup who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played well together to defeat a Pap Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5/4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but he now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2 and 1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - who is first and third on the world rankings.
However, Europe did not always get its way on a pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won three big tournaments and Justin Thomas put the mark on Saturday for the Americans with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2 and 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3 and 4 in the four-games after losing the first two wells.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from arrears of four points when they entered the single game, even though Furijk's team just had to play equal to keep the trophies because they're already holding it.
But after they had been second best for two days, they didn't seem to have a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'do not decide' unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s minister of foreign affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are exacerbating their mistrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea has taken "significant welfare measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons by which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed significant in that it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S.A. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to relax strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their aim in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had called attention to earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party were on this issue of nuclear destruction in South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
The tone of Ri's speech was still dramatically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rockets would be directed to the U.S. Landmass after "Mr. Evil President" called Kim a "fire missileman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea "completely," commended Kim for his courage because he took steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must be zealous and continue without letup until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unitedly reinforced sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pjongong's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterward said that he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of "bond-like demands" just hours later.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also take a core complex as the United States "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wanted to see were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all his pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing macho culture of study through coffee-driven 'whole-time sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world's top university are often ignorant when it comes to the basic principles of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he is believed to be the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he had given a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep is--what surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, first offered that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students were found to have been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books should click to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what the health impact of choosing cigarettes is,' added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'to study whole' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he took one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they were going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which could disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Aim of Menga defeats Gerrard’s men
Rangers had another sarcise of daytime heartache when Dolly Menga's goalhead Steven Gerrard's incoherent team brought down 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 matches as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the ground.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a tip of Hearts and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have recorded points after just two minutes when Menga’s first deposit Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle - field player took his big chance.
A deep freeshoe by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the back pole.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he must have got a sentence at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots at the target during the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibary's headshot and a tame head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it is only for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple rounding.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but pushed the impressive Kelly from his stripe to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett pimping long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could enter far from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a criminal head when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sonagoggend" calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR FURTHER ... the day on which the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "All right, it cracks about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ predator cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill robber cells
Vaccine learns immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves the removal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory.
They can then 'see' a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test chemical shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who was teaching the immune system to identify predatory cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "triggers the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his action on SNL, began with a pro-Trump mockery, while he was wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was released in the studio during a Saturday night live after an extended action in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, which was called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he set out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the footage of West’s horror was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West by putting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the platform about what he was wearing on his head.
"They stirred me behind the stage.
They said, 'Do not go out with that hat.'
They've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the low spot?" and said that he would put on his "superman robe, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comment provoked at least twice a announcement from the audience and members of the SNL-roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio has become dead silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhyme chatter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of song I Love it, dressed like a perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who bred: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU TOWARD THE CARD."
But chatting programme hostess Karen Hunter bred that West was simply "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts an ideology and preaches that endangers my community.
He is free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhyme chatter announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the orphan who had been known earlier as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Co-spacer, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had been known as Prince.

It is expected that the defendant will appear Monday before the Belfast County Court.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutorial service.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swathing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy reek Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his associate from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making this issue work.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have our men learned as they grow up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its extremely masculine characteristics.
He continued, "What is innate and what has been taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time--how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-forsaken- and-follow-up pieces when the series next summer came to an end, for he said he was 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here on,' he said.
Rose played Ygrite, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy reek.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, their health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS rose by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70 - 90% of men having sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member has leaked GOP Senators' data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
US Republican Maxine Waters scrambled Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the charges were driven by "ultraright" experts and Web sites.
"Lies, lies, and yet detestable lies," said the Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The extracted information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on the claims of sexual misconduct against the nominee for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses that identified the source of the placements were related to Waters' office and announced the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued the Waters.
"The member of my staff--whose identity, personal information and security was compromised by this deceitful and false claim--was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon triggered online criticism, including from former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she did not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light Waters from the pillows in the middle of the election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he twilighted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the caretakers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strike Again review - flue Rowan Atkinson spy spotting
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British feature and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English action comedy mockery ranchise - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued to struggle with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-little selfish on the subject of how obvious power we are to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the rude Johnny English with his blokes and rubber face had his license to waste everything again for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, contributed a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot from that guy who contributed a single note to the Charios or Fire theme song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, who leaves chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two cute moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor and cut the propeller blades short against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is put on display but the humor feels quite faint and oddly superfluous, especially when the "serious" movie trade marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s adversities are not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent movie jokes in the characters of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty--a lamentable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a puffed-up and besieged character, who's already experiencing a total collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since each active spy is at risk, she must call someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but that from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a school of rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstyex role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus the Batman and Robin are completely wasted in Her Majesty's secret service again on duty and come to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous spell of the charismatic technology billionaire claiming to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury seal hunt; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headpiece to become familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like children's TV.
Fairly mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't stop myself thinking: can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to justice?
Work denies that it is a plan for the British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labor Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but be paid for five days.
The party claims that company base savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving up their extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that in the party's economic agenda and plans to put the country in the favor of the workers, it will 'pass'.
To change to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party that promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
At present, however, the ambition is not endorsed by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesperson of the Workers' Party said, 'A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to dwell on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'faceless directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back since a labor government can make 'deductions' on the grounds of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private - sector businesses to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sensibilities asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could deepen anything they could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it had happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett has zealously denied it," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Civil Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Civil Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness for the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Civil Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international interlocutory group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP card), concertgoers had to do a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime" -- people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twist?
Since 2011, World citizen says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equaling over $37 billion that would potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition become a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "what makes you think that our extreme poverty can end?"
Worldburger replied, "It will be a long and hard road--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartment movements in front of us, we will succeed, because together we have more strength.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman on this year's occasion in New York.
US can use fleet for "blockades" to stop Russian energy exports - minister of internal affairs
"If necessary," Washington may leave on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. minister of domestic affairs revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claimed Russia's involvement in Syria--especially where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government--is a pretext to examine new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an officer, there are ways and means to deal with them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy did not end up on the market," he said.
Zinc addressed the attenders of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit pursuit that considered themselves to be the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said as he referred to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The verdicts come since Trump administration was on a mission to give export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including America's president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin, makes Moscow's "captives".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of printing and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view elicited counterreaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has appealed to the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to be President in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the middle-term elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting and said he'd take the country the wrong way.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very eloquent in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twite Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before our voice."
A recording released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should be in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator was not standing, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Deval Patrick must stand, with 38 percent who supported the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to stand up in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Assembly
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through since he came back, I sympathize with other families who sense the consequences of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there's respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and Air Forces and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was under influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county filed a friend-of-the-court legal order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang members," mistreated her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applications for U.S. seal, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence.
District Columbia's attorney general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court-jurisdiction.
Lawyers have further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refuse access harms the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and provide "necessary labour."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing because of domestic and gang violence.
"Assault is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems — even serious ones — that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly penetrating.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish baby boy at a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants were seen seeking their return to their destroyed homes, through drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-volume quake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital where patients were treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he had shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of bullying with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily praising the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China's paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the U.S. Congressional elections of November 6, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what U.S. officials told Reuters, was a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led them to level tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory early in the trade war was aimed at beating exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in an opinion paper in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now exacerbating bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajek, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has staggered from the offer to publish his article, ” although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's electors from inter-elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top republicans stand at the Supreme Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend himself in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the upcoming inter-elections they would see counter-reactions, especially of women.
The emotions about this are so high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s appeal for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to appease severe voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protesters thundered "November is on their way!" as they argued in the Senate entrance portal while the Republicans who chose the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news station.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among voice-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony set out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genominated, analysts said that if Republicans continue to confirm, they could follow a counter-reaction.
"It has become a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," pointed Guy Cecil, director of Priority USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided over who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with slightly more who choose the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they believe in Kavanaugh or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely jogging during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s incitement, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate's Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genominated exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to say the battle to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, launches an initial business that tries to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-dos lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing a total change anyway, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a position on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Global Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann acquired the award on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglish and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned achievement.
According to London Gazette, lt.kol. won his battalion over the Channel de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "by very heavy fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before he stormed man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feel honoured to play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch the full - package Bellator 206, just not to be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program to be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the UK were beaten to death when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake for the fight until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the child cartoon as "somewhere sick joke."
"It is government regulations that the content was not fit at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice-president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about re-dispatching, I think we can probably work something out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many text messages sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five battles instead of six — as we normally make — and we have tried to offer more to our followers and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he was wailing his feelings about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less care about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are of less feeling than, and otherwise, the real things that have given me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he didn't disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Australian League games to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He says he's aired his feelings because he's so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "caught him on the other side."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar high and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she had changed her whole perspective.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal,' he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had had tickets for London in 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew it was what I had dreamed about for my life – to dive in front of my home classes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first songikeuse — Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in the building up of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson didn't drive and withdrew from Saturday's Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup contest, but he will have to make his shape to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played a record 12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and quadruples.
Instead of being the center of action, as he has often been to the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being cheerleader and working on the top of his game in the hope of correcting the difference.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the right driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long field always punishes the straying blows.
And as if the track on its own wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson came on Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope Champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely necessary.
Fürich expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role which he had today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furijk.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroesaal, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine him playing two games.
I had more in mind, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Rider Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Rider Cup career that has never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halves, although Fürich said that his presence contributed to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to shave the nut, and he's a wonderful guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage for the last day's single game in the Ryderbeker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Deen made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won close-rape with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One continues to remind oneself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we had won close-up," said Bjorn, in the photograph, after watching how the class of 2018 had won Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that is where the focus remains.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing at how his players sailed on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds, "I'll never run ahead of this.
Tomorrow is a horse of another colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, getting the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also find the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furik will want his players to fare better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Frying himself was already on both sides of that great last-day mercenary, where he was part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every diabolical word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had braved his players on his way to that last day.
"We have tomorrow 12 important games, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle games.
We set up our team according to it and divided the men we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face the main battle against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I've chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Again Delayed
The German army’s latest frigate would have been employed in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an array of air-defence and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
But constant delays mean that the advanced warships — evidently enabling Germany to project power overseas — will become obsolete by the time they enter service, called Die Zeit.
Last year, the disastrous F125 frigate made a statement when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss-ship yard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also come to light that the ship is drastically overweight, reducing the performance of the work and reducing the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project – including crew training – has also become a matter of concern.
It has apparently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have gripped the new frigates are especially important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are running out."
The official coat said that the issue worsened over time, for old ships were out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Bats ’ Secret Life
New research is being carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano bat as well as the brown larynx and Daubenton bat at Inverewe Gardene in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert clannalists of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat calls and determine which species is doing.
A Habitat Map and Report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined considerably during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show bugs and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, are very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys and sleep - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the need to seek for bats before conservation in properties is done because it is possible that unknowing destruction of a single maternity centre can mean 400 females and young children's death and can eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, disturbing, or preventing or destroying their sleeping places is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo makes rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus actors were accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time balloon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," added the player smilingly.
Ronaldo's attorney is getting ready to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount that matches the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "afraid of retaliation" and worried about becoming "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Manchester United at Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million deal to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if they lost their world leader status in car production to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop production temporarily at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit could cost posts.
Last year, the Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line runs on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disruption on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "prevalences have been calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success but for us to seize this opportunity," he said to the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be stopped but warned that in the long term, additional costs could reduce the plant’s competitivity and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's convoy at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back again.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein can be "suspended by another week" while the fighting on nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Legal Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible cross-fence of the law by the president.
Whether Trump is going to resign the deputy attorney general or not, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip stories have been on fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced to Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not" to thank Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate court trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and continued postponing the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it is not yet fixed, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a Whitehouse press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are "impact hunt," although she said, "I won't argue with the fact that they are impact hunts."
She implied that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more V&A sessions than any president in front of him," she said, adding without quoting evidence, "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We try a lot and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bizarre appearance before journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they would stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote to me: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible no-agreement scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after main injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a main injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodore, Tennessee-span reported Mike Organ.
Tennessee State principal coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and sort of just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no more details about the type/ scope of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 fatalities.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesoury expects to raise up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp - tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The by - tax — in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to rent — can be as much as three percent.
The Thessoury expects this move to bring in as much as £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who push up the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spake villages” as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a stamp tax reduction to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to relinquish quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain’s housing disaster.
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of planned housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no error releases".
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as foreign - based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of homelessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to drive Scotland.'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at one point.
The Scotsman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after he led St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made the second team, but it was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
"But as a child I often watched with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it is something that draws me back.
The opportunity, however, can only come if I am successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously turned down presentations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''can I have this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out again."
Ross' career in management is only three years, after a period of assistant directorship at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' training staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he remembered how he had taken over Alloa's ledels.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than playing.
That sounds bizarre, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that you have to come weekly.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressure of the work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking spots and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but receipts in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA Business Consultancy, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month, June, when drinking spots were up by 2.8 percent, besides restaurants being hit even harder.
The 1.8 - percent drop in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking places and bars were far better at doing and increased more than restaurants had dropped.
Food - guided drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales went up by 6.6 percent for the month, with food going down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-house-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly difficult above and apart from constant expense.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only the time will show whether the more temperate temperatures that we have experienced since August will bring needed relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking areas and restaurants, including new sites that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, revealing a survey
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in false Insta pages
The news heightened fears of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head bill" to show parents.
One in five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo division Instagram.
The news heightened fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head bill" to show parents, but they also have private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape".
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilith Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish athletics council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track-and-fielder and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after having had a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, learned how to walk, and practice skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Borspompad version that moms compare to cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertisement that compared breast-feeding mothers to milking cows.
In celebration of the launching of what is called the "world's first silent portable chest pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-kind music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who are milking out.
Four real moms dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics such as, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you haven't seen them, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The koorgeparte says, "Pum it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the firm's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 glances and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying that it was underplaying the horrors of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
After we have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.
The Elvie-bors pump fits discreetly in a food bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another observed: "Supposely traumatized for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screaming naked."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast - fed.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another observed, "It's a nice advertisement for mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cow."
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is dead silent, has no threads or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bar that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother, observed: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a large and provocative introduction.
By moving a parallel between women who were milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking out process and all its challenges in the limelight, while in an entertaining way that people can connect with the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walking board for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of immigrant children continued to rise sharply, partly because of strong rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration, making it more difficult to place children at bailouts.
Traditionally, most bailors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was put at risk by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible bailouts and other adult members of their households should have their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of bail are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to deal with the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconferencing call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling more easily are overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tenttown without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can make the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish ‘constituents’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, is "almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this holy struggle until we cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They are politicizing something that should be merely a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement contained a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear menstrual periods" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadist, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be "cut off".
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the "checking the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In which without a doubt "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To this day, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak time viewers, at 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewing with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said I. Scovell to me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather fly jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, business chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's varying role distribution and daily cheeks in the plot (such as looking for a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, or you'll stay behind.
When I reached this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balances.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs back then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Out-of-money stream to the most exciting mid-term election races in Home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th seen an influx of money, thanks to a shift of congressional districts that now brought two officers into a race to the same seat.
The recently changed Pittsburg district makes Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another county in a special election last spring – measure strength.
Lamb is facing another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, who is heavily overflying with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally delineated in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign finance competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field March Congress Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Field March Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close-kick won in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrat a slight advantage.
U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners suspended the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the "next decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year which was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue effectively to put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or rigors from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on the basis of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible crossbumping of the dish, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also thought to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia cooperated in the country’s attack on our elections.
Would the Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he was preparing to go back before the voters, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be accomplished.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czech Republic-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years' slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy’s merciless course is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, resign?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to secretly take up the president and speculate on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly applied FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador's house at one time.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table that the swastika wears.
With that as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance from the season to the 2-2-equal outcome against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this outcome as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equal count is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a hard game, because they've had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a good sense factor at the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, last season behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Retirement Saving Fear
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a relative to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's true to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal battles off at the pass.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, empowered for your finances.
Choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It is not just the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who Will Care for the Dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windmill
A man was shot several times with a windmill as he walked home to an evening out.
The victim, in his 40's, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "eternal act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-scale tremor.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 km) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The government, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala were hit several times during the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck West Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major quake along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-fold hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused almost 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-scale quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: One of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, hit a 7.5-scale quake that led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat quake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly tremor and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took away a woman's phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held at a $500 uninsured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decided" when he was asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A offenses, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and paid $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is currently before Alaska’s Veterinary Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed to have boxed her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking her son’s conduct to PTSD as a result of his military service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-fold earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the Sulawesi center, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot hire car to launch an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to cut off pedestrians and a cyclist who was on his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight victims and "willfully" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty, lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges are punishable by possible death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, and a complaint of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "deep planning and forethought," prosecutors said and described the way Saipov carried it out as "detestable, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," mentioned the announcement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has prosecuted a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a plot to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were teased with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told detectives that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs he had to be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "sold out" as Mr. Farage Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces is to unite her deeply divided officers by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Allies demanded that she press the door in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the death penalty – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop meant the Loop-congregation in Solihull that he wanted to throw out "Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made a nobleman and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in charge, we'd be out by now,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone turned down proposals that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely untrue.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farge told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of trust between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in downtown.
Some activists waved Tories against Brexit banners after the release of the group this weekend.
Workman Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
‘It’s a total trick.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard’ to stand up for President
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard at it to stand for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts democrat talked about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that she might challenge Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with founders using the city hall format since Trump’s reign.
An attendee asked her if she was planning to stand up for president.
Warren answered that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it includes a woman at the top."
Arrested in Shooting Death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and was finally dead because of it," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 leading last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebound balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton resounds world title after team orders gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became evident the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team orders would play a major role in the races.
From Pálposis, Bottas had a good start and almost won Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive in the back of the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes later drew a round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver reluctantly risked-free saw inside the inside at risk of stamina to a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from behind the roadblock and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held on to his bands to finish quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the 44th round at the wells, but he could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did exceptional work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at a convention on Saturday about her insistence that she did not lick Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing his Supreme Court-denominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not address directly the evidence that Ford had given before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "congregated and rude and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened over the past few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at explanations and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it...No, we didn't lick it," he added, in a performance of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set out the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was licked earlier in September--but Feinstein denied that the leak had come down from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't lick her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial good and commented during Saturday night's convention: "I'm telling you what.
Maybe she doesn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-genominated, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and proposed that the democrats use the charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to take back by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to drive around to gain power and control," Mediaites reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two ends for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the battle 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee together before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied up their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost matches and when Friday evening Dundee 2-1 won in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaul aid, with David Rutherford providing the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan put the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard got them back together with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran stood together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are at home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake Friday struck the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower that swung heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to climb safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he day it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is still rising since many corpses are still under the downfalls while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Floors that reached up to six meters, Palu jerked that would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarkets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military service: “I ask your almai to work day and night to complete each job related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia aircraft accident: Air Niugini says one man is missing after a seaplane crash
The airline that managed a flight that crashed into a Pacific coastal lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said that they work with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact succession of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to walk through medium - deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air hostess panicked and yelled and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working close to improving a wharf also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to land people back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analists set timeline of the night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis together was Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "jok, because my truck was in Nashville."
Neither is an inconsistency that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He assured her of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin its final pleadings Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Enough a black person?!
NY-kindergrou sue couple because she was fired after "racist" text
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminating dismissal after she received a misrepresented message from the mother who complained that she was "yet a black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the dispute with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she learned that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEWEEEEEEEEEE A BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After discovering her error, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me from Maurice and said that their outgoing African-American nanny was doing bad work and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such a good thing," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple looked back on the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment and feared that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she did not mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to " extortion" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months' time and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
As the case continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not link readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know of Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fiery if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children’s book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication after his death was “bittersweet” for the last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-gathering man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the glory to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart lamb.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart at bay was slowly breaking up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was shutting down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't scream or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who by then was hurt for the loss of her daughter, accompanied by the other passengers on board the plane -- unaware of the trial she appreciated going.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had lowered my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work at preventing others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis ’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel as I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I worry constantly that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even though it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death had been very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It jerks a hole through the family.
It rips us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was still undecided as the FBI began investigating.
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he had asked for--a timeless investigation that had no scope--could we perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entrenched partisan accumulation.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all because of timing.
The intermediate elections are only weeks away, on November 6th - if, as is expected, the Republicans fare badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivers his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm himself to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overrun numbers 'down 'under Kim
The number of North Korean invaders to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-suck quoted data from the South's Unification Cabinet and said there were 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates requested by human smugglers was key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-definition demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Rather than refugees, China views the invaders as illegal immigrants and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the striking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on Saturday for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Histeries," says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh "Histeries" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted this way, they would say 'hysteries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and choked as he discussed his family and his high school for years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "stupid and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democratic people.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democracy won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court he's currently in," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Association Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Attributable Care or Rue b. Wade, since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions as to whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would have said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for bridle because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early work in a male-dominated office was where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman by my neck--a cold manager for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a telltal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extra-religious relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, I realized Schroeder, very frustrated, that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It had been a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Does they think I'll get the discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated by the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and angry at the sexism--that she had stabbed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried"?
How the US-Shina trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the trade war between the US and China had been deafening and, while the struggle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most interesting escalation this week rolled in with new rates that affect $200 trillion of items and effectively burden half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing was reprisals each time and recently claped rates of five to ten percent on $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet the US's requests publicly will be too much of an embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards properly, pressing over US trade war over the long-term China can positively support by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can begin an economic twelve-air in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators had previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by war for more than seven years.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation at ground level is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore to normal the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flattened land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe Seals Ryder Cup Victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and team US with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. town Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, put his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave up his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari flashed in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who might have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of any time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands over the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won US golf legend Tiger Woods two and a half in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old one," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder-beker record.
A strange statistic by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S. had a hard weekend to find the field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys.
There was time this morning when we were sitting a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hate for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat slanted.
We're outnumbered."
