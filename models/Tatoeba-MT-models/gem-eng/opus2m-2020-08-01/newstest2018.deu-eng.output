Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a crazy place where young people are supposed to meet today.
A burial chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Minor gardeners manage the former land of peasants.
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying if maps are not up to date.
Anyone who had to get upset already knows that because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer from the Bayern Geoportal of the State Government, are anything but topical - but that's why they are very revealing.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the territory of Merkur.
The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called Urposition sheets, have been included in the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to information from the Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864, these were produced from the first survey carried out by Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph moved the project forward, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian survey administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison Previous/Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was included in the Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today is the West Park, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered hallways from the so-called "survey", from which the land tax was derived.
Small plots no longer show farmers there - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sonnen" plant.
A large green area is located north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since the October Festival in 1810, was actually a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße once people with delusions were locked in.
There, 1858/59 the Munich Kreiss-Irrenanstalt "On der Auer Luften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called wrongs.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked with the institution for an exhibition.
At first 280 patients had been accommodated, later 500 seats were expanded.
Sometime this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east homes from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during World War II during bombing.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city center in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval burial chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstitch for the second S-Bahn line were done.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to today's aerial view - and the hole can be filled up at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloured People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouriers to pay particular attention and to exercise extreme caution when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred in the whole state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip through the state and was held in custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri Public Prosecutor's Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more frequent than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring bail money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program, which ranked the state as 16th in terms of the number of such injuries.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU members Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac took a picture on the spot.
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot make any profit on such steep areas.
The grassland area ensures a lot of work, a lot of work has to be done with the motor sense.
"We have to fight with conditions and topography here," said Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the Leader promotion".
For costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this could take a long time for the reforestation of the areas to be removed.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their business," said the mayor.
Farmers are often criticised for their support
In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced over the meadow fenced.
The opening area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was supported by Leader, one quarter by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You're doing a really good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter Weiss also stated: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflege directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state support of meadow fences.
The aim is to maintain the open position of the Black Forest.
A prerequisite is the presence of an LPR-designated supporter.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towable (hanging over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, the request is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build a fence just under 16 kilometres.
The open area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have listened to him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his basis.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the upsetting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your distressed masses who long to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There never was a time when the "poor waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and their friends, who were committed to putting their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-level political act.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing, in a worn-out classical pictorial representation, the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great Shrine Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night world: "Lady Liberty is moving ahead.
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the path to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh came across something here.
The importance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as seen by the exhausted, wretched, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch shall not illuminate the way, but shall kindle the hatred which is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
The UK's Performance Director for Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championships Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "he has developed something special in Scotland" and that the UK's athletics need to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they were living or training, left the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take part in their fifth World Championships at the 400-m-Hürden, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir, the medium-range runner, is leading this way and last year has drawn up five British and two European records.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shooter to be observed after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championship when the only other shooter in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be part of the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the scotches that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get up on podiums.
As far as my speech as Captain is concerned?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship.
So it's really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."
Block critics via Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot tolerate heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from internal politics to political principles.
He was barking at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783, Washington said: "Free speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan's not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called official and paid by employees with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The mail spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, M.D., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the message "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others a "consultation".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the board of supervisor of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Porto had a similar effect to that of the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers appealed to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticising his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led next to the Archerfield links to the final round last year, before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieved its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from its best side, it is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is a zealous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It feels really special," said the player from Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was removed from the program in the year after I won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floor.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went."
With the trio on the field are the former masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scotsmen on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the car park costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer due to passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) will come to this conclusion in a study.
"Our estimates are that 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smoke," said Head of Study Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he undertook his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections appear to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is quite in time," says the head of the building farm Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation was more complicated than suspected, as in the underground there is much hidden, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hampers construction work, is a major problem for the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and lock-off bars is already enormous," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the buses are entitled to transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite strenuous.
Fortunately, however, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she won't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regent in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to run around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand survey before the occupying troops.
An existing movement that fought for independence from Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated roofs, which have been transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing out their lively, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and their bright skirt.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport reduced the value of $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly US$20 million, including up to US$150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's Tribal Hochland in the 1970s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators.
"We will lose everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warning Canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up here.
"The migrants started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura Province.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in Volksmund as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmerman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuans men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They performed ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - in a circle and a bird singing imitation - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was warmed up, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto-viertel of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was under attack.
"We need to defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us," said the spokesperson of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical maladies in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that must be passed," he said.
Then Wiranto withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "crimes against humanity" demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Panai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take a unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there'll be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, according to TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend Papua's rights by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and taken into custody arbitrarily, under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are building everything they eat: especially nuts and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nut cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region usually go to the better-trained and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift reporting restrictions in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report to Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there is free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights cases."
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on May 4, locals broke their silence and distressed him "We want freedom", according to a source who also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robber military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, regard their voice for Jokovi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the Paniai victims' families carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time
A fire found its way through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years, which is by chance called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extinguished the fire and the building cooled off at 4.00 local time (00.00 GMT).
The government said that it was working to provide accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revitalise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the covering, the outer covering for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and covering on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles on only two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-satellite classics, which are often very long, but also very much appreciated, thus remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
One will continue to work to improve the competitions.
Even after many objections, not only did the vote come before the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place.
Only comparatively smaller details will be available from 2018: The finalists at the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while carrying accidentally banned knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered late that they had gone erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disobey the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent that were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were intentionally passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought banned drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it had asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidental smugglers had brought through airport security and how many had done so deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most ancient contraband - knowingly or ignorantly - by safety were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of them.
It is no surprise, then, that the largest quantity of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time announced the latest quarterly balance sheet with a different, less shiny number: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk has often recruited more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just about to begin.
Now Musk admits: Of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 euros (US$1000 and UK £1000) in full.
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not demand, but production.
Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles last year.
2018 - all models taken together - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum load.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, then the non-commitment of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing due to delaying the Obama era's emission reduction rules
One day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of air pollutants causing Smog.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency showed itself to the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to reaction rapider than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his former body in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanelecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and to set the deadline for implementation in an agreement," said Pruitt, who sued the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists to us."
Nevertheless, the EPO opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that accused the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the Smog flowing into their communities," said Schneiderman.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump government in order to defend ourselves in the interests of environmental polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlings celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlingen's friends and sponsors their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique mundane gem".
In 1267 the St. Hilariucskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg document book: Count Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a lordly court, to which the Church or the Patronate Law belonged and did not reverse.
So people also lived there.
As the description of the Upper Office of Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the townscape of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps dating back to around 1600 underpin these historical events.
The law of the Patronate arose from the law of the early Middle Ages.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This involved the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The Greater of the Two Crushed at Christmas 1673.
The newly created bell was resonated for the first time in 1692, but it had to be released later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The church's remains were threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilarius was abolished.
Only the church tower was abandoned.
In the New Year's Night of 1834, a storm split the church tower, and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cut off.
Only today's tower Zwarg remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Reinnern" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn are the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens invite you to the sixth serenade on Sunday, July 16, at the old cemetery to the St. Hilariucskapelle.
It is designed by the Combo des Kepler-Gymnasiums Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance starts at 3:30 p.m.
To the exclusion of the Serenade, a roundabout takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers will showcase the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for dummies and earphones.
The friends and sponsors of Tummingen feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to check approval of windmills
"Boisheim resists itself" sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim Gewert gewert" invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette since, at the time in Viersen, there had only been a wind-power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the remaining urban area.
These zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the countryside.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the consent issued is still illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of the art: The City Council once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of an approval for the construction of wind turbines is prohibited by planning law at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by Viersen County since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to result in the procedure being stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not wish to comment on the argument of the association "Boisheim resists itself" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans the construction of four wind wheels, each 200 metres high, on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved had signed leases with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be met - which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
The NEW Re intends to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and Tractor Crack Together: Woman Dies in Horrible Accident
A terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The state road was blocked for hours.
According to police records, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich travelled the L 333 towards Bogel in the course of her accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother.
City and Dealer Plan Home Shops Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will re-discover shopping in the city center in September.
The Gewerbeverein and the Stadtverwaltung want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the shopping mall.
As the president of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shoppen" weekend is supposed to raise customers' awareness of what offers the own city has to offer beyond the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the "Mitternachts-Shoppen".
The action is not just aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the end of the campaign, says Christian König.
City administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
This means that the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive city center".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" to the well festival, as well as open Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city centre when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to reviving the city centre - to landlords, to the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was possible to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had partly spread, had said king in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities were participating for the first time on the third "home shopping day" in Germany.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day was to "advertise for the appreciation of local commerce and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," says String.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his/her direct environment with his/her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the fire brigade, on Wednesday (local time) was still a critical injury.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed during the explosion.
A first missing person was later also saved dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a consequence of the accident, the authorities suspected that work was being done on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for the payment of the border walls after having been screened from phone calls.
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly denounced the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA, and vowed to pay Mexico for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia was to take on "stupid", "maiden" and "stupid" and that the existence on the trade, which was conveyed by the Obama government, would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the transfer of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massacks: Activists relaunch racist Lynchakt as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and clung to Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-strap suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked at the windshield.
Inside, the occupants floated in fear.
"We want this n--- r Roger!" the man roared.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shouts torn the silence when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replica.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience cast out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murder.
"It's really incredible that no one person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of restitution.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong citizen.
For him, the reproduction serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want law enforcement, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot attain healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical examiner lays a bedclothes over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time on the pre-election campaign in summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement, which was not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and obscured the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more eloquently.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their presentation is vivid, catchy and is founded in a kind of deep racism, many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look at, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching, because we are then confronted with its uglyness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or if you don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He's been playing the role of the leader clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who screams at Hester and haunts him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get away from my property!"
Rascona returns the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs loudest.
"What?" Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't believe that white people at the time said 'n--he'."
"But," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts in space, a feeling of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple have arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many only come down the street.
They have all experienced nearly eight hours of georgia's oppressive moisture when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are standing on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song stop, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children cling to their heads, register the counterfeit blood and the silent body and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynch rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his co-workers and then tears together in her arms, finally breaking through the emotional burden of the performance.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience meets the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chattered about the replica with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What it really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The imitation is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is true that if we do not learn anything from it, it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerians reconciled in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful, frivolous production in front of a gigantic six-story setting.
The turntable (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a sloppy street corner with wall residue and donnerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parked in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively a isetta.
Stacked oil barrels remind of Castorf's leitmotiv - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" production.
The three Rheindötter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), tearing a body into the trunk in Hollywood style and giving the Krawallo Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully ugly Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beats Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Oake) still has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows their hands to Merkel's rawness, are celebrated stormily.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is shown for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in low leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was eagerly expected.
If he had had to have a valid pipe concert over him in 2013, there were five years later great cheers in which the single "Buh" called went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have enjoyed it.
"It is noted that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in a certain way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience had not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown in understanding of his view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I'm dealing with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're now 26 years old, so you're a late-time volunteer.
How's that?
Quantity: I have done abitur.
And then a architectural study, let's say, successfully discontinued.
I realized that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I asked myself, what are you doing?
Make a social year, there is an insight, because you can see how it is on the ground, in the focus maybe, really.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social services in the winter semester.
I'm going to study dual, probably do a social worker training in the youth office at Herne and study at Hamm University of Applied Sciences.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of employment during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you're doing your FSJ.
You can do it from old age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in architectural studies?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people shaped their heads, each with a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always address it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that is how life is.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces the dividend to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would cut down another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
The job cut, which Director General John Fallon announced mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for a further £300 million (394 million) in a third cost reduction programme to revive a business that was hit by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it increased from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoy attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attempt
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and one interpreter had been injured, announced a statement by NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the incident in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last act of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement states that the explosion on Thursday evening occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosion carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable condition and are treated in the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of which were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombardment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack since the US-led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide attacks in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its politics and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPO shall reverse the decision to delay the Smog rule after actions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has lifted a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, which requires States to contain Smog-causing emissions. This took place one day after 15 states sued the agency for the step.
The EPO announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "zone regulations 2015" and said that it was showing the Agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to postpone by one year until October 2018 the determination of the ozone requirements - which are to be measured in part of the country's pollutant emissions in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to stimulate economic growth according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing in air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Community Council wants Community
In the end, the decision was clear: in two votes against, the municipality council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a community area in the future old-age housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property has been signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take until the area belonging to the church community is in municipal ownership, there is now no planning obstacle to the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to come to the community.
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering before providing such a common space not only as a meeting place for the inhabitants of senior housing but openly into the community.
As an example, the word from the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was taken by means of the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be wasted by means of funding.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
According to Tjaden, the establishment of a Community area would be eligible for 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision, in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown between his legs in this respect, foresees the conclusion that both saddles - which is based on the environment - as well as pult roof - would be possible, which would reduce the height of work and make construction more economical.
Needless, not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is necessary.
If it helps, it happens unanimously to the body.
It's not that simple in the community room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which one does not get along quite properly, for which one now leans in the common room from the window, she says: "I am doing hard with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to anyway assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land one does not grant a grant, but gets a real equivalent marketable in case of doubt, is the opposite.
Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
For example, two votes against the original programme that Stefan Haller sums up: "If we make the decision this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Wheelers are thrown on the road
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught in Garath by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had arrived at 12.20 a.m. by bicycle on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg road from the direction of Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter-trafficking.
He collided with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a reconnaissance car.
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from David Alabama and Thiago at the Supercup versus Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba must have the game shot against Dortmund.
FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season with personnel care.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Cup winner.
Prior to the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport), the personnel care of the German football record champion Bayern Munich is growing.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, there are no miners Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game".
The duel of the two German football swordweights attracts the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the Harz from star to star
In the resin, the first "star trail" is to be created nationwide.
The association St. Andreasberg plans this.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star trail" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper resin.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail train is to be extended by train.
"On the star trail, viewers learn a lot about the physics of the stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more brightly than another, although it lies much further away.
It will also be transmitted which constellation is in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest-ranking observatory in northern Germany.
According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda-Galaxie are clearly visible with the naked eye.
Since 2003 there has been something similar in the University of Göttingen at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Funding Association as the planned Star Werg - the Planetary Way.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet trail leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality like) with the planet Sedna.
The stelaes with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are precisely positioned at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fix star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaakko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomaakko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Lightweight Championship, went down the hall to welcome Lomaenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Championship.
According to Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomaakko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19:00 on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomaakko-Manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former spring weight," said Garcia.
"I have risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give it to them."
Lomaakko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climates asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomaakko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 Knockouts) that also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed themselves openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said that he valued Lomaakko as "a huge fighter," and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomaakko continued with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he was looking at Riverside's three-fight champion's "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show punch strength, then boxing.
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomaakko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four Victims by Tyre Placer
In the event of an accident on the A7, four people were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the connection point.
The car slid to the right into the thug, where he crossed over and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, and then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 for the start of the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will bring in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, with the result also, if not the two countergates had been 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"These were two countergates too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says Fortuna Dusseldorf's defense player.
In the Erzgebirge, the three-chain is to be further optimised.
And a gate after a free shot, the Fortunes don't want to catch up either.
"For the future it will be that no one stands on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better equipped to cope with the preparation of the tricycle than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to operate in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his business, "because we have players who can build up well right now in the tricycle chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"Constraint is, but that we are even more harmonious and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction."
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an indecision, don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we can stand at four points on Sunday and concentrate on the trophy, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season start."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I don't judge the start of the season until after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite ascent in the bones.
"But they don't know as much as 100 percent where they are right now," says the internal defender of Fortuna.
While guests from the Rhineland as a lighter favourite on Sunday go to the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we took them away just because we have the right to be among the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose balance at only one defeat against the nine-game Aue is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the front," explains Fortuna's chief coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Forensic Medicine Agency) started conducting the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were underage.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age.
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 years old does not necessarily mean that the applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "suggest that the person surveyed was 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't act as if we could," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is low.
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full on the Plan
The works on the three bridges of the 108 Landstraße between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road Transport and Transport at the government bureau Freiburg.
In April, the works started at the same time on all three refurbishment bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The builder is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge, lined with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red Buntsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
On Wednesday morning on the north side, the bridge at the entrance to the town of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20-metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the footpath is to run.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special sensation of fingertips has required the laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable running there, to which many companies are connected.
In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed by handbills about the project.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is gradually regulated by a traffic light.
For construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance to the village, the road is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put under one's hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the Vulkaneifel district day belong to a broad alliance, which on that day shows a peaceful flag, because the AfD invites Rondell in the Gerolstein City Hall to the "big campaign act" according to the poster.
And well-known names are starting - like Alice Weidel, who, together with Alexander Gauland, is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the event starts on the ground do not want to listen to the AfD learners but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the well square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the key organizers, is really happy: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without any problems," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Vulkaneifel that he had sought such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for parking in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the round table, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
This is also true: around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz, in the Stadthalle several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but also there is scheduled to clean up shortly after 21:00.
The police can go down - no special incidents.
Trompette meets trompette
A rehearsing with the Wolfach tromboneist Frederic Belli can be found in the series Haslacher Monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or also "Balkanfolklore" meets a classic German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo composer of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new costume, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" is united with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by Jazzecho Prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the programme was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monastery Church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything out," said Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"If I bite in grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'."
The Hollywood star's most famous relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually broke up bitterly.
Despite all of this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school when she preferred to dress like a bob: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bob.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Mother, be proud of you!'."
Especially to the public she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as a West Virginian resident that I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"In the morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited coal from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of parties by Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would stop us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, united message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world-wide head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships, Russia's Athletics Chief Dmitry Shelkhtin said that the banishment of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were taken away in competitions gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of State-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players in the athletics world championships, which start on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for readjustment.
Drug testing was still insufficient and banned trainers were still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sacrifice of soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domstadt under high security arrangements.
The defence minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unexplained cause of the crash.
She described the two lost pilots as "the master of her profession".
"We are bowing down to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hesse had died on Wednesday a week ago in West Africa Mali.
Her wounds were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of Saint Peter on Thursday accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr.
At noon, only the members of the church said good-bye.
Afterwards, the celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as politics.
These included Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid roses down, the relatives stood arm in arm at the ulcers.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defense of the Leyen called the dead soldiers "highly decorated" and experienced operations.
The Chief of Staff had built up the operations of Tiger's fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six tiger pilots trained in his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this crew could not prevent the crash, then no one would have been able to do it."
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister von Leyen that the use was dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the wounds were taken from the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish Royal Couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed to her husband's decision, and the communication continued.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a heel out of being not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016, he retired, leaving the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last retirement place of the 83-year-old will be finally, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames at the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathies of the people, Prince Henrik, in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes, was in a difficult position.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which were called here to be the brand of social critical intellectuals, I could not hope for reluctance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsens Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is following the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid re-election of the Landtag, but he does not want to resign.
That is why we voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on Friday.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her Landtag Group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official election date, the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-voice majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten founded her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hanover.
Mr Björn Thumler, Head of the CDU Group, would like to recommend that his group be included.
The CDU and FDP have 69 seats in the Landtag of Lower Saxony, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected regularly on January 14th next year.
Thumler said that the red-green state government would now have to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Landtag withdrawing the confidence of the Prime Minister and choosing a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be assessed legally cleanly," said Thumler.
"You will be able to discuss all the questions in peace if they have been examined in a reasonable legal manner."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something curious".
The politician herself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She was a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the abject Members to return to their country's mandate.
"We assume, of course, that she will return her country mandate, which she has received via the Green Country List, with immediate effect," said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group chairperson of the Green Anja Piel said: "We very much regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She has deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Dutch Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," said the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The departure of Twestens costs the majority in Red-Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests for the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU participates in this dirty intrigue in Lower Saxony and tries to beat political capital out of it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group leader, Björn Thumler, would like to recommend to his MPs that Elke Twesten be included in the CDU.
The head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the result of the 2013 Landtag election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) will present a speech and an answer in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamping.
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Foodwarnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the egg charters concerned.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after all we know at present, a health hazard is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the informer is not really being played by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's interest.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade must ensure, as well as manufacturers, that the products sold are marketable and health-friendly.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they shall not be capable of being transported.
However, uncongested eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly liable.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage from the allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers.
Is there a lack of staff or responsibility?
It was the official controls that have revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 percent.
That is why a consistent clarification of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alertism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
As a result of the planned funding, manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels.
I expect from all competent authorities that the matter will be quickly and completely clarified.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization that has overseen the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must eventually prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money so that Neymar can sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich family of rulers of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the debts of the clubs to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher business.
During the current three-year FFP allocation period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen into disrepute from the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin continues to work to discourage excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, in relation to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the repayment for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million can be recorded in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 was met by the PSG with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by outsmart their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catharic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments made by the World Cup 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could be easy to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said the people who are familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best footballers go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsenal Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new forest supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report by the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" of Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and checked for quality.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the spokesperson.
About 17 million small red-white box boards packed with 14 grams each year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
In the industry, according to "Northwest Switzerland", the order volume is estimated to be between 1.5 and 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
However, the advertising effect is all the more important: For a Shoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender does the Swiss not want to reveal.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Chocolate boards have been distributing Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class beak passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed on the short distance by Chocolate Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic Champion Robert Harting achieves World Cup finals
The three-time World Champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, failed in the national World Cup competition and was only able to watch the discus competition from the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes to the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-year-grunge era (when the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stepping to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who are growing up - they still managed to make it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the molding cannon principle, including a reef on the Stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Shakes the Cradle").
At one point, a character appears through an Apple Powerbook, some inline estimates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-bore plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-perfect impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun to see the young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip from "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It is the moments of random madness that could excite this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde", and even "GLOW" with its East-West ring-fighting iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates being a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-rooted Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice Gags to see (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
At six long episodes it pulls over, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lesser length, could deliver its agitprop satires better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a living.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Beating Drug Mafia in the Country
The police have succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutors told Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and sent to arrest.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspect Italians.
The two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in operation.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating Konstanz against organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo also accompanied the large operation.
In particular, Italian nationals were closely associated with the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the account of the gangs.
How to complain of large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the alien register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This led to some serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures.
According to Frank-Jürgen Weise, the Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, has pointed out a media report that there are major gaps in the Central Register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could result in "to some extent serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, cautioned in an analysis presented by the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are then managed by about 600 alien authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been properly maintained, data quality had not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 had been found, "by people who have not been alive for a long time, or by citizens who have become German citizens and who should actually no longer appear in the register".
"Errorful data input can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
In addition, statistics on people leaving the country included EU citizens who would not have to leave at all.
However, such misrepresentations led "to a distorted debate on the handling of expedients", according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under the age of 16 when they arrived from there.
This is reflected in an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper thus states that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "on families with children - except for infants and grandchildren - back to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically impossible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU Member State they first reach.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, he can be sent back to the country of entry.
To justify this, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU Member States would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political spokesperson of the left-wing group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Family with children is threatened by human rights violations and child welfare threats due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system.
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already made the blood donation service available to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded the prize on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the congregation acknowledges the multiplicity of willingness to donate blood.
"It is ingenious how our body is designed to do this, and we show respect for the donors who make their blood available to strangers, yet unselfishly so," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit representative of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned food is divided into its components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the head of the DRK circuit readiness.
Obviously, the change to the theater house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were already among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half as many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave off their life juice ten times per 500 millilitres.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation slows down speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "distant" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the autumn.
But it signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be needed to offset the inflation heated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make more 15 billion pounds available under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on real household income continues to exert pressure on consumption."
With regard to interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something greater" level than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "progressively" and "limited".
The downturn in the bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It continued its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly by the end of the year after the bank.
The recent report on inflation was not enthusiastic about households affected by rising inflation and low salary increases, as the increase is getting even worse before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy will not be able to "prevent" the decline in income in the next few years, but she added that wages will be "clearly" recovered by the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate some of the lower consumer expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for this to be achieved in full by prices and the economy.
Prior to the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates had increased as inflation increased the pressure on heavily underprivileged households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% was to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are looking loudly for business and want to end the year positively.
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment starting in September following a fight against the financing of the drug in the NHS before the High Court.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself ready to finance the trial after the appeal court confirmed last year a judgment of the Supreme Court, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "distinguishing moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is widely used, taken up and implemented in a targeted manner.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress that has continued for more than three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people who are in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who is at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to stop the spread of HIV in society a step closer'.
Living the Great Life: Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room presence with a layered layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a middle floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place of life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the specification.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but about building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous residential area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses from Joanne.
By observing a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It's counter-weight, so when you push the door up, it glides very lightly."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical sockets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing with good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave them.
Brothers are fighting for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a heated debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act says that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed hearings.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but urges Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants, who had dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years at high school when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, whereby Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark were embittered, Paul says, "about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin has been very restrained, although he was a former AFL member of the board of directors and, after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in front of the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information on President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first working day, he was a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television lasts decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was annoyed by unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," said former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees managed to keep trouble away from him several times, then their efforts paid off.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, constantly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - quite concerned with this story - reported in May about the preferences of the consultants to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stifling himself to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet lawyer Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of harassment, or offered no concrete evidence, or made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to interview employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "suggested to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a Priebus manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most Wanted Criminals Get Post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be sought and hoped for.
The police across Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer (virtual).
Since the addresses of the serious criminals sought are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and asked for.
Europol reported on Friday's action following the winter 'EU Most Wanted' Advent Calendar.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations, said Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online applicants have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionaires Series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again standing on the war foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a moat drawn by the church to demand a field back in front of their mansions.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a grave excavated by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have urged the advice of Solihull, who said that it is "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park."
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with Solihulls police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closing of the hotel Birkenhof by the then ambience company mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30 000 nights per year were lost at that time and also revenues from the tourist tax.
In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the number of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at the time.
But especially the Mayor of Freudenstadt Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke to serious interested people at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyous city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Your name is Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were demolished, some ceilings were demolished, some old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There's still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is remodeled, new windows are installed.
Everything was to become "beautiful citizen", as Thomas Scherer put it.
"We want to make a jewel out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a conference room are among the amenities.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated city centre level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 or so rooms, wants to set up wide, Scherer further explains.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer.
The city's ideas were identical to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision.
Just under a million euros, he calculates.
The outside systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia business: US special investigators are using Grand Jury
According to a report, Special Investigator Robert Mueller was reported to have used a so-called Grand Jury in Russia's business around US President Donald Trump.
The body has taken up the work over the past few weeks, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people familiar with the matter.
The paper rated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there were already first launches of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of having been actively involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted as advisor to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also looked at more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator had personally brought Trump to the centre and investigated the allegation that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to bring an action.
Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecutorial chambers.
They are usually switched on when they are larger and controversial.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to the hearing under oath.
According to the transmitter CNN, preloads have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons attending the meeting were invited to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election leader Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily be said that the Grand Jury was finally turned on in order to decide on the imposition of an accusation.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats a chance to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about".
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House is in favour of any measure that accelerates the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president was not being determined.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed about this, as stated in the statement.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump had fired Comey.
As a result of this raid, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wants to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later-retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the pressure of the President.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, according to which the Special Investigator could no longer be so easily released.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg Drives in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg has disintegrated from the Schelfeis of almost seven times the size of Berlin.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The coloss of over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers now drives north and will probably take two, three years before it melts.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.
However, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice-skeletons in the region, writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming.
The now abandoned Colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this Shelfeises, the balance of growth and disruption was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete schlfeis had fallen apart there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far back as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase sea level, as it swims on the water, and ice dissipates as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the Schelfeise causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British Antarctic Observation Research Project (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice-cream in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.
That's where it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, there was controversy as to whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not bring the collapse of this gigantic iceberg back to climate change, many of the Antarctic peninsula's ice-creams have collapsed in the past decades.
This long tip of the Antarctic extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees over the past 50 years, counting to the areas where the temperature rises fastest.
CDU wants house rate for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill job vacancies, the CDU is calling for an exit from the employers' association in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the district day waved through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching places in the circle are apparently very sought after.
Some 620 applications were made for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle lacks further staff to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in Mettmann County.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.
The CDU, together with the FDP and the UWG, now wants to take the initiative and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
At the request of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for the acquisition and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of skilled workers, but to address the shortage of applicants in the future.
The overall approach should focus on both the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cross-border beginners and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know so much earlier.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a regular "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of staff who leave the service due to illness or age.
So there is a maximum time for action so that more jobs are not left unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently made a big surprise on the day of the circle when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and astonished the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed that allow a exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should seek a house rate," people said.
This means that the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, which is based on career years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy sharpens the tone of NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs, who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they must not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to make detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on social media.
"We can only judge all accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew will take on-board inflatable migrants who will be delivered directly by traffickers and that smugglers will be able to disembark so that the ships can be re-used.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about any "essential changes or handicaps" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organisation is doctors without borders (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Austoffposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
The viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfalzer Forest and the upstream plains.
In between there were longer and longer increases for the long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the vantage point was at the vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate rises.
On the last two days, many altitude meters were once again in demand.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing sole into the open air inhaler.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Do the sports stars face computer consoles in the future, instead of perspiring at wind and weather to fight over the stadium lawn?
The fact is: E-sport has long become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high streets included.
This has also been recognised by the first Bundesliga associations, which are increasingly engaged in this field.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later the FC Schalke 04 and later the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the VfB," says the Management Board Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure "that on this train a number of clubs are still on the rise".
Next weekend, the FIFA Football Association in London will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in which the players of different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris have qualified Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-trainer from Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual footballers.
"The real football must especially deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present online on these markets far more often than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
During the e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike", or football simulation FIFA will be fought at the competition level.
Long ago, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves, in which the professionals oppose each other.
And at the Asia Games 2022 E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is this really a sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of familiarity.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction skills are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players are international on the move, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be 130 million.
This is not much against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league.
However, the e-sport "was no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already continuing.
Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basket players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the Unikrn eSport betting provider.
There are also many things that are happening in Europe.
E-sports had been introduced in a Norwegian school as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Soccer Firstliga Associations are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and telling the old times, is no longer enough.
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football stays the way it always was."
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal states are affected by the scandal around poisoned eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are proven not to contain fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter's conviction of the texts that urge Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and phone calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-facing eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the state attorney told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she totally regrets".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that their "age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy saying that there is "no day on which I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will carry with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she was "pursued" by the realization that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
"No longer having this only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always have with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stand up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 to murder her British resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lamm of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to appear as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern has a big season in which to win the Confed Cup - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something else was there at his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional garment was very, very small.
But since there was of course no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to see on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made the tie he had assigned to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the Confed Cup winner afterwards, after his first engagement as Bayern captain.
Well, the stand could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also mean Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been selected as a leader in the C-Elf, which was made up of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from the holiday.
Sugar is best distributed to those who have a lot of confidence in what they want to keep to themselves.
So those who have been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini-lam.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this start-up formation as the one who can also best handle the row.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed force.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (feeling little); Renato Sanches with getting on the devils with the performances of the Asia-travel (also only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not showing up negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern-trichot.
At least that worked out very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy up in front of the defense, both acting sovereign.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to be successful in the game construction a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "For this style I was also picked up".
As unusually this Bayern-world is still for the new arrivals, it was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the Catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crunchy statements in the back of his new co-players.
There he heard an interesting phrase from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern you just have to win every game".
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alabama Motivates ÖFB Dams
David Alabama believes in the success of our ÖFB-Damen
Austria's most famous footballer reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the ÖFB-Damen all the best.
The Bayern-Legionary is a kind of clubmate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and shares with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Perhaps our ladies could use the famous Bayern Dusel well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association Trierer Unternehmens (VTU), says: "Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest turnaround is in infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure, and until 2021, building law will stand.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to start the route in December 2020, says Ministerial Spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide for supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives to create a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been falling for ten years.
Wissing also has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is foreseen for the passed master's examination and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of master's training.
However, the list of house duties for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary personnel," says Jan Glockauer, IHK Trier's main manager.
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing at the Landesbetrieb Mobility, only 29 are currently employed.
The IHK calls for more orders to be given to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, CDU Group Vice, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, which in 2017 and 2018 invests more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
In addition, the previous expansion of broadband in the country was sobering.
In 2016, regional companies rated the power supply in an IHK survey with only 3,4.
They complain about mounting internet connections and disconnects.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she cleared the field after four months of inconsistency.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company considered that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with embezzling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen that caused the use of so-called cut-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but were driven back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been accused, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe, and an issue focused on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be a major burden on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to join in, a raft passes through Munich on the morning of Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws again to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large raft there between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building council wants to clarify.
On the raft you see a large information transparency.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love Is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild flow.
Last summer, the river crossed the Isar and this year, too, there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's nostrils and laughing at the suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon characters, the nodules of his characters are his trademark.
With 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he beat himself through, among other things, as a drawing for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.
Large round murderillo figures are in drawings with the disk tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits on the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, plush animals and watches, his dirty figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fistser as a counterpart.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he puts on the TV series, which, like its original drawings, is produced wordless.
Provence Lavender Threatened by Climate Change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an effect on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Not only does lavender oil attract holidaymakers, it is also very requested for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
Solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year-old existence this year.
The festival highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, Zünfte, Handelser, Vaganten or a national camp should be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa by the organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of a 2009 attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and feelings of belly are sufficient.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartel, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter are her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutorship was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only started two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan freely.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to the newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do with so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there always at the same table.
Now they ask, Was his love for the routine his destruction?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "There is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days earlier it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the government expenditure that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-ranking cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had considered the Valdez column to be the best-informed source of kidnapping.
"In the past, we already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on footpaths and buildings.
On this day the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked for it to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "encircled" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organized crime.
Last year, the media watch group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to conclude how the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are chased, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue their work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum.
A number of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the bordsteinkante they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.
The cover page had to be changed the next day.
Siren yelling up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police officers who were keeping watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his lead.
"How can you just close your mind," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "disturbed past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the Creeding Period.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has fallen asleep," said chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered with a armor and similar to a changing tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countercoating, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, indicating that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosauri family made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the coloration, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the coloration is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far greater than that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use the coloration - think of deer, zebras or belting animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosarier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed Age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Creeping Age.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just wiggled with your eyes, you could almost believe he's asleep."
The Creed period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the current biology journal, believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was buried on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch long laces that rapped off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swimming through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover bumpy tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.
The fossilised remains of the skin still cover the hollow pan plates that carry the animal’s skull.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the scales on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: mass carambola on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carmage.
There are many injured, miles of traffic jams and forks.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass carmage on the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first report, about 5 p.m. between the connecting points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were intertwined.
The exact number of injured persons was initially not available.
It's about slight to moderate injuries, said a police officer.
A great deal of lifeboats were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre-long backstave formed.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive handicaps on the counterrail - due to numerous Gaffers.
The fire department noted the vehicle handlebars’ identification marks, which are now due to sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's ever experienced: nothing imagining you're sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you've got a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and awakens a disgust or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket check.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unscrupulous ticket control.
You simply confirm by phone that you are taking your seat and devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer arrives, let's expand it.
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort Check-in" is the name of the ticket disclaimer without a recruiter.
In order to be able to use it, however, some prerequisites have to be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers do anyway.
You also need to buy it via the app of the train that DB Navigator has bought, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking tickets.
And last of all, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic evaluation will then appear at the test customers.
On their mobile devices, the train attendants receive a message that passenger X is in the train and has occupied the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket check-in, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can go back to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"Who would like to travel by our train crew without ticket control, simply check in at the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal on the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Director of DB Farnverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs".
Those who often drive a train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you need to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the creator in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same track are not yet fully accessible.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whoses Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the one in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Confused, as no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She dropped off her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unsecured his gun and shouted, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and we can call it typical."
At that moment, I felt shivering.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two of them would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whoses Streets?", in the movies from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance that consists of the view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people had to fight for what they believed?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed not only to know activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black female child.
I feel like I'd be doing her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a campground when the activists were waiting for Officer Darren Wilson's possible non-prosecution.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who had lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating rights and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to mind by Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area who is known for his activism around death-travel inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whoses Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who talks to us or talks to us. We're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - they proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whoses Streets?" surprisingly reveal personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lifes-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black gay women have to bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
She insists, however, that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who shook up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she clings to a song and she feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains."
From "dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone splits the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Coldly, the subject hardly leaves one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the one says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schasten), comes from the other side: "Does not use human beings" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Great fool!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Farmermarkthalle is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work this will be finished.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "For many years we have been buying almost weekly in the Farmermarkthalle.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwives always very much like.
We also discovered the mitzvahs for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is.
The Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the level of rent.
But it is not likely to be low on the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where are shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I find this unnecessary.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we remain in the market hall at least.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what's left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Farmermarkthalle go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the spun bit gallery already manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg before?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anybody either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanity of many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer fit.
When the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A matching resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuously alike - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former intelligence analyst fined a 35-year prison sentence after she published classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and ground-breaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has created, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone might look with these genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but since her puberty talked openly about identifying as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was obviously unwell sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of aliens from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stump and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum became unequal friends of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually be demanding Manning's release in a military prison in Kansas just a few days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further ignite the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand foot of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in its own room, is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone from the disciplines of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they keep your speech cold, they'll win," it says.
"So never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University for killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who is sought as a suspect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago has been stabbed with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murders for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site of the incident, and detectives investigate the stings as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Since 2007, Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem had now been on leave and had been excluded from joining the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and are willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every conceivable way."
The statement added that Warren's colleague was shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Square building who had just received a puzzling tip, saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - the Russian Vice Premier Mutko
The Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of the WADA to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, there is nothing to worry about for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything has been implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren into allegedly state-sponsored dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has encountered an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia during the Doping scandal in November 2015.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi no longer sells eggs for now
The groups informed of this.
It was a purely precautionary measure, which could no longer be expected to have a health impact, the communication stated.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to have been tested negative for fipronil anti-lysing agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next over
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or, worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board of directors directly.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill up why.
Companies come to realize that the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up converter that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the Uber fall in discredit.
Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convert lets companies send customized "pull" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the hot maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the principal manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convert.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convert for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree vision in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convert offer your software as a service, and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the agreement of venture capital investors who have both supported startups.
Convert received $10 million in the February financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus raising the entire capital to $47 million.
Glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts in workplace culture.
But the data is useless if a company's managers do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and motivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And whoever you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about glint, Erret.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly getting new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bonding of employees in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It's on 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have stripped their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of the players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
That is why the first three training sessions of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras spent six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put this enormous burden on her for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep plowing, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which in view of the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent car park and the neighbouring Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been thrown with footballs that cleared a protective network behind a tortoise, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in Parking 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party factual auditors and then display their results under the original article, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to factual auditors that may display the results of the factual examination from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was started in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge of which stories are being challenged by third party fact-finding experts, people want to make more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related articles" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was on display in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopharist Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he laments.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book by Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have my welcome greeting a little overrated") this all seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Husey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it to the attic".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who had what: "One could think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.
Guys, let everything go its way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was depicted from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty geeks, making debts over and over again and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise."
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to get through the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Covered over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"How nice for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their yesterday-opened website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on to say.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable uniqueness."
Finally, it competes with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium of five-digit amounts for its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officers' corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, the Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government.
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the reins in the military.
Although Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been decommissioned.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections with the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wired puller of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the coup trial, this week in Ankara.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had already called the overthrow attempt a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "cleanse the forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unbehagen in the Military Main Quarter".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on towels for soldiers, the paper wrote.
The big clean-up of the army and the security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 state servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the real lords of the country.
Three times they took advantage of their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military's power step by step, not least on the basis of the reform provisions of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan is actively pushing forward an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a not-named officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there is doubt in the Alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army about the willingness to use it.
The leadership structures and operational skills were "weaked", say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions for family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US is spending Green Cards on citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racetrack shuttle
Over and over the past few months, the future of the race trip shuttle had been challenged - now it is time to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the marooned track on which the tourist train travels.
In order to secure the future of the racing trip shuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will start on the track this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this important connection for tourism in particular," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track at around EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, says Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"The timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are thus negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company was concluded for an 11-year period.
This means that the race path shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In the past few months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also highly constructionable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just as you thought it couldn't get any worse in 2017, a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we'll see them even more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and choose everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's getting even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as possible," the True Companion website swears.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, attached to conversation or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjugated female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step on Frigid (here: resisting) Farrah, troubles one the most.
On his website True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, then why can men not have Roxxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and their increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain on the verge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the periphery can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap in the fact that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a President in the White House who has boasted of having sexually attacked women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magdalene's Report') is not the graphic pictures, the devoured bodies and the protruded eyes, but the realistic effect of this vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human that they are imitating the movement of a real body.
But, pointed out when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You cannot separate from your companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, you are a desirable slave.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: maids
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a binsenwissenity of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US election have also split families in small format.
Around Christmas and the Thanksgiving Festival there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's chosen relatives.
We all allegedly work hard to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but I find it in a further context that this also involves significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the shocking effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bitches will no longer reject us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Republicans of the right wing, who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reason compared to his standards.
Today I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's rudimentary version of the crazy - the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of which, compared to Trump, are actually a very mild crime.
When Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are whimpery and the animals twist to look with fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clapping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not satisfy the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in northern London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strange magical experience, since here two two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is necessary.
The poor woman in the department store was sorry to grin while I was tired of the experience of reaching her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists, he was taken to the hospital, which according to the prison authorities suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to death for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his girlfriend to be a night intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention of this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, which they say is too reckless.
The national law enforcement authority said that it would raise an objection at the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger Schools, the four-chatterers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools.
Three of the dropout students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
Headmaster Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle to grow up in the chicken farm, but then to be released into freedom.
For this purpose, the cheerful crowd performed a musical titled "The Eagle in the Chicken Court".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke down, and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's studies.
The hens danced with the young geckos carrying cylinders around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said Headmaster Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other juveniles (chickens), it belongs to it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
There was a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps coming in on lessons, and the parents' representatives.
The time for chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of teaching, she refused to let her students go because it was a really great time.
In the end, she could have relied on the fourth graders.
Finally, all students heard a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-classes have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal camping, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, informed.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal campers was arrested in Sithonia by the police, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have stepped up control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will be continued throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the exhaust behaviour of Euro 5 and Euro 6 emission classes cars.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the Federal Motor Transport Agency (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but not yet a precise date.
Daimler has informed each person concerned to write down.
If an inspection is required anyway, it will be carried out within its framework.
How long should the upgrades go?
"Swear to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and political pressure.
"Because we have seen automakers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
According to Smetanin, it is likely that foreign producers would move.
Is there now a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But right in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there have been no losses in the value of older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who was known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced that he would not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to deprive them of the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's mayor, will retire next year.
The job is already out of print - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been the town builder for 31 years.
And the work is still a great pleasure to him, as he conveys in the press.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks that await his successors.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
At the earliest possible time, the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer.
Thus, taking into account the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for a revision.
As Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present appropriate conclusions.
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But close to the city and it itself is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good business climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have gathered, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the building office and his employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: for example, the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz has begun.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will beat up with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," says Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successors.
The work here is fun."
There is great room for a mayor of the city.
Haslach's own farm and gardening can be used to react to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the outgoing mayor emphasizes.
After all, the mayor has a high responsibility.
He's a client, "in the end, everything is going over my table."
With care and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (high-rise construction) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the place and stay".
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If Roland Wacker wants to inherit, according to the information of Haslach City, he should be able to complete his studies as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor of Arts in Architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building regulations and building planning law.
The city building office is subject to construction and civil engineering, construction planning, basic business matters, management of urban properties, urban farm with construction yard and urban gardening, and Lower Building Law Office including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: Südbahn track locked
According to the police, the so far unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.
Close to the crime scene a pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a lousbubenstrich," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train movement.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement services, the rail customers could also be paid to the perpetrators.
The speaker said that the total was based on a "significant" sum.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without hindrance.
Almost ten passenger trains had expired on Friday morning, two of which involved long distance transport.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are compensated for by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial artery - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan should promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel disease, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of bats had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was separate, but had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were sequenced by DNA and six bacterial species were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them in the mice.
mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they were missing a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cell, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolite known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the lining of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the Tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of Tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genie" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, when Nemanja Matic signed a "Genie", Jose Mourinho believes that after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pre-arranged as desired.
Matic, however, was excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four key new commitments.
"I thank the club for getting three out of four," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've given themselves great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising in the past.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections.
Just no bonfire from the party center, just no headwind from the federal government - this was the most important wish of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz is the leader of the party, this has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching the events in the SPD-regulated state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in a counterwind.
It was deep.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber of the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising withdrawal of a Green MEP has brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landtag election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the abstinent Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electorate's will.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs a SPD electoral fighter when the new Job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, will be present without a majority of government after the Green MEPs have been transferred to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Miser started with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades back then.
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different.
It was then - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the dungeon, the Düsseldorf-Pleite killed the party smoothly.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades came back to life.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD governor, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything that you can do wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.
So now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust transactions and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been critical for a long time.
Mistakes were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried more and more in recent weeks to put accents in the League.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also remained hidden in the vicinity of Martin Schulz.
They had him granted because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
For this reason, because of the inter-party argument of the Dutch Greens, there is basically no blame for it.
And Schulz isn't.
For the time being, comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democratically damaging, as Mrs Twesten places her own career interests on the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Bundestag faction, the editorial network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament on behalf of her person as a direct candidate, but on the list of countries of the Lower Saxony Greens, according to the Dutch MEP.
The logical consequence would be that she should return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, complains of a "undemocratic manoeuvre".
"The electoral will four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a leading candidate in the Bundestag election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the results of the elections," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there has been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Local core funding III
If you want to renovate your home over the years, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed about this development on Wednesday in Receiveden.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been refurbishments in receiving areas.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken two thirds of the funding.
In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to also promote internal development, and not only to open up new construction sites.
On 4 April, the President of the Government, Mr Karlsruhe, informed that there would be a refurbishment area III.
The funding total was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a refurbishment area created?
You will continue, Schindler says, to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in renovating interest in the planned area at all.
If necessary, the boundaries of the territory could then also be moved again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Sociale Stadt", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot, carried out.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The period for granting the aid has been running from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the survey would be carried out only once, within the framework of which the participants in the refurbishment area will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, as far as possible, the Statute Decision will take place so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to conduct the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
The aim is to assess urban maladministration and decide when and to what extent it will be rehabilitated.
A refurbishment note will then be entered in the land register for the respective land.
Pietzschmann himself will come again to receive and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that an essential success factor for the project was the participation of the parties involved.
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens by mail in the coming weeks and which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The Yellow Questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", in which it deals, among other things, with the structural state and the refurbishment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment arc", information can be made about the size, division and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "Operating Book" is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding functions according to the "wine dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding money for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make the participants a refurbishment "tasteful".
British inventor puts himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and index fingers and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through their company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built in both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000 according to the military's information left to the TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire fighter car and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on July 17th, around 7 a.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, due to the restriction of duty hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time with the aircraft.
From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Sounds like you're locked up," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health reform in progress in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government legislation.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But asking for their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February, when the Presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the Presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, deputy press secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to remove the US President in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesperson from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the hourly rates of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate.
"To set the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the refund rates estimates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to an RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract.
At this time, the former White House press spokesperson Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before a tricky task
The top rider of the Second Tennis League will join the table-ended Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the end of the table Searchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games, the top rider of the Second Tennis League still has the sense of reality.
In any case, team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I like the team very well."
For class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north mainly take place.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's gonna be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is in a practical position.
His debut for Blue-White could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Challenger tournament in Biella, which is currently active in Biella, does not make it to the Bundesliga party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in Liberec will be the first to be played in this season.
The undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball yesterday with the White Russe Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay fills up the cadre.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not seem truly happy when he signed on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his hast to legislate," the Congress had packed in a few "unconstitutional rules", he said.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the US advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV, who together with other European companies are worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Line Nord Stream 2, have been co-financed.
The Drohculisse is huge.
Nevertheless, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of an executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, Cali Cartel is put in the hotline of Netflix
Despite the second episode of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, Netflix's series is not over for a long time.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
led by four powerful sponsors, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city sets up 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban daycare centres.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (Kitas) again in its own right.
For Sonja Pomeranz, deputy director in the Youth Aid department, this is a good news: "We have all enjoyed ourselves very much".
Cooked outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked chilled.
The city operates in Krefeld area 46 day care centres, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing constantly.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat in the kita at noon," Pomeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2:00."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service starting from September 1st: they heat up the supplied food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, serve the meal individually, give out the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the length of the hour.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"They are thus much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the kita line."
This is also the case: healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team made sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known force in the kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm of improving the quality of the kitchen service, which it has proven to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-direction and foreign distribution for the city, says the Press Office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are readjusted.
"But these hours do not go so much into the weight of about 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the Council elections in the provinces. Three women run for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully turn power over from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on Kolpingstraße about 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl's cell phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without a prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure that managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie have a long-term commitment to production at their factory in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company had silenced on the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits in addition to other products.
McVite's owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the head of the company's branch, GMB Scotland McVitie's asked "Threat that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being pushed forward".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain any clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross from the general site manager concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force is highly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, rising cost of living and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie".
Pladis spokesperson said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continuous involvement of employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, during which some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we constantly review our business – and this applies to all our business sectors and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. Should our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up in her persecution of Neymar after she has offered £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogga returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the world’s most expensive player and the world’s highest paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president of this prospect?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players sign up, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prize offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately cast a scooter placed in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damage to the clothing of the vehicle of over 200 euros.
Police officer Schramberg, telephone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
In an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
The driver of a VW Touran had to avoid and touch the guideboard because he had a car on his lane.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum and his VW arrived from Stolzenau on the B 215 in the direction of Leesee.
In the area of the area surrounding Stolzenau, a car came to him on his lane, so he had to turn right.
The touran driver touched the guideboard.
Damage to property was caused by the car.
The driver of the arriving car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the polluter-car driver to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Paul-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral pamphlets continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German press agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be a great help to the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or at that time their false assessment of the proceedings.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticised the fact that the reporting of violence in the courts was measured with "two dimensions".
With regard to the abuses in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a matter of "disgraceful and shameful deeds" which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, it is striking that the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to regard it as normal," writes Scaraffia.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to the church and that's a found meal".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth "beats were a normal educational means" to "get rid of cheeky children as I was".
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on the abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memoir "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, appointed by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral pavilions were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedral pavilions.
The final report says of Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be said that Cathedral Master R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially with high emotionality, punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, contrary to many other accuseds, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even link positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why, in his opinion, the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves him.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on "The incident of violence in the use of protection warrants at the Regensburg Cathedral Palaces" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became hand-cuffed by the frequent when a domspatz didn't bring any musical top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages of the report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is found in it at all.
Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violence at the preschool also occurred outside his sphere of action.
At any rate, he may be accused of learning too late or of not taking first indications seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "Salvation", "Heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger exhibits an excellent witness, describes him as "hot-hearted", "popular", "genuine", "competent" and "comprehensive", as an extremely kind teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to outbursts of anger.
Not only did he bang with chairs and throw the keychain on the ground, but he also pulled eardrums and too naughty guys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it must be said that such methods of education were widely used in the years in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.
Do you still know such methods of breeding?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the violent excesses at preschool, these are, of course, debatable.
One wonders whether it does not have to do with his acquaintance and role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell upon him.
After all, many who have never understood him still work hard at the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburg Cathedral pamphlets in the context of the report.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also burdened with any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have trusted the cathedral chaplain.
Not even the parents were inaugurated.
"I've never had time to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the people concerned, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in the resolution of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir manager, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some way professionally.
How do the referees assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuses?
Michael Hesemann: One of the students asked put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and the perpetrator could have stopped.
I think it ... also really absurd to assume that he has... opened up more intrusive, clear or even more obvious than his parents, headmasters, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
The report thus comes to the clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and/or their environment were familiar to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is to be acquitted of every fellow believer.
Nor can it be accused of not preventing him or of having brought him to ad.
There is therefore no reason to associate his good name with these loathsome crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "violence" in the Regensburg Cathedral pamphlets.
The former cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger is proposed in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is another abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedral pavilions, between sexual abuse and violent excesses, as well as, we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the cathedral pavilions.
All the terrible plaguing pedagogy, the cases in which children of sadistic teachers were seriously harassed and maligned and suffered from them, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But there was nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys to see them when they were already at the Cathedral Patzengymnasium.
On this, as the most common witnesses emphasize, was the subject of "pre-school" taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisian" states.
What else was at the Cathedral Patzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
At most this remains the accusation of having looked away.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods in which the conditions at preschool were reported to him.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the past at a school where he was not active and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he points out that "in the preschool the beating penalty will continue to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when beatings were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that they happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us probably remembers.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned were perhaps exaggerating or dramatic and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that school beatings were officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time of the day.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fallstrick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards today.
The princess's right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was repugnant at all times, nor to what was committed in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond what was then common.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally being worked out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also adhered strictly to it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger give in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the issue of beatings also address the issue?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, and the cathedral pamphlets played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would probably not have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class from the previously nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don't make a big singer out of stubborn boys and stand before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-conquerion.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heart-friendly person, who cannot be imagined to do anything about a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former cathedral pamphlets still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read to him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral pavilions are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly - but he was also a kind person of respect, to whom they still look and worship today.
And please, once again quite clearly: all that is being proposed to him are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad we've been over this time for a long time.
But it is highly unfair to a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.
There the evil intention behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now it would be a good thing for a 93-year-old man who has earned great profits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany no one would ever know the Regensburg Cathedral pavilions, finally to leave in peace.
