Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth US President in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of over 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the North Road metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he makes a visit to the Nobel Institute where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organisations.
The Presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reached its climax with the ceremony in which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He receives this as the fourth US President, but only as the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when the prize is taken over.
The President does not wish to escape this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a President who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he strengthened his efforts by sending other troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete caritative work.
The event program then provides a banquet with the president and his wife, where, apart from Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant about the price from the beginning.
For example, he suggested that he felt that he did not quite deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was "call for action" for him.
Protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the Civil Society "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for extortion.
In several cases he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his vocations he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said Leitermeritz police officer, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and he's threatened with imprisonment for up to three years.
The sortier trash container in Brno does not smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sortier trash containers again on foot and step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to book a few minutes to find the appropriate trash bins.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even if we are the second-largest city in the Republic, the Council does not take sufficient care of this problem.
Brno is located in the waste stream in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting container, but above all because of the number of waste bins for such waste.
Have they ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a sandwich basket, for example?
This is art, before everyone, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found so far by chance is the killing spot in front of the hit goose.
Mr Unterka should not annoy us his colleagues, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also no honey in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends do not sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It is too far from them to the garbage bins.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street, I didn't see any paint bins in sight.
Luckily, I got to the right place while driving the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
That's still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more rubbish bins and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has deducted the money for pensions and health care
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials in spite of the government's view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, health care and construction business.
But also not for government interest rates or for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems to those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the Finance Minister, Eduard Janota.
When the social democrats and communists have enforced the salary increase for some groups, they reckoned that the government will additionally fund the money for the sensitive expenses, old age pensions or the health allowance. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, laying mines," says Janota.
Of the loans, there are increasingly higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money sometime.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or the costs of the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax should be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
For the pensions or the health allowance, from which the account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid they'll get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year will be missing not only 163 billion in the state fund, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Janota Minister, debt will increase more and more rapidly and, together with it, the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its regional deficit package.
Because of the downturn in support of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
These are mainly the sections obtained in the competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly be remunerated.
Get the most, which is also not free.
This means delay or cancellation of thirty large buildings, jeopardized is also the creation of Europe's money, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money in a salomonic manner - it attacks the CEZ assets, in which the State is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is distributed into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion from CEZ were spent on the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled and this money is also used as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 per cent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But the carnival of the revolutions does not yet end.
The budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or for expenses for court disputes, fell almost three billion, even for building savings.
Whether the state manages without this money is not certain.
It's pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister will then have to save money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two billion project "State Fund", which should allow to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be changing Android within seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that the American society wants to introduce VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware announced during an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern to the journalist with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now the company VMware is working with the European and American operators on the smartphone virtualization and the customers are going to come to the devices by 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Snowless slopes make trouble not only the giant mountain inhabitants.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order legally.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we believe this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on mash", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, pointed out.
Whoever wants the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate with the order.
Whoever prefers saving and where the quality of the stay comes second can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the New Year's Eve Day.
I think they'll try to sell them for a while, but then they'll have to give up, too, and go into a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura estimates.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still open.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Day in Giant Mountains the Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer, but there are less free places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year's interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne at 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already employed at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, certainly also the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains rises, led the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a bigger snow berry.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, Jiri Jakubsky was informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical with which discipleship Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question that he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it off about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that in the text itself he used the phrase "as in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path", without contemplating.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - sending fresh troops quotas in Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "irresponsible and in its subsequent Karastrophy decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and so far very successful that today's news about Iraq is no longer spoken at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, for objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the military quota, the military asked him again, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, severely criticized the sorcerers in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated on the general about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he himself originally calculated at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even despite the Brotherly War of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is influenced by the contraindication - no one can be relied on and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to changing their opinions every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only shady buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the intransigence of the conditions that complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences even further.
The establishment of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
The time horizon of the Obama strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
In this belief that the little soldiers who have broken into the cry of war about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date set for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is becoming disapproved.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions not affect the Iranians, a very difficult question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period when America steps to Obama to withdraw its victory from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation pad for Barack Obama is the fact that three more years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time left for him to embark on another strategy, and that would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonus bonuses in cash
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive any bonus bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be removed from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to the agency Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to link the Wall Street bonus bonus with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism, having set aside nearly $17 billion for bonus bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to the agency Reuters, the total amount of bonus bonuses in the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the start of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also being prepared by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm have taken over this year's Nobel Prizes from the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf has taken over this year's Nobel Prizes in the technical categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the chromozone field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israel's Ada Jonah, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for information on the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson have received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have taken this prize away for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these prize winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of purchase of the money price.
It amounts to ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prizewinners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversies of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the top of the country, which is leading two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is contemplating the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is reflecting on his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the government budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly of Members on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which further deepens the public finances crisis.
The president, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in his function on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party proposals for the roll-over of funds and increased the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct salaries of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it conceals increasing the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party on the other hand, there has been a sharp domestic-political dispute, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisherman Office Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSDD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures implemented by the fishermen's government in autumn and that, in their understanding, the government debt should end.
Klaus, who is able to sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, said today at the early stage of the debate with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem", which is the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances, for a longer time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS chairperson, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
In the editorial office, Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong statements".
The CSDD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek word that the budget deficit was cruel, that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
As early as Wednesday, the CSD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" in the world shows much of the country, whose struggle and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life the American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela to show him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon assumes another significant role.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'm gonna have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which to the end he became a slave-holder, a fictitious US president, and also God in "Evan All-powerful", but rarely anyone who still lives and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided according to Apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through the sport, so he decides to agree on the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team will rise to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was of course to speak as he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat dinner with him and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found out when I shook your hand, I took over your energy, it's going to be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you're feeling, he said.
For me, it's important to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, Captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I called the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the status of the actors compared to their actual role models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his analysis in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well-run film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret about Norway dissolved: The Russians tested a rocket
There was a special light effect on Norway of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket, called the type "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as about a "missing rocket".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but lights up
This already 13th attempt, at the beginning, went normal.
Technical damage to the rocket occurred only at the end of the flight.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" started out of the atom submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which was under the waters of the White Sea.
This rocket type allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over the north was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
The generality has stood up this time and claimed that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the accident was only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no test start without any error, the head of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atom heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself in a professional ice hockey game at age 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in distress, and is probably already taking off against Petersburg in Friday duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, led co-player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest professional Russian ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with fifty-one years and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001, he has been a member of the hockey star room.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime will be abolished
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Factory Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Because of frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed because two shifts would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of its employees for the proposed overtime.
Either you can pay the overtime supplement or you can take a spare vacation on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who ceased production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to abolish all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk stated.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work 2 overtime practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
The signing of the agreement will revoke the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions.
Further negotiations will take place on Friday afternoon between the management of the Automobile Factory and the trade unions.
The trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can sign some and a joint document to meet the demands, they are willing to cancel the strike.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation at the Automobilfabrik has intensified, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management opposed the fact that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
The trade unionists also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who had interrupted production on the last Wednesday in their Monday strike call.
In the field of overtime, trade unions are calling for a minimum reduction in overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice Automobile company Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
Series production was started in the company last November.
By this September around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects “steeled” HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants does not work as much as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot yet be cured.
However, the patient can prolong the medicine collection and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of viral multiplication results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, which are no longer effective.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and of the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metalocarborane have an effect on the protein substance responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block viral proliferation in ways other than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new 'improved' compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-ply cages, consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein substance of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would occur.
If we switch off HIV protease, we also disable the proliferation of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in the press report, published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease were tested in the test tube, also against their persistent (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used medicinal products, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its further properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes metalocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV medicinal products, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and of the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS started on fishermen, who fights
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the following year as "grayful" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It's supposed to be time for the analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSDD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is going to stay in office with the help of the left-wing parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, albeit with Linkparti’s proposals for amendments worth more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
In doing so, the government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that it conceals increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to manage with a residual of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less poor version of the budget.
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a senseless feeling, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to withdraw in case the amendments were accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota joined the Premier on Monday after the government business.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is its disappointment over the budget.
According to Necas, fishermen are in favour of further fighting with the budget deficit, so that the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD) who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to health benefits and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, highlighted Topolanek in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, there are people sitting in deputy function who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to abandon the fight against the level of public finances deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that they rely on the left majority, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be the case, then I will deal with it, the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, said to the journalists in Parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MEPs of the Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether, in the political debate on the budget, the ODS was not pushed back by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice would be missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the next few months everything would be positive, especially about the Bolshevism of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will terminate or limit some of the less-exploited express and local trains as from 13 December, while other links will be reinforced.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The fast train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less fast trains will also drive on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and to a few days a week the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to change.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end in the target station Prague - main train station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's regional rail bill: an increase of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall the railway will receive four billion crowns for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year,just like this year. The local trains will provide the districts, overall they will pay eight billion crowns for this next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive Czech crowns.
For the local trains as well as the fast trains, the railway has completed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for one year.
The rail system praises the system, perhaps because of this it has not taken advantage of the large majority of tickets to increase prices.
Changes only occur with one-day CD-Net tickets and with low-cost eLiska tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the rung, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This led the agency AFP, which initially only informed over 65 abductees.
All 17 children arrested were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 millionaires reportedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms division of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that called for revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the law was enforced because of the recent massacre in which 57 persons were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November, associated with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But those who resumed the peace negotiations with the Philippine Government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman a.k.a. Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be released into the American cinemas "Invictus: Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had been allegedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African Champion in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film's cinema, the reactions of critics and the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlah Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar Prize, then in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because he comes to the cinemas at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, preparations for the World Championship culminate, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are at first consistently positive, despite numerous reservations about occupying the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
I have cleared up this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I - as they say - can receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember the personality of Mandelas and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that has united the people portray the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial groups, separated from each other for years and days, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays his role in the South African National-Rugbydress on the World Cup field, which was won by South Africa at that time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may bring people together again to form a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves will only show up.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in recent interview for LN of the Rugby Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the Usti nad Labem District Fire Department, Lukas Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted the transformers to burn out, but later it changed the view, and now the fire is wiped out with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing substances.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short circuit.
No one was injured, according to the company spokesperson, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system did not endanger.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, and the damage will only be calculated more precisely after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, mistakes of this kind are rare, she added.
According to the spokesperson of CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted by the fire of the Trafostation, which did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as sole operator of the line system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into distribution system and line track with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura files criminal charges for slander against three leaders of the CSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today files criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, in which we only made the offer on the scale as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So there's nothing left for us but to resist us.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency Society, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation against the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges for the further continuation of the Jancura Media Show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that it will also become clear on this issue that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He said to the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas, and that he wants to continue after New Year.
He specified that he would run the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of regional rail transport by the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the contract in a high value of 150 billion kroner.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
According to Jancura, because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened by a member of the CSDD.
The only threat was if we do not refrain from losing our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said today Jancura to the Radio Journal.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
In vaccination against pneumococci, the usual changes from January.
It is to be the first free and voluntary for families.
However, votes already report that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that health insurance must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated against pneumococci for free, which was born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of vaccine.
Anyone who has already started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further revaccination.
The first dose must be given between the third and fifth months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 kroner and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance for the vaccine cans spend 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year.
However, they save on treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children's vaccinations.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear infection, but also severe infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill us in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, these are to be paid by the insurance companies and be voluntary.
For example, the head of the Nahlas Civil Society, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococci vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to enforce at least that.
I think that's the way we have to go now, led Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, you might think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary vaccination," says Cabrochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that it is the first area vaccination paid by health insurance companies and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money for prevention to save them for further treatment, Cabrochova says.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians involved in the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some MEPs, however, feared that insurance could "execute the money from health insurance".
Therefore the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This won't be easy, says Cabrochova.
U.S. artist son involved in museum theft
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken with a trailer at the invitation of 90 paintings in his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his representation of figures such as Conan the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an uncalled police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that according to a police oath Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means in order to bring all paintings into a camp".
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior was fighting for any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had had an opportunity "destroyed" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying the decisions until after the election.
The treasurer was also struck by the fact that he was targeting workers with low and medium incomes.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% capping limit on public wage accounts for 2011.
Social security benefits
The trade unions have protested, however, that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of forthcoming "problems".
The increase in social security - to about 3 billion pounds a year - has made the private sector angry, saying that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
SWITZERLAND OF THE PRESIDENCY REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year's economic downturn was more than expected by 4.75%
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of State pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds by 90 pounds per year will be poorer and someone with 40,000 pounds per year will be 190 pounds poorer, while one person with 10,000 pounds of annual income will be 110 pounds richer.
Ministers said that their deficit reduction target by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be borne by the 5 % of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the projected tax increases and spending stops were "a drop on the hot stone" compared with the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit reduction and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party predicts future economic growth, which will affect the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit settlement, was questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - much more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of the Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan, how they will repay it and press "Cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"You have said nothing important about what they will do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike the proposals of the Conservatives, which see the deficit reduction coming more quickly and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending stops is used to cover the expenses for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - like the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions in the next April - the treasurer would suspend the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance if people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only come about in the medium term.
The recognised Tax Investigation Institute said that the treasurer's figures would mean significant cuts in many areas, possibly in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his director Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, Economics Consultant at Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-edication report. The markets recognize this."
The FBI investigates "festivities of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they're also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are charged with and under what circumstances they are arrested," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authority was informed about the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US "must cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misuse" in Iran
According to a report by the Amnesty International Human Rights Organisation, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights balance.
Official offices said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands were sentenced to prison and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism on the part of the authorities, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of protesting against the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August in prison and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been detained with 75 other more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's reaction to it, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would have been unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a race track.
The ski slopes of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best works of art or tricks carried out on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam Be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on minarette construction and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies in Europe — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French do not love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and highly argumentative study of a dispute that shared and occupied the country over a decade and a half and its effects are still to be seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in this area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Spaces".
He's a good listener, he's giving back debates between teachers and students on the questions they're most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profanal matters, he claims, which make up daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognizes a new generation of Imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly in disagreement with their salafi counterparts – defenders of purist Sunni Islam, which is linked to Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of Church and State) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He indicates that Muslims may have experienced harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "enhancement of the screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Disturbed Outlook of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice she's marking melts at alarming speeds and takes life with her that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have recently entered the open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Embarked in the complicated history and politics of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the lake, who only fought with the butcher of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today zoo facilities still typically have a millionths of a wild old animal's life. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, construction continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sledge-driving Inuit use powerful storm guns to get their prey to the route.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneer irons of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries had for the first time the twisting of the packing ice.
Undersea boats, during the Cold War, assumed the shifting ridge during submersion.
A useful supplement are satellite surveys and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the arctic ice formed by salt-water canals that are pressed together during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marine infantry were among the 6,000 who went down in Arlington Kranze
The highman De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marine Infanters who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from wherever we are returned, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Peace Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Wreath company Worcester Wreath in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at Arlington Peace Court, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the National Cemetery of Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United-Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than 150,000 dollars on the purchase and transport of cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she had made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution that we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had as their goal older tombs from the 1st and 2nd World Wars and the Vietnam War, as they are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was happy, children played and couples held hands, while they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the icy air.
Some read aloud the names chiseled in stone, while others bent down to small black and white space cards, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son's tomb.
She was driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infraredry Subcommittee David Shane Spicer, who fell in July in battle.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been around for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, the US agencies for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US representation of interests in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on 5 December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of "risk".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who more often describes how they and their husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tension between the Communist government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasises that the United States will make a contribution when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year; they are now being used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to sign in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson at the U.S. interest agency in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any more information to arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
One activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, same Cuba", an allusion to the deployment of Raul Castro as a leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a allegedly leading conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help discover an extensive network of terrorists searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an untransparent insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had made YouTube's comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after arriving in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unprofitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US intelligence has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to accommodate human asset positions within Al-Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special test by A Kaida, said analysts.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have become much more cautious in recent years in terms of who they allow access to, because the U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand in Copenhagen Climate Action
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded that the negotiators at the Bella Congress Centre of the city act more boldly in the field of climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
One day, when little happened in the climate negotiations supported by the UN, thousands of activists wandered through the city with transparents, on which there was "there is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which said "The earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no more way around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosive bodies near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as beacons, but then followed by "some major explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of TV screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on the international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Test data show persistent race gap
The certificates of mathematics performance were welcome last week for good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far from the country's schools, producing the highest performances, the evidence shows that the fourth and eighth graders have made progress in the past two years faster than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African American and white students, at both local and national levels.
In the last two years, the average number of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their Afro-American counterparts only increased by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American octopuses remained basically the same, it fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white pupils was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black blocks in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown over this period, the difference has now narrowed by 58 points.
A number of district educationalists expressed their concern last week that the results that were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were, for the most part, promoted by white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, Executive Board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that is in charge of education equality in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of exam points is that the city's middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor pupils.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-Lese-System, which aims at pupils in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that comes to the fore from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelong experiences, was brought to Washington under the former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum will be attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of students who are below the level of grades, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide the additional money and resources for the disadvantaged schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhein, said Bruce Fuller, Professor of Education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban test results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could produce political repercussions that are working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that they are trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to make sure that we set up a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered to be "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than future prospects
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and flashes a moment when the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn appear.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was saved in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-members of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the lesson costs 38,690 dollars a year, was rather that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken the intended message fully: the question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the United States, who do not end the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college education, which is necessary to get up to the middle class.
In fact, one of five of this "second generation" of Hispanics completes the college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an indwelling drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts continue over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time either, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing these children with a supportive network from pre-school to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas College-Tour financed is a useful example.
It is known as the GEAR UP - a gear-up - and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the US Department of Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraq Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to reconstruct its damaged infrastructure at two auctions on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil indicate that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields separately.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that made a bid has reduced the number.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of the American oil mill at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asiatic and European provide the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were underlined by massively coordinated bombardments on Tuesday and political instability due to the US military's withdrawal, probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more closely in Iraq, which has the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and rather take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and who have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two major fields.
We all know, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to become one of the great economies of the world as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its co-operators and fulfil its obligations towards Iraq.
For the bidding, selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al-Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, a top action planer from Al Kaida was said to have been killed this week, according to representatives of the US counter-terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani government representatives of the region, were to have been killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the province of Northern Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret service from Miran Shah by phone.
Local residents who are suspected of being part of the militants ran into place and quickly took on everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism led to indeterminate evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of the Al-Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan.
He was involved in conspiracy all over the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of the US air raids on Pakistani soil.
Taking on its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Kaida's top leaders and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somalia had risen rapidly in the Al-Qaeda hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second representative of the authorities, but this certainly does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, as in a similar attack by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant party in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
Since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website entertained by a non-profit organization, the rate of attacks by the CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decrease can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, who have taken steps to reduce their attackability and at the same time brutally kill suspects, the site reported.
Leading UN Envoy in Kabul will resign
The UN leader in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, thus ending a stormy term of office that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The oath goes when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he was supporting the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. military plan for withdrawal, which is due to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to speed up the development of Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers to help in Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in military forces must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign his office, but only fulfilled an agreement with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UNO-
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he's better off looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban started the search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and considered the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously conducted UN peace operations.
The oath position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "probably harmed the mission, because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that UN leadership allow his successor to recruit more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN regulations have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in talks about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in Northern Iraq during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good options for elections, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
"One of the things that lies on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is unforeseeable to the war."
The Obama government is considering a sanctions package aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected by nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer from the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that it would resume discussions on the limitation of its nuclear programme and refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has forced this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, since that time Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community behind in respect of some proposals that they had already agreed to in early October, said openly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, brought together in a way that they had never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that the Foreign Minister once called Hillary Rodham Clinton "expressive sanctions".
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what they called on Thursday "the baseless and unsubstantiated claims" of some security council members to Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew into the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict in order to prevent delays in the U.S. plans from lowering the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
Change in the price of ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly started to change the course through the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "Not at all".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, provocative single children who are affectionately called "little emperors", a population crisis in the country is rising.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared with 6 when this policy came into force, the UN
Population issues are determined, while the number of population groups aged 60 and over is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent explosively, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people made up almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was under one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age had to have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of older people and to alleviate the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
It is likely that China's one-child policy, enshrined in the country's Constitution in 1978, is the most controversial of all that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed this policy to avoid the critical use of natural country resources, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural regions, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child.
Many couples also had sex - selective abortions carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high male-female relationship.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with whom a partner is a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is coming for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who had more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointment
Although officials from a small rural town in the outside areas of Shanghai said that an upswing in the applications of couples who, after the campaign, want a second child, the urban districts do not report any change.
For the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received each month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected in 2010 in the city will still be around 165.000 despite the campaign – slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to do their best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this was also legally permitted.
But they own, like many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance policy of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are deprived of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply a political one.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and do not really want to do this."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old, to whom a translation company belongs, said it unblemished.
For middle class parents with double careers, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns out to be successful and one must be selfish for that.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they don't want a life like this for themselves at all, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places enormous demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild his apartment" -- and life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UNO Group develops emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference – which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations – has once again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations shouldering the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that will take place as next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high should be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policy makers would bring.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, head of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put the focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, has called "the great whole".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement whereby the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the talks on Friday a boost through its assurances to provide over the next three years USD 3.6 billion a year to support poorer countries to adapt to the effects of climate change - from masters of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that had set the talks over the last week.
The American climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not financed by industrial nations.
This move announced that the Obama government is running a tougher line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without major emerging economies and taking action, so Star, who also complained that the text does not go far enough, ensures that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star issued its statement one hour after the Chinese Deputy Minister He Yafei declared that it was either "reasonable" to the leading American climate negotiator, or it was "very irresponsible" to him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake has led to the break-up of industrial nations, as well as industrial nations and emerging economies.
The current struggle also refers to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, where China and the United States were committed because of their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have resorted to more aggressive action in bringing the countries with very high greenhouse gas tax into account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who is also working as regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that are most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who is leading the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is "inflicting political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and are demanding measures from emerging markets, such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions had to be resolved before the Heads of Government arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, got away from their planes and rushed through the Bella Center's corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to intercept claims that are being negotiated during the next week.
The sheer extent of the assembly -- 13,000 people go into and out of the convention center every day, guitar-reproducing activists stage night shows where they make fun of the countries that they think they are betraying and selling, and drafts are handed over by hand instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Great Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the Monday feeling
On Monday morning at 5 p.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h in its lightning ride from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras, and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will finally connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuting cities, working hours would be radically reduced and the switch from aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, will report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass by urban areas and places where the environmental impact is controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also designed to create three options for a larger, north-facing high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route which would lead a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to complete the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today a little over an hour.
The drafts offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 metres of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 persons can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This, in turn, would mean that in London a final station would be necessary, on which 20,000 travellers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued in his view or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from high-speed trains to existing rail routes in the north of Birmingham, leaving the journey time between London and Scotland at more than three hours.
This is regarded as a decisive point of impact in order to ensure a change from the plane to the train, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Tax payers for mortgage for 75,000 pounds-orangerie of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he was able to build in his home in his constituency.
The prison spokesman of the party, who was demolished by David Cameron because he complains that house members must live "of lean rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to allow himself to build an oak factory plant on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The people in charge of the house approved the applications at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenses of the house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest house members, has a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control unit of the house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, during a recent study of his previous mortgage contracts, to comment on the increased take-up of money.
Last month, following an examination of its expenditure, the Committee acquitted it of the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over 271,406 pounds (€300,000) from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a member of parliament.
This week's published documents show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month by March last year as a mortgage interest refund.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was used to finance the raising of 75,000 pounds (85.000 euros).
The normal incremental RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that this May Duncan continued to assert its right to £1,250 (1,400) per month.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live "of lean ratios".
"In essence, working for the state means living by lean ratios and being treated as S*****e."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I claim a small part, measured by what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole fucking sum, but I don't do it."
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending, when it became clear that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before he had concluded with the Fairy Office that this could be considered "excessive demand".
As a protester in Duncan's lawn, an activist dug a hole in the form of a pound mark after it had become known that he had over three years demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros).
When he was questioned about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved both by the Fairy Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasiveness and gliding or a bending of the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all her faithful to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that stimulates spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the newest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free incandescent wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hat decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and director of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
As a church, why do we expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and lively place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturdays and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have arrested hundreds of people.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Change Conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what these demonstrations illustrate that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-disease policemen have intervened immediately and with no regard.
The police have announced that, according to your opinion, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, of these extremely violent splitters who have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has been arrested under the conditions of hundreds of militant supporters "without distinction", severely criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you "were still held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators have arrived with buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, have made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you have followed the call of Earth's friends to form blue tides for the "Climate Justice".
Today we are going on the streets to demand a restitution of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organisations.
European MEP José Bové, the shape of the globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there are no differences between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where there are many islands which are particularly at risk as a result of the warming, has given the start shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, about 50,000 people went on the streets.
In Manila there were several hundred people, mostly students who marched in red and honed Bandanas where you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators marched to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, denouncing Georgia that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia has elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to take part in the first elections after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist area that was recognized by Russia.
The polls closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling, according to the Abkhazi election commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced during the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian-secured total occupation, said his press spokesperson, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 26,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it had separated itself from Georgia during the conflict of 1992 - 1993, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to a polling room in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on the Bagapch on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, located in the east of the country, the Head of District, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the electoral process.
We, the Abkhazi people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised the agreements made with Moscow last year, as those in which Abkhazia left Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banca, claims to support neither the present government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Kopenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, arrested some 700 people, on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries until December 18th, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was built to welcome the scheduled speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protestors, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to strike discs, found a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unrest police officers have immediately circled you and have intervened carelessly by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitter groups that have already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury in the chin during incidents where, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We are in control of the extreme groups," said the police spokesperson Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the law forces were circling in the air.
Most demonstrators who arrived by train or by own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "Climate Justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the south," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say any more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that seal, there are streams that you can run through, which was never the case before."
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization opponents has approached environmental organisations.
The French MEP and critic for globalisation José Bové said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world today."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organizers, about 50,000 people went on the road.
In Manila, several hundred people, in the majority of students, dressed in red with Bandanas, made advertising in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Network of 350", several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycés.
National Minister of Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history are reinforced by the school reform of the Lycés, even if they are not compulsoryly taught in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours and the same program," says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome by this hypocrisy", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but a concentration "of the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. He underlined: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who have been indignant about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical Lyceen."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) criticise the state project of the deletion of compulsory education in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also objected to this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question regarding a limitation of the philosophy of the S Terminals programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for protest against the project for Tuesday, which they considered to be the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that at the beginning of the year, in Master 2 (M2), they are subject to a professional qualification test and at the end of the year an approval test examining their teaching skills.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year in front of the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach even more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "case which does not exist in the formation of the people."
He confirmed that he wanted to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the margins of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the pool of the school.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of films.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined in the hope that the audience may conclude that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online from 15 December on the school page.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the Trade Unions of Criminal Enforcement Officers called for a general day of action in order to ensure that the premiums and overtimes for which payment has been postponed for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before Christmas.
The 2nd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), called on the staff who do not have a service to demonstrate and block on Tuesday morning in front of the Penitentiary in order to draw attention to the "theft of what is right for them".
The 3rd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "to unite itself to make a strong mobilization in the various prisons", where the non-payment of overtime, night allowances and the Sunday and holiday supplements in December will be burned as a "disgraceful and unacceptable" market.
The first union of law enforcement officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilisations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penalty Agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime in 2009 has increased considerably and not all were foreseen in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep our criminal execution system functioning and modernising," said the Minister of Justice in this letter.
"I have ordered the management of the Penal Court to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen as a result of a lack of assessment of the overtime due, does not recur in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore marginal, except for management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budget constraints" have to be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille outraged and announced that "all assemblies and convocations" would be boycotted to new instructions.
"The staff do not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtimes," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks will be done to us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says the Bordeaux CGT Association.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, says the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he is giving Christmas ever better gifts than he himself gets.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has made out at the TV-Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is giving ever better gifts than he himself gets.
On a special show that was broadcast over the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year,” she nodded the president.
"So please," he smugly swore to her and pointed to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave it to you?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unenforced atmosphere with the well-known television moderator who supported Barack Obama so vehemently during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought with him for Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us for Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not until much later in my life did I understand that I had this ball from him."
First Lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday has been operating again, RTL confirms that he has been transferred to the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for considerable "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into the artificial coma in order to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors found "damage due to the operation of a disc attack", which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries required a new operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that one had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes that RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after his first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a disc attack.
The surgery planned for several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a subsequent infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the opinion to RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley". However, he assured himself that he needed "no worries" to make the rock musician, since this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was silly to get on a plane after such an operation for twelve hours," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer Jean-Claude Camus confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is suppressed".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he did not feel any particular concern about this.
Nevertheless, the singer’s health had become more and more concerned since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, in general, it was surprising that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer surgery", which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer started his long "Tour 66" tour as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the surrounding persons had to dement a return to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m positions of the gentlemen.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to take 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in swimming, 50m-free style, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec.. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet conquered the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane garments, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which started in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, twice the world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and the world record.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reach a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Tomb plate estimated at 1.5 million US dollars at Zola
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be US$1.5 million on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the third century after Christ and has always been rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architecture decoration, surrounded by satyres and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still in progress, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy versus the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record was in Rome for nearly 300 years at home in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she showed up piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Petain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "Emile Zola" heir, which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer compatible, after this leadership had rejected the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to indicate that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Patricia Espinosa, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs.
According to the immigration authority, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelayas, had returned to its origin.
The Putsch government wanted M. Zelaya to "repudiate" and ask him for political asylum abroad under the guidance of M. Zelaya.
The President-in-Office rejected this, however, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, official head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a further failure by moving me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not contain a request for asylum, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch government, explained to the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had responded in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would only make him president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of a departure M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president, who had opened up to the Brazilian Embassy and gathered around them, thus strengthening the military there.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, in his opinion, revealed the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, on the day of the popular survey organized by him to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on 21 September and had fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves this, he will be detained for high treason, for which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the Putsch government.
President Roberto Micheletti managed to organise a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term of office on January 27.
Wall Street in recovery, the trade balance of the USA nourishes optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high level of US trade balance figures reflecting a price recovery of the United States' shares and their partners: the Dow Jones added 0.67%, the Nasdaq increased by 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the stock exchange close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq again dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) on 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are mainly focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to 32.9 billion dollars.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a defitzuwach.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, the unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new jobseekers had "fallen to the low point of the year", said Scott Marcouller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3,482% compared to 3,432% on Tuesday evening, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4,492% on 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of guerrillas in power whistle "Damen in Weiss"
On Thursday, some hundreds of Cuban-power guerrillas plucked up the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, and also thwarted another rally, which resulted in the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were plucked out on the open road by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were at the foot of the march to the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "the road belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There are fidels and rauls!" the powerful partisans with raised fists scandalized the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place on the eve of Havana, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents were arrested by civilian police in the Vedado district, which also opened up for the demonstration held on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, and confirmed a reporter from the AFP.
According to this journalist, the dissidents built by the government, under force, have forced them to enter civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to just a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the Women in Weiss have organized an unapproved march for the purpose of "please release all political prisoners", whose number, according to the dissident list, has about 200 persons, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is incarcerated with a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 are sitting behind bars until now.
The Cuban authorities feel that the opponents of the regime are "merciful" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionary" reports.
Cuba, led by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of humiliating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy kills eighty years with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday, against late afternoon, a madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the initial information of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for unexplained cause in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported to have suffered the consequences of his injuries from an officer of the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital.
In the same pharmacy or in front of the same pharmacy, he tied up a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the tridents, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured in the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person hovers in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently affected vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and according to a police source, she has been hospitalized in a state of shock.
The armed man, who, according to police records, seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, should immediately be on the road, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: one thirty-and one forty-year-old, while the latter of the two heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivores, which he carried crossed behind his back, declared on site Arnaud Pressé, responsible for the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passersby, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witnesses reported by the AFP, to restrain the madman.
I saw a guy in the trident with a green vest.
Three young people tried to step in.
They couldn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stitches, so police information.
The event took place in one of the main battles of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of shops.
Passersby have come to me to inform me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first-aid position and noticed a claping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cuts.
The state police forces finally arrested the man who did not carry identity documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has commissioned the District Police Department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source doesn't rule out that he's being transferred to a nervous institution.
According to another police source, six police officers were stunned to arrest him at the Clichy Police Commission, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of exasperation" like "all the spiritual confusion of this kind, in which the forces set themselves free during the procession".
USA: Polanski's lawyer asks for a fresh stop to the prosecution
On Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States), the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly called for the prosecution of his clients, who are currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", challenged gross procedural error in 1977 before three judges of the appeal court in the second district of California.
I demand punishment on the spot, said M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of the judge Laurence, who was responsible for the case at the time of the trial, "let a cold run down his back".
According to him, the judge - now deceased - had a riding band before he fell down his judge, discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- what constitutes a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski: pursued and coveted), especially by the prosecuting prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "blogged".
If the Court of Justice refuses to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a process which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
The charge has, for its part, repeated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the alleged offences cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the US in 1978, even before the announcement of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then he has not travelled to the United States.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
If one wants to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accuseds, who is an escape option?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and therefore despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that "there were other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the suspension of the prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, again demanded the abolition of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by any resurgence of the affair Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September at the occasion of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, expecting a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and shuts down without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed off on Friday in a market that was broken down between better indicators than in the USA and a dollar increase: Dow Jones won 0.63%, whereas Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closure, Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Really, the market is quite quiet," Mace observed, viewing silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains very limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than foreseen, which "helped to improve the market view on the solidity of economic recovery", the analysts from Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumers' confidence improved significantly in December, reaching 73.4 compared to 65.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's indexes.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, pushing ''the sectors susceptible to the economic situation down', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something to the ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The return on the treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of tour through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the last hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected to the most beautiful woman in the world and this before a billion television viewers.
During this big beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already found their ticket to the semi-final.
Ms. Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were appointed Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a real strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were simply exceptional.
I have seen a lot of things and have had a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, and Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and were both Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it's the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the look here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional costumes and not to be forgotten, in the swim suit.
The performance is presented by a television host, the Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world with an almost overwhelming warmth and pride to receive, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted the bicycle and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the slogan in Cape Town (South West) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event a little more.
I'm wrong about people I'd probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Championship, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured him on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he left the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 o'clock CET).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital "fastest" and that Johnny Hallyday was delivered to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a disc incident on November 26th.
The singer was "moved this night in Los Angeles into an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, into which he was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation at night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the sick changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in Los Angeles's French high school on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer from the AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he had executed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said that they were completely upset, explained Mr. Camus.
I've heard of a possible trial being initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled to Los Angeles far too quickly and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I phoned this doctor personally, who assured me that he saw this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I already had two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist's environment.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, who operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been convicted of tax evasion and fraud many times because of failed operations and not to forget.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Chamber of Doctors, has described him as "a man without a shrapnel", who has to be "regularly" accountable to the board of directors and is "everything else as recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an explanation about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, on Friday.
This stated that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been raging since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), explained Mr Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and urges the party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
On Friday, the party alliance supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem party has reacted vigorously to a takeover attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre Party, Hervé Morin, and invited him to use this seal on no longer a document under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, believing that François Bayrou was not worthy to defend this political heritage after he had handed over his hand to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of the MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC) who claimed the ownership of the brand UDF, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrie".
However, the UDF party alliance, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be evicted and set a deadline for the Minister and the honourable Member, under threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and transfer the property rights of the brand to them.
In recent days you have made numerous declarations that you would propose to your political movement to accept the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and the Senator Jean Arthuis des centristisches Alliance.
You probably also believed you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF+ printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, explained the UDF's office and asked the party NC "to remove without delay the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette "required to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you in order to give respect to the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds us that Morin and his friends "have made the choice" to leave these 2007 to set up a competing movement, as had already been done in 2002 to set up the party "UMP".
The party Nouveau centre therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française), according to the signatories.
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF" but the UMP at the time he applied for the brand name for three years.
He profites in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of deposit of the acronym UDF to perform this for himself.
Furthermore, you should bear in mind that this recklessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for yourself instead of trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name that has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Beddencourt : François-Marie Banier is sentenced to use weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds in order to conceal part of her wealth.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to answer to court for the exploitation of weaknesses on 15 and 16 April 2010, a crime that is handed down with a maximum three-year imprisonment and a 375,000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter meet and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Chamber of Penalty also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Beddencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
L'Oréal's heir and principal shareholder has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by Nanterre's Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday are due to present a report before 10 March 2010 which will clearly tell you whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have found herself in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to investigate this.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs. Beddencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the hearing.
As for Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' attorney, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (banister) manipulated this old lady who needs to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to conceal donations of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Beddencourt had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer she considered to be a longtime friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
The lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt has called on three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she had betrayed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain to my daughter that for fifteen years, I wrote to Banier once or twice a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again considers that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because in recent days a guardian judge has refused its request to initiate legal protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Beddencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the Public Prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a judgment after the trial of the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best that it was previously on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the plant to impose.
By focusing the customer on the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides of France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "requires a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach from all the parties involved"; it claims from the employees a commitment that completely contradicts the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a corporate revolution, which would consist of placing employees in the middle of the company's concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very limited benefits of internal surveys
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire, which Orange has submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practices?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I could see that in the face of a new situation, the whole structure finally reached the point of doing what it has always done, after many detours.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
From major engineering schools, her interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neural sciences" and unwittingly widely spread by research institutes and the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) to involve employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos strengthens the leadership in a stance towards a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a corporate revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At present, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their business on the basis of a specified doxa that allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image of the company.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and reposition their human resource management.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
On Friday, American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on the eve and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the President’s speech this time, the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate at the 2008 elections following Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, said Palin, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily newspaper USA Today, and added that she herself spoke about the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in her just published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, attempted on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; one way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, pleased the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the "The Takeaway" radio show, felt that this speech was entirely historical.
The previous MEP, who is considered by some as a possible candidate for Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "could not be free and could not give a price for peace if the use of violence did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to being a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does," he "speaks like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a safety bubble that they did not create themselves and for their protection they do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "tired, high-end and uninspiring".
On the left hand side of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of the judiciary, you can easily justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderated left continues to praise the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, called the speech itself a "Monumental Work" for a speaker like him who is known for his talent.
The talk in Oslo "provides a timetable for managing international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the Californian daily.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Distance driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the threatening heavy supply pass for Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was opened on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated on the early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
Although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. was the agreement signed.
The conflict "had caused a great deal of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that he would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not very much, but we start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now required to stop blocking the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although "it was difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on a healthy human mind and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said about "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, in particular, to address the issue of 13th month salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the taxes on employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law on the adjusted finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "an identical" Senate vote.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies associated with this organisation and then to apply to the entire profession in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", says Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association launched a "fraud trade" because the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to dispel the goose-eating food on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement "shuts the small and medium-sized companies in the industry over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Problems at this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on RER A, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris metropolitan area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd strike day between the trade unions and the management of RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), kept the strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
At this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was only one of four trains ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to change.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big business in a technical way".
The RER A line passes through the Parisian conurbation area from the west to the east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains were scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the low time.
As already on Thursday, there was no human wave on the rails, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, especially because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), said he would have been extra "standing an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide care to travellers by officials and officers, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or went over Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, general meetings of the strikers again took place, during which the results that the associations had classified as "negligible" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for Line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
But that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is unable to solve a problem while this was possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting was planned for Monday's "comprehensive examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again it was the leader who refused any discussion during the strike until now, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand on the RER B line after the announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations are demanding a wage supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 are variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they are complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of passengers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage from 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a pay supplement from 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party of the country; a decision followed by the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government extremely difficult, which is trying to reach the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been taking place for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved as it has become a "place of activity which is detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision had been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including Ahmet Türk and Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, which Turkish and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the Party's property.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders stated before the ruling that parliamentarians would rather leave Parliament than meet as non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "wisdoms" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no connection to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court works between the Government, which is seeking to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the Kurds' rights in order to end the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a resumption of tensions in South-East Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP's premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is populated mainly by Kurds.
The officers used tear gas grenades and water jets when the demonstrators began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Turk assumed that the court's decision "will deepen despair even further".
"Turkey cannot clarify this question (Kurdish, ann. d. editorial) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party formed by the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo of democratic opening promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
"One can obviously look at a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow break can come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter shift manager of the FES.
Especially so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be this far for the first time in the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are available to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES proceeds according to an exact plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks are driven by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and pedestrian routes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in no more than three hours with wet salt, which is better bonded.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It'll be difficult if it snows at 7.30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not continue to snow, will there be access and development roads, including the Council-Beil-Straße, on the row.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, knows Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES get on their way, danger points and transitions are given priority.
In most cases, the FES could not take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in focus from 22 to 4.30 o’clock, says Brauburger.
As it gives on this fast smoothness, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the scatter on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-large animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickle curls and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the journal Science of Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in today's New Mexico, which was located at the equator in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories on Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually you will find only single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
After the current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared some 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these ur-dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debated when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, known as the "long necks", the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants eating Ornithischia (Vogelbeckensaurier), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, such as the descendants of the Theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America across all the continents, which were still a single land mass at that time as a supercontinent Pangaga.
The fact that the team together with Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot stem from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Palæontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be distorted because in South America just a lot of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant farm animals of the Middle Ages, it is still puzzling.
During the trias the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying auras and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relationship on the border between the trias and the Jura died out.
Success Story Did Not Last Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs happened to survive, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals helped to flower, which had also developed in the Trias and since then caused a shadow: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of University Toronto claim to be the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police settlement of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University beats waves all over the world.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, join forces with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapproved" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had let the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike be cleared last week because walls and works of art had been lubricated.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, judging the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The enclosure represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism is on "delegating and criminalizing the protest" and distracting from the contents.
The Bureau had withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers are calling for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation also join forces with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the University President and the police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in an actual hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU country MP Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext of criminalizing the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, one would have cleared up.
The Left has submitted a request calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the center of Moscow, is considered to be "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds had established contacts with the Frankfurter Wissenschaftssortort Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the companies of the Frankfurter Innovationszentrum (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed in Frankfurt a "Protocol on closer cooperation".
The Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for which Frankfurt signed planning secretary Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Science Focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to take a foothold on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to carry out orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill landscape, where the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bramklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
The project's advocates are simply "the new heart of Europe".
Just so. S21 is much more than laying down a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will overthrow the city of Baden-Württemberg’s state capital for a decade in unhealed construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born of the spirit of the 1980s.
Railway stations with rails ending in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils, which seemed like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, as it once took a great deal of time to convert locomotives from the back to the front.
Get in, stop for a while, go on - this is how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the Hauptbahnhofe should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is about halfway across the trans-European rail-magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unfeasible in the Hessian and Bavarian metropolitan cities to implement the lower landscape.
Head stations, however, also have no entry and exit problems since there are modern reverse trains with motor vehicles and vans at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction track to Ulm is now being considered.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project are borne by the Republic of the Taxpayers and not by the State Group.
The project can still be justified to some extent by urban construction.
New urban space is created, which - it is believed - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The main railway station and the extension of the line are designed for passenger transport, which - typically 80s - was attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost flyers.
Modern transport policy must first, however, be aimed at strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
However, because of steep gradients, the new line is not suitable for freight trains.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also tangles many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be banned in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing from other nodes and bottlenecks on the web.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometre stretch through the Rhine Valley.

Urgently, it would be necessary to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government Examines Judgment to Airport
The state government has left open at the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will review the decision of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flight.
The CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling examined legally, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing that, in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as provided for by the State Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is against the judgment under review.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Head of SPD Group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises for a night flight ban. Otherwise, this would be considered a "wordbreak".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, trying to get to her night flights with "Legal Twisting and Tricksery".
An exact legal examination takes time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, his group's statements on the no-night flight ban had never been.
US Banks Pay Aids Back
The crisis-stricken U.S. big banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp bank bailout fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (good 30 billion euros) at one time.
And the Citigroup is also planning to repay the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to remove the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had obtained some 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own checkout, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
Bank Manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had increased to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities towards the State.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, reported CNBC calling for circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their help.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Only two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the senior editor Nikolaus Brender out of office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the personnel.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was considered a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - official to prevent the proceeding.
However, it is also likely that this proposal should not have been dealt with by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 board members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender’s election was a severe defeat for Schächter, but one expected.
For the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election not to want to confirm Brender in office.
He had organized the resistance against the chief editor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that Brender had lost the ZDF's news transmissions on switching rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was shattered.
Last but not least, 35 state jurists had intervened in the debate, which considered the conduct of Koch to be unconstitutional.
It's no use.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 manager and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 Director of the ZDF Foreign Policy; since then Head of the ZDF Capital Studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the election of Brenders, who was elected journalist of the year from Media Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart to the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the Chairman's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck was also excluded from a selection of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's likely successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move of chess - by critically criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both creators without loss of face for the post of the editor-in-chief and to elect the board of directors, without suspecting that a party-goer would be transferred to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is in any case attributed to the left liberals.
Study Is Distracted
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the country's ministers of culture finally set in on Thursday: At a meeting of the Minister of Culture and Higher Education Rectors' Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions of Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single test.
In addition, the student's workload should be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of qualifications between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural specifications for Bachelor's and Master's programmes more flexible.
There should also be no different country regimes.
Fewer Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, cult ministers and university rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations: "Every module usually completes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper that aims to partially re-regulate the approval of courses.
With the "significant reduction of the test load", the Accreditation Council chairperson Reinhold Grimm said, "Failure development should be stopped, which significantly affected studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "necessary restrictions on the choice of students
".. "..
Students would have "a right to be given leeway, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules for the approval of new courses, but also for the review of existing ones, should apply.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this, all over Germany, which are subject to the Accreditation Council set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers for Culture had urged the countries to "emphasize" their influence on the agencies so that the substance content is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of higher education have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, universities are mainly to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen study counselling, audit and foreign offices.
Land and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a revision of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the design of the study more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's studies will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had once again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "after closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, the students should now also "speak with a little word" as an interested person.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermand: "We need the students' experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform paper.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it called for a legal claim to enable each graduate with a Bachelor's degree to gain access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, countries need to ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient Master's degree places with the best possible study conditions tomorrow, says GEW member of the board Andreas Keller.
Countries need to recruit significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and out of it is pretty almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who has gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literary Forum at Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
On Tuesday, during a meeting in Munich, he made a significant extraliterary appearance, which was about "Deutsche Literatur in Romania im Spiegel und Zerrspiegel der Securitateakten" (German Literature in Romania in the Mirror and the Mirror of Her Securitatacts).
Söllner is visibly dismayed and embarrassed by an explanation in which he stood before Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The application procedures had begun slying, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted intimidation attempts by the Securitate has not resisted enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Nearly at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that reveals the aberrations and despondency of a political system that is based on monitoring and spectralization.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge.
In his securitate act IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner the literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "swept him out" in all the difficious points for him at the time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is quite surprising.
Germany was a cozy reservation for Securitate-pitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected ones, one may assume, are speculated and in some cases have probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the very procedurally safe viewing of the Stasi stocks, the handling of the securitate surveillance remains very diffuse.
Systematic education has been lagging behind and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler authorities of the National Council for the Recast of the Securitate Act (CNSAS) was only established in 1999, but the issue of the files has since been rather slow.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great was an interview following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate-Chief from Temesvar reported on the winner.
She had a psychosis, eventually she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power here meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, raises unavoidable questions.
Why only now? Who has been harmed? The thoughtful response of the listeners to Söllner’s confession leaves hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if an adrett-dressed field servant had just come from a very nice Christmas celebration, on which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight to a famous C-class. ̈
The man with the distinctive glare was driven because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in play at all, and drunk before luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or go right ahead.
In the words of the Swiss who had been committed only three days before: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat in Mainz the king-class performance in the league everyday life.
And the already re-exposed weaknesses after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogregnyak (11.).
Expiration
The 8th Final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replays 9/10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy over the fulminant state of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only the supposed healer, who in the short time had brought confidence, commitment and joy to the uninsured Stuttgart professionals.
I went to the players and told them to think about their strengths, and stopped them from being braver, explained big soul clippers the simple-sounding recipe of success, which under therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He has triggered a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamic for weeks of injury, advanced to the best player in the square, tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new boss: "He is a man who grasps and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel there had obviously been a lack of it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs above all constanz.
Like Gross, players and managers guarded themselves against overrating the victory against a weakened and completely over-resistance of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 the evil awakening had come to mind Khedira.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was reached, the other was still in a distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was unable to celebrate for three months on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory, was due to the events of the weekend, which relived in the form of a television interview by Torschüter Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had shown a lack of leadership to the Board of Directors and had decided to change trainers on the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann also considered his day off after the game to be a sign of lack of sovereignty and favor.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure egoism," Heldt knelt back and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work done by the replaced coaching team, the playful and powerful idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Helt and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in heavyweight
Hitzige Duel in Bern: Time and again challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended its heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the Judges-in-Office of the Court of First Instance was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion, after version of the WBC Association, defeated U.S. Kevin Johnson on Saturday in Bern unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the K.o. everybody expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2,02-metre-large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly withdrew from the battles of the World Champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights into the goal decisively.
In total, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and only tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings met the world champion only rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had provided some vortex before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hatty zombie" who "can't do anything right".
When weighing, the champion was provoked to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose on Friday, "to see his eyes."
4th victory to Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of retirement, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "his" WBC belt, which he had to give up without a fight.
This year he won Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
In this fight I only got one hit and was physically very good in shape, Klitschko had founded the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the WBA belt is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to untie Nikolai Waluyev's 2,13-metre-large in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a September scheduled fight against Vitali Klitschko.
It is said that his doctoral society is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the Wembley Stadium in London.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Minister of Defence Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the air raid by Kunduz, the opposition Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has subjected a deliberate deception.
The minister said on the deadly bombardment on two tanker trains in September "knowingly the untruth," said Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news show "Dagesschau".
It's called the nationwide: he lied.
The order for killing had been issued in violation of the rules of the International Guard Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted vices, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) asked Green, SPD and Left to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghanistan policy - and whether Chancellor, Federal Armed Forces and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Grünen-Kollegin Renate called for Künast.
Government spokesperson Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office did not influence concrete efforts by the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation of the ministry had also become loud about the backgrounds of the resignation of General Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the background of the two top officials, it was claimed that they had even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document by the commanding colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the matter in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Generaler Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which intends to establish itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in awake condition and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mental ills and drug rushes, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it's in the sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhinderedly give in to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike conditions in their growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicts in the modern Western world, at least as special ones.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the case of mental illness or in the case of drug abuse.
Blame has our imagination: The same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint images or write novels sometimes ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality are blurred.
Dream-changed alertness states can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of brain neuronal messengers - first and foremost dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the wake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 observed a "great resemblance of error with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the incompetences, delusions, and innuendos of such.
It's autumn 2001, when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and soft-smooth.
Gravity has no more power over him, it floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a step.
Behind him winged devillike shapes with bloodred, distorted frets, flaking teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, evil voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, knots them to a sling and attaches them to a hook at the ceiling.
He climbs on a speaker and lays the slings around his neck.
Jumped.
The sling is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, yelling at the voices in drum-fearing choir, "Go to the clinic and get yourself healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he is taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life, and is treated as the second most common post-depressant disease in psychiatric clinics.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the interior and the outside world, they get into an exaggerated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic in Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is in the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time he becomes in a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible to them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, says Fuchs, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in real life.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
Emergency situations can lead to a short-term loss of reality in every human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not alone determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery about the interference of the neural system, which also does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether fake images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of position.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and false stories for ten years. Last year he evaluated his results in the book "The Irreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical manifestations of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
These include, in addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and skull brain traumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to box, consist of memory contents that are normally withheld.
They are created when the cerebral organs in which sensory perceptions are processed are over-active or under-hidden; if our brain is running hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritating, stress, love-squatter or other mental conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in life.
In summer 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break it may happen that a slender boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
If he answers, the students look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next door.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? sometimes she asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly frightening
Often, the images of deception are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher just introduces a new fellow student in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else at the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and much too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or is dreaming, whether the pictures she sees arise, the frogs or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them about what they think is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist's box on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Mad is also a work of art out of despair
When a person is socially isolated or suffers from friction, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suppose the brain is then underemployed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Papa, since she can think, is not her physical father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and sounds, people like Sarah K. find it hard to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is happening in the brain, the reality is occurring there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear so real."
Nightly dream images also value box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mental health is able to recognize their delusions as being unreal.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to value the hallucinations also as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, imaginary experience is usually pathologicalized in our too much-conscious world," says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative – madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of dream-changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experienced person thinks are real and which he cannot in retrospect distinguish from the state of alertness.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or illness-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of instigation and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which allows people to make their own design ability not to fall into a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his one-iroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a salvation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when, after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplantation, his consciousness travels for days, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness at the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Swallowed by a Greek on the motorcycle in his home country, surf with his hospital bed in the pine snow of the Alps and meet a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from every dream.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of outer reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist's box, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can be quite enriching.
The snow break can come
Burda
Children are to take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new publishing director Kallen is an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his business to his two children in the long run, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long run.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said to the SPIEGEL.
We have regulated the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to frame 7,500 employees if they are not adequately qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors starting in January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with Treasury, responsibility for the company's assets and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left, came the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign exchange, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who is 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also served to bridge "10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickeddanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe before the downfall: "This always involved families who were infected by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never world dreams," says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to be part of the World League with 'Time', these shops have grown too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is on the eighth floor, you will find renowned companies such as Hedonai, which provide a laser depilation; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your feet with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training units correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretch exercises) are enough to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained your body, still want to look past the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments to regain the hair glory, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that's why it's a good opportunity to copy the stars' appearance and get their clothes in our wardrobe.
The form of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. You can only advise on this.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed in order to promote the electric car and to summarise opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric Cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
In presenting the economic report for 2009 by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures that the government has taken to support the automotive sector during the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would today have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," said the government president.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue producing in Spain in a highly competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the benefit of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to stimulate demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which will be applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows an average reduction of 6% in emissions from new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals which increased by "40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally sound sport
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and stop system of the engine, named i-Stop, a device which is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of Mazda's 3 produces good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
In addition, the steering wheel game is excellent.
Looking further at the unit consisting of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is located on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of the German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger dream of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can drive by car in an extraordinarily comfortable way.
All this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and stop system is currently only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its fineness, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don't travel many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort at the gearshift and its low consumption, even though the diesel models are the most sold at Mazda.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test ride is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the series equipment.
In particular, the RVM, which removes the dead angle, also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the large-screen computer, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-bluetooth as well as the chromed 17-inch rims, emerges from the serial equipment.
In addition, this version also includes, as if this were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to additional elements, especially the learningable bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD-ROM.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not spend many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which lies between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the test-tested Sportive model.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest pass.
A premiere with lots of glamour
L. A. unrolls the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, were more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "pee", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read his e-mails, without any possibility of seeing or surfing certain attachments through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine to become one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is, however, especially for young people of interest.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company has launched two new devices: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented at the event Le Web yesterday, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise set.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to dispense with all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the border or if you are desperate for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored.
Outside your own country, you're always afraid to read his emails and that's right.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer these types of tariffs means that phone providers have to slowly but safely rethink and start to consider different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, and its prices include downloading books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without a referendum and without a hook.
This is an Internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, i.e. when you buy it, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase opportunity with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails by phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama became president of the United States she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his life, no doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models on both occasions: even more that it was almost the same color - a shiny greenish yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and she wore a little large embroidered or necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo of a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and for the second time an obscene model, but gold colours.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was stuck on this occasion as a hairline, while the previous hair was open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women on fertility and careers of women in Spain.
The survey among 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years of age leaves no doubt: 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities on the labour market restricted because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to set up a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what type of occupation they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed contract of employment, become more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women are moving with a firm position, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and maternity, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women of the age group aged 35 to 49 with a fixed employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after the date of the contraction, a figure which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have needed longer periods of time to achieve this and who have only achieved their contraction and the first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of willingness to receive it," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only had primary or higher education, were on average mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women get married with a main degree before their first permanent position and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree are looking for a permanent position and then marry and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
As of next year, the German actress will be the image of various brand products and will also say the well-known advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous sign as well as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the case of men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (a playmate of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they were all published.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker Game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the three-dimensional x-ray pictures of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work) but seeks an agreement to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent saves neither terror nor enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I always felt, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unwholesome fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with an imposing poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was put in a trap by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which, because of the adultery, the emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in getting into heaven on the demise of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in worldwide literature, one has to climb up the north wall, on the wall where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cow.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and another time he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the crazy scream that was screamed out of a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo was heard in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. He did this on a journey where he fled from himself and begged the afterlife with a speech of violence from the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a full life one finds delight in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying on her between the azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man showed so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was still much larger than their madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, that he might put himself on this podium?"
Figurative Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our part of town last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed by her and our dog, our dog is a mixed-up we got out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then out of the hotter sky they missed him two steps and severely hurt him with it.
Our dismay cannot be put into words, as it is incomprehensible to us, since the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was, of course, carried out on the leash.
In addition to this, the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, for if such a madman attacks a dog, he might also do the same with a woman, a child, an older lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o'clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have reported in a nearby police station, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowards were Spaniards.
Our dismay at the incident has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what these young people have to do in their minds, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative seeks to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "contains far more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more secure with each day" and further reaffirmed that it also contributed to bringing this goal closer every day with other actions of educational and informational character.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and especially for the reason that as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles it is always committed to one of its main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks increases slightly again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally starts to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in relation to the year 2008, and, much more importantly, they are thus the first growth ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac and Ganvam Association of Manufacturers.
However, these good figures are currently only to be taken with great caution, as the reference data used for the comparison are November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% in relation to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles made up of the small transport market are included: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter small trucks/vehicles.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunder are still in the sky, which are the most pitiful in demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, one has to add to these limitations, which are the result of the bank's inflow of funds, other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the duration of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support has not helped much in the purchase of a 2000E vehicle.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy a small carrier up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 exhaust that may not exceed 160 grams per km driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the State to also pay special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (lorry cars and buses).
The Autoretailer Association prophesied a similar year for 2010 as it had just passed, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS at the time and as with the stability control ESP at the moment, the auxiliary braking systems must become mandatory in European cars in case of an emergency.
In fact, they are already required for all newly registered passenger cars and light small carriers, for which the remaining vehicles have been set a standstill period by the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many road accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre, which detects the system on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake strength applied by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident were no longer able to hit the brake pedal before the crash, and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
By contrast, the braking aid intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance travelled by a car during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even less accidents - one expects that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel to January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were already informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
After all, Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants the page concerned to give its consent to each single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining ever stronger support.
Should none of these buyers come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to really make it 80 kilos easier, bringing only 1,275 kilos to the scales now.
In order to create such a thing, they forcibly avoided the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a screened roof with manual drive, so that alone they saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; moreover, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, thus saving another 7 kilos; by installing another 12 Bacquet seats and saving five again with the light 19-inch rims.
Then one had also achieved another six kilos less by renouncing the audio system CDR-30 and by replacing the door handles by handles made of fabric the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the double coupling gear PDK, the test drive was performed with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In his driving behavior, he can only be given the note perfectly.
However, the reduction in its weight has not led to the fact that it would no longer be on the road so safe.
It is rather the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not had such a small and light model tested, but at the same time there is also a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low passage in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, slow down, recover and then again to get everything out of his engine ...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we can to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the boxster S) has been very successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at the Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration capacity is unimaginably brutal, regardless of whether standing out or speeding up again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car mastered the keyholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do throughout the course; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the morning grey and rolling split in the morning.
In summary, one can say that it is an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable passport, as it is probably rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 Euro.
Behind Girl'
The singer, a bustling friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her Chanel pockets.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent 82-91 triumph on his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight triples the best of his team (29 when rated).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of work and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue-reds, who sat at the top of the ad board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already possible to imagine that they had come on the field with well heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that on their field not everyone wins, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but everything but dead, had to prepare a few matches with certainty to get air again and one of them suddenly came up with Mirza Teletovic's pistol, which, with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas, made sure that on the ad board the restful distance of (54-67) was displayed, which the host could embellish with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
In the last quarter, the Alavesen were blossomed, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team did not and tried to give up their team again by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was put off due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign the leadership of Group B of the Euroliga to him, and this was marked by the failure of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) players, especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Málaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter play, the Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts dazzled with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, even though the local team with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, it managed to show the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which it had come almost to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to get warm at last and its superiority on both sides of the game, while leaving the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-provoked mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces of Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian forerunner Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympics team, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to compensate for the difference in the Málaga game with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the exodus of Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympics, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, were not to slow down.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to resign the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn in Facebook based on his profile?
The users of Facebook can now, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, learn their salary which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users on the basis of more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users are provided with a form in Facebook that allows them to enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Even after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found out that the Spanish worker feels on average "badly paid", explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day workers and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date of departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic representation no later than 27 January 2010 when his term of office expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message he had found since September 21st.
"He is aware that he will have to leave on January 27th, as his mandate will expire on that day and he will have to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the scheduled date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the elections on November 29 (at which Porfirio Lobo was the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to find refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, because of Zelayas' refusal to recognise the status of an asylum seeker who wanted to force the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most seductive days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate for the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to leave the liquidity indirectly free of interest, which is around zero, so that banks buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of Assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, begin to scatter some sand into the gears, as the BCE was already doing next week with its annual auction.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are going to witness a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to take private risks and government debt is rising again.
The focus is now again on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in relation to Germany.
Spain has not yet been affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for global economic policy, for what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects of limiting loans to job losses when they should have decided a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs in order to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also anticipated in the past.
A government that conceals the sovereign debt, elections and a new government that draws on the same strand.
Prodi made it to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso in Italy.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to stop fulfilling its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account in the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some staggering on too high amounts, would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators here force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which therefore come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this does not promise longevity despite warnings.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is called "cautious driving".
Associated branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, when the strategy on the energy supply of Spain was debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some clues as to what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from that date by 2030, provided that current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this were not the case, the investment needed would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but rather in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not in any case want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "it is clearly set out in this direction in the long term, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola said.
Be it as it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should already be made, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swiss sports, is the preferred partner of Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for luggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, is set up for five years.
On the other hand, yesterday Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to examine energy efficiency at motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German high-depth are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The City Council wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the administration decided to establish a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) in order to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll station management.
Expecting the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best civil engineering specialists.
Against the team of Acciona, the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower elections, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises to overcome massive construction work and privatisation, however, has a hurdle to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the companies called Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only through its 30% participation in high-depth, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona attaches great importance to this geographical area for the sector in which it is already well known because of its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Under other assets it already has its large wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll line, which will be supported by the City of Brisbane Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link (North Zubringer), is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the main measure of congestion reduction on Brisbane’s streets.
The schedule issued by the City Administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll line is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that construction will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million) in financing.
For high depth Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia continues to award substantial contracts to high-level, which signed a contract with the government yesterday amounting to 154 million.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create rapid Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received a high depth of 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired over its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take more than 32 months.
Sri. Rushmore receives advertising of Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sri. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
This contract also includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sri. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that presented themselves to this competition announced by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sri. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of the slowdown in competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty of over EUR 63 million on France for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to it.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in landline and mobile telephony through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in penalties since 1994 because of the handicap of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority that is watching over the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar crimes in the past and has therefore become relapsing again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened up an application page to increase revenue from non-telephone business.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has contributed Madrid and Barça 476.4 million from the beginning.
Since its birth in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of the UEFA brings not only fame with it. It is also one of the main sources of revenue of the big clubs.
According to the UEFA, the league has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) participating in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located in third place in Europe, which has earned the most money through its participation and the only one that has won the trophy three times next to the AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is the fifth.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League.
And this, though they have lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to raise money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, in contrast to four bee Italy, three with England and two with Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated method of money distribution used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini expects to receive a revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who competed gained 3.8 million due to their bloated presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they fought.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for an undecided (400.000 euros per team). Clubs that have come into the eighth final will receive three million each; the four that have come into the quarter final will receive 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who earns 5.2 million.
So a football club gets at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen, are added.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group made sure of details about the purchase offer of shares by which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares closed with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 Euro reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives shareholders a period of 15 days to inform them of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come into contact with the Authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible sales offers and the judicial questions of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of the internal book review.
A decision that makes her the first woman to have a high position in the food business.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the leadership of the group.
This is all but free from polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle for the suspicion of redirection of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
Yesterday, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had authorized the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Patermina's public exclusion invitation to tender submitted by the investment firm Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been shown that the conditions of the law are complied with and can therefore be considered as "sufficient" in the content of the explanatory note submitted, following the amendments of last 2 December.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Patermina at the price of 7.65 Euro per share, which in turn is 8.95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 Euro in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the invitation to tender and whose price has been determined by Federico Patermina in accordance with the laws of law.
New Vehicle Review Programmes
In these days of storms and accidents not only do the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops where an assessor has to assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
No accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest information technology tools, it is a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the assessors use this kind of system.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process them afterwards and to offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be processed is becoming increasingly large, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been on the market than in the last fifteen years.
As soon as a new car enters the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, for each of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolated and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is speedy.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road-traffic vehicle fleet, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each one of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
With the transparency of the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the assessors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times or paint prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It is most expensive for customers who rarely use it at most ten times a month, namely 5.75 Euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, using the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which you can offer vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or in obtaining information on the variations by brand and model.
For example, one can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to be involved in the workshop due to boilers or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images of the same kind, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Eina Group company founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for assessing vehicle damage, breakdowns and maintenance.
The GT expert leader is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3.100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the sources of the company, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total turnover in the world of the group Solera (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
The company has revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auctioning accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a flat on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase next year to the remaining 15%.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value-added, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to professionals such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap shops and car dealers who need to be registered prior to their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been registered may no longer be driven on the roads, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars with historical value may be re-authorised, even if they have been de-registered after difficult authorities.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The ease of handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required replacement part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts and thereafter can have the cost estimate printed out and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented work does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, as you can choose a door with it for example and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
