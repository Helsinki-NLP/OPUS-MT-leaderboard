Father woe, you some are in the heavens! Blessed be the name of a man; if the kingdom come, let some be in heaven like this on earth; let us give thanks to the day of our daily change; and let us give thanks to our debts, so as to give some meaning to our debtors; and let us not suffer temptations; but let us save yokes from ten evil. For if many times a man commits errors of his own, then the heavenly Father will strengthen his strength; but for the sake of not many monsters, the Father doesn't approve but gives birth to errors of his own.
You know, keep the cap of our loyalty between us, please.
