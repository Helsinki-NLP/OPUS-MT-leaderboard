According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police arrested 20-year-olds after quick motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after observing how it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before deflecting into the bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who corresponded to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of ignoring a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, asleep, and could not signal any consent."
Webster is also accused of having raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highlands on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Reconciliation with the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus Congress.
That is why I proudly introduce the Staff Authorization Act together with the citizens' icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops non-profit-making forces.
Complementing the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representation in order to sue a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation for damages or penalty payments - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and uphold labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocratic Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the workers' rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognising the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, which designed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or accede to trade unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to create a union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After these rights have been violated in America, it is indeed very wise to re-examine the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and has raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that have made America great in the past and that have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana may force closure
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was introduced in June by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, and is due to enter into force on Sept 1, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a right of patient admission at a hospital within a 30-mile radius in order to obtain their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors may provisionally continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be organised for the judge to establish a more permanent decision for the law.
Abuse supporters welcomed the decision recently taken in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would take more time to obtain hospital detention rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana escape from a devious law that wants to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the proceedings and had also applied for the right of detention.
Louisiana is one of 11 states which have passed similar laws, while courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that had forced most of the hospitals remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
The American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that the admission rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Opposers oppose measures to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of hospital closure.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient rights, notified the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop carrying out abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery because of fear of his safety, said the group.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for carrying out abortions, while their applications for patient rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted an online video hommage for their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where ovarian cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDIES: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years of age.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those with cancer at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death was 20 percent higher during the study than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centers than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to combat distances, it proposed, as a possible remedy, strengthening the service of infused doctors in order to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of age, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling house owners' numbers
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years could result in garden centers losing tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers, according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age group for garden products".
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount spent by people with their own homes on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting courtyards for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion per year are sold.
In the Greater London area, where over a period of 6 years the proportion of homeowners fell from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot move plants.
Guy Barter, head garden consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail trade due to increasing domestic wealth and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the priest Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have been bombarded by the state television station PTV.
Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters back out of PTV buildings.
The transmitter stopped its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now transmitting again.
At the same time, around 3000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they supplied themselves with sticks and stones equipped with collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused.
The country's army therefore urges a political solution to the conflict to "squander without time and apply without violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has been brushing more frequently.
The opposition politician, Imran Khan, accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the country's most senior U.S. diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said that the US Ambassador and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major field of activity for US and British intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also included the most important secret service in Ankara in Germany provided for a much worse response from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Lokführer threatens with consequences for commuter
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive guides on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The delay announced for 18 to 21 hours covered all transport companies throughout the country, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the trade union German locomotive leader (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Head of Police of Magaluf of Corruption Charged
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of extortion by policemen and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the Calvià police on the Mallorcan holiday island was arrested for corruption by businessmen and barbers in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after accusations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily Majorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of Calvià City on Friday to the Office of the Prosecutor of Majorca's Anti-corruption Office.
Two more local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the accusations of corruption and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish national daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said that the government’s vetting business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our livelihood out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed on 24 men during a sweep tour of Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-drinked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage had to pay a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
THE FREHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 2 p.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already sung in the night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a gun that started just before 8 p.m. and provided almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time, wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off on a second approach and finally set up at about 8.40.
The delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quanta flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies means: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switchboards, our columnist Bernd Matthias comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone falls, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind this: if the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around in the house in no time at all, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, it is true in the echeltronic.
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And for example, anyone who has another tube TV in the living room today simply says that he refuses TV in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because ifa's appeal at the radio tower this week again brings to our attention our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
Today, the layman, who once ruled the washing machine and CD player blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread in front of him with unfathomably noble expert speech: "Connected Home, wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, you all right?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
In fact, for some 20 years it has been primarily because we like to network our house.
In order for the yogurt to reorder itself, so that the fire detector can tell us on holiday in the Maldives that it burns in the study room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we went from the office to the air conditioning on our early arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon come true: We lift our watch, say loudly, "Sweep!", and at home the vacuum cleaner will go.
Irre.
Everything is running on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred", is a true industry knower, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza still needs in the oven, which is not useful because we are standing in the reservoir.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-mode device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to the schools on Monday after spending the summer in air-rescue rooms, while rocket and mortar fires on their communities settled during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel drawn by rocket holes, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students grenade splinters from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a native of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a bit funny" to go back to school all of a sudden.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of border communities like Seed stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitated to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily characterised by Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Last Tuesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for Hamas to be disarmed and for the surrender of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests this information and estimates that it is at least half of the killed fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fights, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be open again so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the loss of the votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Fundesvize Thomas Strobl has voted for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvisze Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also head of the CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a gratifying development in the right direction and a development that makes me more aware of the fact that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed in the vote on Sunday just under five percent.
A first attempt at a ban on the right-wing extreme party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at that time had informants in the NPD.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not join in.
Harburg: tents for new refugees
Refugees are now accommodated in tents at Neuländer Platz.
The central first shot for refugees in Harburg bursts out of all seams.
Now the Interior has placed three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were only briefed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further provide citizens with reservations and do not allow district politicians to play a constructive role in the humane housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Green Group in the Harburg District Assembly.
Its party calls for the Harburg District Administration to provide houses that are currently unused for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial take-up are the storm of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a far-sighted index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data of Monday.
As a result of this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's head of research, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-way market.
RP Data's figures show that house prices in Sydney rose by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government expenditure and where prices rose by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in the real estate for sale, which would be subject to "a real test" for the next few months.
"If one considers the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press he contradicts statements made by the Managing Director Peer Medau and certifies him to pose "like a field lord".
This is not the style of the university, the communication states.
The Medau family had already "been informed orally about the institution's attachment in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were not known until July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "definitions or even decisions", but there are "preferencings".
The extension of the narrow road to the castle necessary for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was about a nine-metre-wide street and is not the talk.
According to the current state, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schooly parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future is not to allow Pötzl to apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because, as with other public parking spaces, it can now be intelligently solved.
Thinking About the Residents
According to the university president, the children's cribs, which are located on the grounds and which would lead to the entrance to the park deck, should not be "impaired".
Rather, he is concerned about "that this is not only about the children's children, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
It is therefore much more than about the particular interests of the Medau gentlemen," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the pediatrics, with the extension of the street, would be justified by a "the few natural spots of Coburg" "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Staatliche Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the pediatrics about the plans of the university.
This means that the entrance to the new park deck should not lead via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, as before, but via the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be extended two-track on about a mile in length.
According to Medau's high bills, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles per day are mentioned.
On the part of the city, they did not want to comment on the project so far.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Federalligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy, it was mature for several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," said the 2007 World Champion on his Facebook page.
He thus retires with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his cadre for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have impressed me just as much as they will inspire my longtime co-players and my successors.
But for my club I also want to be available healthy in the next few years, for that, longer regeneration breaks are needed that do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achillessen's problems, he had been treated with a cortisone syringe by team doctors from the German Handball Federation (DHB), who later caused a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers don't pass any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 at short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
To this end, some other wear-related complaints arise.
As early as the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, my body cannot deceive," said Glandorf in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be available for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings are torn, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble as to my health.
After my career I would like to be able to go at least a bit straight.
In 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) he won the EHF Cup.
In 2012, he won the European Cup with Flensburg.
German economy fell by 0.2 percent in the spring
The crises surrounding the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was communicated by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8 per cent over the second half of 2013 was achieved in the first half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
On Sunday, the town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "feet riders".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is about the largest cycle tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various specialist magazines.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to participate in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were pleased about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the association home of the Schützenbrederschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which had been prescribed for three different categories, went back to Horstmar along the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havoxbeck and Bilderbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor's deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all involved.
The organisation went without any problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing drew a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in hopefully beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend", but the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Weckers unrelentingly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songmaker, pacifist, political-proof activist, ex-Häftling, in "Mönch und Krieger" has brought to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thought fetishes, the Municher, born on 1 June 1947, wrote down his memoirs, initiated each chapter by a suitable song text.
And he is ruthlessly honest about this: From masturbation as a gymnast to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also takes on abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social critique, his political commitment - and also how not only has he influenced music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician) but also his prison stay.
The latter also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the Ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary".
There are also short anecdotes on earth between all the high-spirited views: for example, over bats in a localized by GI's or a crazy car ride where he directed a tree at the frontal.
Even there, he is unrelentingly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never put me in his arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is trying for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is contemplative about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just stopped his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's time, he gained an insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, odorous, deep stylus labyrinths with flames and smoke and lots of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, how he started to sing, because he could wash the foundry from himself.
As I was walking around there, I realized that for years he had done this to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew stronger.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without parental love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
It wasn't until my mother went bad toward the end of her life that we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theater.
It was followed by The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comedies who have completed their busy working life.
He started at only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitation/comedian on television for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in front of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black," Henry performed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a big audience.
But this "years of award-winning light-pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures that mocked British black culture as well as celebrating, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known among other things as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his BBC series Lenny.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just taking the time or getting a little on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought it was mostly for a middle class domain, white in pantyhose and a cabbagehead in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt yourself if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could make it.
It was almost as if someone had put my head right at last.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while repairing the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That also came well, so it is like a great shield of gods who tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through with humorous outbursts while he constantly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I want to, but overall I don't have as much as before.
I'll ask him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up that again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Hutis called for civil disobedience in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets on Monday in Sanaa, said a spokesperson of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huti leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the sheet, with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Hutis are fighting for more independence from Sunnily-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The people of the Huti have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the major access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding country there are always bloody struggles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registered officials to contain "spiritual workers"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically in order to remove "minor employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their resignation from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his inauguration in 2013.
In an audit at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 pounds) per month were lost in payments for "spiritual staff" and other abusive financial practices.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials now need to appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, has been notified in a government message.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology were removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also by correcting the salary list at both levels of government - so the "minors" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach is being negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, claim damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil trial at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million euros.
This was announced by a judge on Monday.
The plaintiff states that Achenbach had cheated on the purchase of works of art and oldtimers and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than the purchase prices actually paid.
This would also result in a higher level of the agreed commission.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children Need Roots and Wings
Forty-four years he was in school, 23 of them as headmasters.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershausenrs and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always borne by his striving to see the people in the student.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was already interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were evicted.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
That's how it hit judges in the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten kilometers to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometers across the city to the school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he completed the first and in 1954, after three years, Master's degree.
Since Upper Franconia had no free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved to a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach at the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to acquire the present building, which was expanded after Richter's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, at the expense of the municipality, had an additional work space built in 1997 and in the extension of cellar rooms, although this was not eligible for school building guidelines.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," Richter remembered gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report by a school council on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "That doesn't always work." Whether he only thinks his students or just like his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils struggled, they did not receive punishment from him, nor were they darkened for posterity.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two contractors come up against each other, even if there was to be a feather.
For the benefit of the school, judges as rector maintained a good relationship with then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the non-participating judge after his retirement to run at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
However, Judge was pre-elected in sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bikers enter the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten Intermediate stops
When cycling on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten rests, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of resting impressions was made: The 700 participants of the Hr4-Radtour with companion bikes enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
The participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel, where they had a concert by Van Baker & Band, under the motto "Radling and Celebrating on New Discovered Ways between Nidda and Kinzig".
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started his bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private operation Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, pruning, scattering and cheesecakes, which wonderfully gave the skilled cyclists the chance.
"These cakes can only bake landwives," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments could be obtained at the stand of the Geiß-Nidda Turnverein.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies of operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He earned it, after all he has fixed up already broken bike chains again today".
The mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the Trinkurhaus of Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise on the Bad Salzhausen radio.
Tobias Hagen, who has been on tour since the first Hr4 tour in 2004, was also able to get caught up in his career, but he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a little on the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collections.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they started again after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schotten Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (TSG), the park had received a beautiful ambience and, of course, one had prepared delicacies, such as flame cakes with a well-cooled spring whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as Executive Director of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for swinging movements under the open sky was used zealously despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, there was an increasing mix of citizens who were just as sensitive to the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb stations – including a concert with the Trenkwalders – were on the programme for cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on grounds of suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not give an immediate comment.
Among the arrested are 14 senior police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal organization and tapped telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her conduct as part of the activities led by the Islamic clergy Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexan Pasteckhow, headmaster of the school in Slavjansk, the daughter of Jazenjuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will be peace here at last and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud parade of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
She began her career with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the Board of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when Pearson's parent company's top position went to a younger male colleague.
Their redemption was said to be nearly £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former BP president, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory Councilman.
As early as May, I described the position of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust has two main effects: inwards on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But which new chairperson would risk taking on everything and taking away an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps putting himself around his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that wasn't enough, many people are also interested in seeing the BBC down - power, money and status overtake.
As competition draws closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC poses special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is certainly buying into the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households, each of which costs only 40 pence a day.
And it seems that the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my mobile today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that descending tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the democratic District Attorney, who is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry user account that rejected the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and have deleted it," said the later news.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets went out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
The former tweet drew an unfavorable picture of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to tax in April 2013 for drunkenness.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, leading to an accusation against Perry - which might possibly be 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple permitted alcohol level ... but when I do, I charge Governor Perry when he ploughs it out."
I'm the most drunk democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers applied to the judge responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money from the State's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided for a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he finished fifth at the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidate in 2012, Perry went into speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo about himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley again explains apartment market for "normal"
One of the most prominent construction contractors in London pointed out that the housing market in southeastern England was "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set upper limits on mortgage credit due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the top-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal levels of transaction since its peak in 2013" and added that it offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed to the capital.
According to information from the Katasteramt, prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales total.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, cheap and student offers rose by about one fifth last year and were at the end of April by £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made property property in London less attractive in recent months for foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric by a possible "wild tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger loan allocation arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth both in real estate sales and in prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its prediction for the rise of property prices in London down to 3 percent in 2015, based on an already dwindling domestic price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now dropped by a quarter year by year, according to the real estate agent WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amount due for future sales amounts to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, future sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent each year to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would be expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be £450 million.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon in London's trade.
Nude photos by Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photos of the Oscar Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master List" of pictures of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and complained about the hacker's "crlatant violation of privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on Photo Sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're so happy with yourselves," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however argues that it was about pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FEELING, people.
Let's fight the beginnings. *Wordplay intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the pop star Ariana Grande rejected the authenticity of her alleged photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so one could best describe it, they slowly dissipated like a cardboard box that was left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant and perhaps a bit scratchy.
Then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He's been up to date, like in hedgehogs, yeah.
The last victim of this industriousness was a just beginning affair, which had been much more promising for the relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who held Kevern for her aunt and who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in the bathrooms were still spiders, nude snails had left their traces on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, which looked like huge cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
With Ailinn, Kevern had sat on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them were mentally absent from the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long forgotten black entertainer, to which his father had gladly listened at closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolescent, as the word obsolescence.
The general taste of what laws and regulations had never done, and how people in books chose the Von-Tellerwäscher-to-Millionaire-Memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing great feet in a gross-comic serenade Ailinn.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game at the time, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
The people wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody, where it would end.
It's just as intellect.
His unpredictableness made people nervous.
And jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again applicable, no laws or constraints.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as those spared by fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports by means of temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were entrusted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service telephone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks broke the plate.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levantes whose grandparents had not left the country quickly when WHAT WAS HAPPENED WAS BEING out of fear of being accused of fire-scuring, for fear even that the flames would devour them next – had opened labneh and shisha pipes restaurants, kept themselves in mind and became depressed with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was hard for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just uttered to her could ever be disillusioned.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound suppression of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world but her uncombed ravenous black hair.
There was nothing else he would have liked to see.
"If you say so," she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
Your feet aren't that direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm that was needed to curb the atrocities inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red and got out of her deck chair, threw the console and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblossom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to shudder, like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dick is exactly the reason why I feel drawn to you," she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she stood up against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same bewildered men, with even thicker skin and more devastating according to THE WATER, when their ancestors had been smugglers and beach robbers, always went from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would've shown her a big fist if she didn't take care of her!
It was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the unspeakable love ballads from the console - first hug them and then beat them.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the Knutschen itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through their bodies.
He got out of the deck chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but the strength of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him see how he got away - as if from a room on the upper floor her companion saw him do - a man, complained by something he had sworn up himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was it a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the recent incidents, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public opinion, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium levels in exactly those parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, would have been best expected, in the light of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"A lot has already been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the inborn aggressiveness of a people who have waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness was historically rarely felt despite the high-questioning church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion he continues to arouse.
The people cry when hearing sentimental ballads, are intoxicated with stories about overcome difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless not only the former rawness keeps the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nut Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nut Tree replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
Feminist?
Keep quiet again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz concluded, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unprofitable job.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may occasionally distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "backward" and "raw" could be interpreted by others just as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to wander around what is happening when it is happening, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking on its essential vitality.
Esme Nut Tree looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than that written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to get out of," answered Esme Nut Tree with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not been healed as effectively as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that have only been made to THE HISTORY, IF IT HAS BENEFITED.
But this time it's not the others we're letting out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you say that they would have left out their "wrath" and their "confidence" to "others".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From that, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured to throw, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether bad or good has been done, what has happened has happened.
That was back then.
There is nothing to be said about this - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be assigned, no debt has to be extinguished if such a redemption would be appropriate and if there is a way to eliminate it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget them.
If I may say anything about this -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcyclist who, as described by passers-by, had gone on foot in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says that no coup d'état is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho objected to plan a coup d'état to overthrow the government and said that they opposed police officers who were accused of armed with political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded its seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no coup d'état, but the military responded to the threat posed by "political fanatics", whose weapons were imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several intelligence reports that within the police there were some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
"Even if no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military announced on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating into their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the Vice Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metzing takes over the leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he had become the target.
In Lesotho there has been great tension since June after Thabane postponed parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his united government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, contrary to any accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, with a study closely observed.
The final Markit purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced break-in at a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall appear before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with the euro area's slowdown and for the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information this week on whether he is considering a quantitative facilitation for the euro area, according to those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a concern child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
It is also not reassuring to note that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism no longer take place in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry in the August Eurozone is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life rather difficult at present, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be "more and more likely" that the ECB would finally have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militia in a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death at the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of Beslan's school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in horror, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death from the atrocities in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children like them die - will now end.
The girl who was photographed trying to get back into the broken school sports hall
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov and famous when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the smashed school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run around my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were flooded.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday, "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says.
"That's what happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to that not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russen goes to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in his mother Tamara's arms.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Frightened, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying toddler, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who shut his son out of his arms, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara had stammered outside and had leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Dair was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to fade in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids that I played with in the yard and that didn't make it out there.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially at the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-air car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly recalls her journey to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I remember Damir wanting to eat borsch and calling all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waitresses in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British shared our pain so willingly and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our children.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
With this he grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes laid down on the sofa, turned his face away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys. Dimir is now 17, bigger than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to my feet, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember calling him, "Damir, run, run," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, unlike many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear when he ran around his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before she hurried to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date draws, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always haunt me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day when Georgij wanted to go to school, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we'll ever know the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the collapse of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is going to be a terrible place.
"I can't understand how that's possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing at all in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical college in Vladivostok.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted to.
I sent in my documents, including the medical personnel, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this, and of course they should not suffer it either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse if the anniversary gets closer.
I will go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be even more intense for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It stays inside of us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operating several times, he can run, but he can't play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and they cost me dearly.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I will never forget how my heart leaped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could only grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so grippingly carried in safety by a special operation command
Saved: Aljona Tskaeva is secured by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their atrocities they held back their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous plague.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana has a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of having run girls over on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands before the court on a pedestrian crossing in Fife because of the passing of a three-year-old girl.
Gordon Steward is accused of having hit a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The charge states that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, out of Anstruther, contests the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC started the trial for January.
4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both have to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth to which your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many will not pass.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, Action Cams usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look this underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you do a lot of footage.
If your camera has a rowing mode with which a number of recordings with slightly changed exposure settings are made, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse, the further you remove yourself from the surface.
If possible, you will stay close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to approach your objects more closely if they are to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to saving both the agony of the disease and the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important for diagnosis and disease, while the patients are mainly concerned with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had a hard time picking up.
As he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently accusing his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather do everything right away than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The results of the X-ray were available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breast skin, that is, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Great Britain since the 1960s, when industry voluntarily undertook to stop using it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumber, construction worker, carpentry and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems to be hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing today the climax of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the hostages of the Mesothelioma are not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no shelter.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to get well, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and porters - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately, he could at least partly answer that question.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from Mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one alive."
How many of us are still ill?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliophrenic patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still ill?"
The UK's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die that way.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn for damages claims, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioma has already spread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most common asbestos found in buildings.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less deadly than other asbestos forms, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "high health risk" with possible death outcomes.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Crokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there is clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, which states that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known suspension by work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government might have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be suffocated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that £1 billion of work has to be done over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that according to the general elections in 2015, MEPs will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never precisely determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were made positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where you have worked and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he got such a fever.
He was 45, and just late in the evening he had an operation.
All of a sudden, I had shivering.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the ride home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains from the breast, the skin around his lungs touched.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Wondered doctors took X-rays from his chest and started pleuracathether to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient abbotts with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not link this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
To be honest, I hadn't been so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was Mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings were now ill.
And so Mesotheliom meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulations in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving for the patients, but life threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Pupils put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And in the meantime, such innocent objects in our houses as flooring panels or shed roofs have by default contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's contained in much of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that involved a woman concerned was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor "How long have I got?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly creepy because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pressed from the process of breathing to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well in mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the breast skin," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man support and consulting office for co-workers.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he cheerfully introduced himself on calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last for four months and his life is expected to be extended for only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson managed, however, "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be assigned, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best available therapies.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many people are concerned about another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognised that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally added their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the examination of his death, however, a spokesman for Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for Mesothelioma sufferers who are trying to compensate, it is a huge problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claim know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to file a claim for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove a contact but can't sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have attributed to them in a normal damages trial - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesothelioma-related people that £350 million represented a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone over it and Mesotheliom's disease found the companies and could sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven deaths, rapid action is needed every day.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December of last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see that again and again in patients.
There's something that'll keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very strenuous.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm not anymore, for example, or my wife shows how the boiler time setting works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that wouldn't make me old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesothelio-Merkranken, such conversations have not gone through with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as it finally did for Stephen Jay Gould) a fierce security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China denies Hong Kong's right to government election, protesters swear retribution
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists were leading the way in planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
People of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the admission of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants elect the government chair from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote for the Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership remains firmly in the hands of a closely controlled nomination committee controlled by Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates are to be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to cut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters within a few hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers announced that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action to take place only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures in front of the government building, including police forces and barricades, were in force.
The unrest is intensified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The arrival of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
In addition, fear is growing that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, as it jeopardized the business operation - Hong Kong's Lifeline.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to be afraid that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
In this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
Tens of thousands took part in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region's history in July.
The tradition of the graduation balls in the USA is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances are offered by private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxurious travel service to students today.
The company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1 in order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security section.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut their habit in a dangerously charged car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to this year ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the tuition fees of £9,000 a year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as being abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month see themselves facing a crisis of living costs, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at the student home.
Feminists criticise racial and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands to the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex ahead of the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West rose and were noticed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, the personal essays with titles such as "Thought to Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism is not only about the suppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism many people are found talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light, to which black Americans are exposed every day, but which are not considered as "women's issues" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now link the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women fighting for women's electoral rights like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand for the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When one remembers such things, one becomes aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms had the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, demanding more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will bring about the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the issue of race in America are astounded.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contrast with her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently imposed a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is in the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilises women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as an essential topic of women, they would only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Swiss House" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - one of which was also a pig that had laid his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"The photo, however, was erroneously published and has now been removed," said one of the company's spokesmen.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with one bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
House sales in the social media attracted interest when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW City of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after lottery win
A lottery player from Harvey is at it this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues with a lucky winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery draw on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the drawing of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the profit would provide conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a gain might occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a proper conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had just a few weeks before won the $7.5 million mega win.
The winner couple had been playing for twenty years and said that winning allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bathed in the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood knee-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful array of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owners "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert performer and successively sent his men into the ring to a heroic two-fight in various gladiatorial genres.
First the "provocators" were on the row with rectangle shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with chest shield, short sword and vulture as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who came up against the "Secutor" with nets of litter, trident and dagger, and after a short fight pushed the boy to the ground.
Since the swords were metallically working together, the shields created and the litters flew surringly through the arena, that a fear and anxiety could become for the health of the gladiators.
But the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had an ever-aware eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experience," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friendeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park for one day became an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today.
The remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, such as "Aquéduct marble" from the eleven-metre and 1400-metre Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society faced the supply of water and energy once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time."
This is also confirmed by the diploma surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented the measurement instruments of the Romans such as chorobat, groma or dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypokaust, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord commercial park in Rheinbach.
They found walls of an economic building with a darre for drying grain and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, suspected Morscheiser.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on waxboards, as did the Roman students.
At the stand of the Romans Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glass mosaics and at the stand of the nature center Eifel Nettersheim to serve a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a muesli.
The original Roman coach, drawn by two cold flowers, drove visitors through the leisure park and passed by the impressive stand of the Urban Gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Roman Year 2014, which was proclaimed throughout the Rhine, to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes and the Roman past of Wachtberg will be remembered.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the winding Wachtberg, presents plants as living monuments from the Roman era and presents a funny lesson in the understanding of peoples between a group of "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorf primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-examined at first glance.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will be recalled at the discovery of the Berkumer Matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Burdens West Africa’s Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies go on a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has added the region heavily.
Some international companies are already distanced.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is most affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only anyone who wants to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, where alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, the health authorities stated that the disease was advanced in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands more were killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
All over the resource-rich countries, companies are decommissioning their operations.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal steel group are withdrawing their employees and several international airlines are no longer flying on the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: Only a few merchants leave their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the most important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields are rotting.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert for the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population therefore gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, stocks of basic foods such as rice are disappearing.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies is at risk of image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugo of the French think tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
With investors, the impression could arise, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest as well," warns Hugo.
The disease is also affecting the tightened state budgets of the states
The disease is also affecting the state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely tightened by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also detectable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already left at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also go back significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary of its foundation from 12 to 14 September.
The preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September will take place at the Schützenverein Tannenwald.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6:00 p.m., there's a big bullying.
The evening of the mood is followed by the "Stoapälzer Spitzbuam" in the big tent.
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the feast service and 9.30 am in the parish church and the great celebration at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of German and German shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 party ladies with their Dirndln.
The chapel is the blasphemous chapel of Berngau.
The patronage has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by exercise in room and small caliber shooting".
In 1937, the Nazi regime caused the club to dissolve.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found again, who on April 30 at the Gasthaus Lukas raised Berngau from baptism the "new" Schützenverein "Tannenwald".
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooter through a difficult initial time, in which it was primarily about finding a club room and installing the shooting company.
As early as autumn 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sportsmen, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purzeled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of the active shooters has increased, so have the number of members.
After the club's location "Leininger" has no longer met the demands of a modern Schützenverein, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Father Strasser gave the ecclesial blessing to the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was surely the 44th shooting, connected with the solemn consecration of the new gunflake in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of its founding.
A Böllergroup was established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the Schützenverein can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sport pistol KK1, one youth team and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went up in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml rose from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as fencing, carnival and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With it, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went against the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke into round 172 and his evening ended.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better commitment and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart used to drive to a wall during the Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped out of three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities informed on Friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should expect an accusation.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was already shortly afterwards in the first 10 advances and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in round 122, Buschs got
Cars with no. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to number 21.
Looking for a young dancer who is happy to dance
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups on TV Jahn make it possible to create all-day lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have become strongly decimated.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more assets the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can enter the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, on Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or Fridays between 17 and 18.30 o'clock.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the coach.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore, classics, sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, socialism is not too short.
"We're also going to dinner, watch dance movies, and we've also stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not so, it can also be caught in one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always join classes in the fields of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop in the lessons.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango may look past and join in.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organised a nationwide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the Minister of Interim Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for one month and calling for a return to the former 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the Union of Prison Workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Mr Rosen Zhelyazkov of the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of the employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has given up Luhansk Airport
In the eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy fighting, in which Russian tanks were allegedly also involved, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, gave up the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
The army also announced that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had already drawn humane consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot off aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot down a fighter aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents reported that on Monday Russian agencies were injured or killed.
Coast Guard vessels submerged
The insurgents also claimed for the first time to have sunk two boats from the Ukrainian Coast Guard.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the port town of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, and a spokesperson in Kiev told the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital city of Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicise their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adhered to the founding agreement of the NATO Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a severe breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
From documents and statements of the Russian side, it appears "that they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced its intention to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to official data, Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, said Russian energy minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
A decision by the European Union was still to be taken whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting any more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Last but not least, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe draws around one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks word of power: Toll will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor confesses clearly once again.
But it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
The CSU was appalled by persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent resistance from her CDU, spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car toll.
"To be quite clear, it is in the coalition treaty, and it will come," said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
Merkel did not decide on a detailed model for the moment.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" were called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a "proposal and is now under way".
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no on a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) also contributed constructively to the discussion of a draft law.
In addition, he spoke with Dobrindt about further ways of activating more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house examined its own concept to reward motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never expected to kill all district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU president.
In this respect, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced to talk about the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landesverbanden Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition fidelity due to the toll critique from rows of the CDU.
The left considers that the plans have failed in view of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Minister fails with the toll". Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignett obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
National car owners may not, however, be subject to additional burdens under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to be fully compensated for the toll via the car tax.
However, the model must not, in accordance with EU law, prejudice foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A Briton says that as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, she thought she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell all the time and everything lasted longer.
I could never ride with the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was often in school to go and walk because of my kind.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I got an answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die at 25 and then slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills had not diminished as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the wheelchair right now."
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Dieter works as a fireman since the closure of the former military training site
For almost ten years, the former military training site in Münsingen has not been shot.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere region Schwäbische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang stops at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen military training site, which was closed after 110 years of military operations at the end of 2005.
Since that time the 6500 hectares of land have been the core of the biosphere region Schwäbische Alb, which is open on 13 marked paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Enterprises in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue of 2012 of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent last year, and it was the third year of growth consecutively after the several years of decreasing notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia earns 28 percent of the lowest tax income from companies.
Most of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in the real estate values of companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from major states such as California, New York, and Texas, the process seems to be true for Washington.
Businesses in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax returns.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, much of the property, especially in the D.C. tax area, is owned by either the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services offered by other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenue by enterprises cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend is in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The growth rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported an underaverage tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three districts, has the most significant corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local corporate taxes are required and overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will decrease to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the Washington area, and they therefore pay more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized to do - in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes total.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase of the general multi-recovery tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be lagging behind if the Federal Government's spending cut affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the Officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery were to settle in our city," said Vice-Secretary of the South Chinese Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion, the Chinese Communist Party’s functioner repeatedly came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to the project after a possible partner in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't take much: good water, grain and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated to Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the member of the staff from Guangzhou met with sheep-gümbel - but with red wine, which was served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German offer of purity.
More business
A second request from the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Party Chief Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 cancelled for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," proved the local politician convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
At present, travelers would have to take the detour over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangzhou, the capital of which is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the connection of flights.
The vice governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," answered Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Good Partnership
The obscene Vice-President of Guangzhou hopes that next year he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He did not enter office until this year after his predecessor had been transferred from office for accusations of corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, enforced with rigour by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new senior politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to joining Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the VW car builder built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9,000 kilometers away Guangzhou is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
With its economic power, the South Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen.
Next year she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers family "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since her delivery to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today expressed her hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We all push our thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors will keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that come into the market from now on.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners from September 1 will be given a label on which the buyer can detect at a glance central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
New cars are subject to more stringent nitrogen oxide values in the "Euro 6" pollutant class.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service by Google was decided for a cool billion things, and the collaboration also appeared naturally.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravours in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Besserwisser gives the (mostly older) games a painting of the secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was recorded somewhat bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come about, as the company reportedly was ready to pay as much as Amazon did.
All we know about at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sports than to watch, it is hard to understand the attraction that is expected to watch others at play instead of even taking control console in hand.
It's one thing to look a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she's sneaking through Resident Evil, and something quite different, watching a spider be shot in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid passages in which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics know about it?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money out of it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that any company would like to do: thousands of young men being recruited as advertising customers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the Hüpfburg at the Burggartenfest on Sunday night.
The organizers' concept was correct.
Despite the heavy rainstorm on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the intake had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt wort l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sakhraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzweder Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already evident on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors opened up to open air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply stands on the Burggartenwiese, Salzweder, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings had made it comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, tipped with the foot in a beat, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation and enjoyment were fashionable.
And that's right across the generations.
While one lurked on blankets on the extra-carried white sand at the beach bar, others clinged to a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the young man topped on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when making children, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do all their hands to become Lord of Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the goodfoot crew made of salt.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m., he chatted down on the visitors, especially families looking for far and dry.
But the attraction of the feast did not stop this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success all over the line".
That is why there is nothing against a repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still have to be worked on, Sem made it clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday compared to the voice of the people.
He said that the inauguration had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first conservative estimate, the Salzweder co-organizer spoke of some 1200 visitors who were tumbling in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound technology.
The salt welder hip-hop band blocks`n`Rox therefore interrupted its appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt because of a tire.
"But next year they'll be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the numbers of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will have to be removed for the first time, but at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers have to criticise.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you've just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Take off!" Stephanie Jenß writes about the amula.
The organisers now have a year to put an end to these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
This is not the case as expected.
Rather, the ready-to-lay component is waiting to be used in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is to change the cap
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new envelope will be set up.
If the weather is part of it, the action is scheduled to cross the stage at the beginning of this week.
A participant at the Ice Bucket-Challenge entangles jaws
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when she was poured ice-cold water over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went down painfully.
A woman was hospitalized after yelling so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she evicted herself from the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK circled so much when she was poured ice-cold water over her head that she violated her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stopped," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and almost laughed at me, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to allow the jaw to narrow down again after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times to Facebook and Twitter.
Will the Burgvereins soon get back on track?
The last two Wolfratshauser Burgverein were always divided.
Now the leaders are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views so far seemed very different, as to how the history of Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach should soon be held.
The association leaders Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) confirm this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we should get together once," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of both clubs could in the future draw back on one strand.
Thus, more rapid visible successes are to be seen.
While the Burgfreunde had in mind until last a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest around Sjöberg, for the Burgverein um Sjöberg, the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with his own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has stood before the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we let the club activities rest out of respect first." This "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make an up-to-date mood picture within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to run for himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to "but very much want to continue working on the project".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl's eyes in the near future.
He honours Dimbath as a "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
Because of a high level of involvement of the population, as well as voluntary volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have come to believe more and more that it makes sense to advance the project." A "single setting" feature could be created for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of rebuilding overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein may be moving a bit at this point.
Their goal to document history first, "is important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost for university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever spare idea.
He invented a loan system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, visiting the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management announced that students spent on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study material, but there were different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, announced that renting textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college books during the last spring semester, said Neebo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus books according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are to have at the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used to Buy
If the notes of other or normal traces of usage do not matter, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was resold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Apart from Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them well to some extent, remember to give them back and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Learn about the terms of the business you are renting, including the penalty charges that may apply to writing notes, underscores or traces of use.
Tenants minded: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time by wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can now be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Well, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will be attending Pepperdine Law School soon, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online you should check, says Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Was Not a Cashlaunder
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone recorded less than $30 million of his 90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The movie "Sex Tape" which was cut to Cameron Diaz recorded only 14.6 million dollars at the end of the opening week, while children's films such as "Dreak Tämen made easy 2" also disappoint the revenue.
An article by telegraph critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "dreams made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
For films for a slightly older target group, however, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film start, which was shown on at least 2000 screens between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinema visitors and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved revenues with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year's sales of 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics films and prophesied a "core melt" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashmen expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema bank at all, and no one will worry about the business any more."
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of tightening the league division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen's top-class team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, but in the coming season only plays fifth-class.
Four-class torpedoes ladies remain in the regional league despite their magnificent march.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve enter the new Association League, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttinger Clubs.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo Cross in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superliga South.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensensen, FC Weser and TTC are joining.
In the district league there are regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Bowender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district superliga of the ladies starts at least in sollstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here from the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With every nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The district league staff of the SCW boys - there even starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West Staffel there are Red-White II, Bowender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel play among others Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemellen, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more ladies teams at the circular level.
Remarkably, none of the six 2nd classes achieves a goal strength, here the innovative and enthusiastic circuit board will have to think.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On weekends there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter-tip.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us on the weekend and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Adolescents Escaped From the Blue Mountains
TWO youthful bush hikers were rescued with the rope winch after they were caught the night over in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up in Govett's Leap on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search squad from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man had crashed and had his head open.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were returned in a stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Anti-Governmental Protests Escalating in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators had been expelled from the PTV building by soldiers, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After more than half an hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial department.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Head of Government, whom they are accusing of electoral fraud.
The police reported that, about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there had been clashes with security forces on Monday of around 3000 protesters.
After hospitalization, a police officer was injured.
On weekends at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when protesters tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict to "spend without time and apply without violence".
The communication also stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been taking place since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri made similar comments.
Khan urges Sharif to win the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had at first remained peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them on weekends to advance to Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second victory in the season in third place of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday for Rapid has taken a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday with the Out in the Europe League.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and scorer Steffen Hofmann, who pushed green-white to third place.
With the second win of the season, the Schrammel Dream Gate will bring Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki and will go to the national game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, set the course for victory.
"I thought I'd throw in all the frost from Thursday and snuck it under the barn," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid generation," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvis, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and made his case very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position incorrectly.
He deserved the goal, he has already done some assists this year," praised Barisic.
The team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written about it.
"Thank God we've had some luck today," said Schrammel, who thus referred to the gaping performance and result over the past few weeks: "The results haven't been right, but the playful was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that one had been "better than today in many games" - against "the strongest team that played in this season at this stadium".
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is the setbacks to the intact: "Today my team has shown that it has a character".
Not less pleasing to him: "That we finally played to zero again".
A lot of work during a country play break Even the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimplesberger there are several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their startel debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," Barisic warned, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the last three days, "who have been very stable lately".
The national game break should therefore be used in order to " lick wounds and add a bit to the physical area", said Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One that is probably particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids not only the structure but also the second goal before his exchange in the 68th minute.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly also had a bit of luck, but at some point happiness must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
He warned, of course, to continue to work: "You can't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been depicted.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role in the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They do stick to me in certain phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-receiver "out of the category of magic gate", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly known by arbitrator colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We've had too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started just as badly, then we found it in and even made a goal.
By and large, there would have been more in there.
There's rest under this tip.
We showed a mighty tribe in our summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the pictured copy is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweitenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the oak about 600 years old.
It goes past couplers, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stands out over the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a magnitude of over eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheim Archive and asked older people from Unterweitenbrunn to find out what kind of work it has with the gißruheiche.
The result of his investigations remained the fairly sober explanation of the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds should have driven their animals from under-white brown to the laboriously reded and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers who are exhausted from ascension should have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because the meadows are actually grazing goats again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, for the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular residence for herdsmen.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweitenbrunn to the tree, but it is a little hidden.
Further paths are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön rises and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the water castle?
A water castle, which is sought at our next task, is, however, rather rare to find at the height.
The mirroring in the trench already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district to which the building counterfei could fit.
Where is our "piece of the Rhöner Glück"?

After a week's retreat, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the European Union, Matteo Renzi, has held the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, and will succeed the British woman Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the government-related daily La Repubblica reports, the appointment of his Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to keep the left party base that is always against him calm, for Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit in a moderate way.
Compared with the conservative representatives with the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, thus producing political compensation.
The EU's chief diplomat will also represent the Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament's still outstanding approval is considered to be secure.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have mentioned the nomination of 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) as "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for almost two decades, Mogherini has been proving himself to be "eternal challenges" in leading party offices and known for her ambition.
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which joined today's Social Democratic PD with the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With her election in 2001 in the Party Council of Left Democrats she joined the High Party Policy, she worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head soon became her.
She occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy participates with a force quota, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the USA.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he named Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country that contributed to the party's more than 40 percent votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share.
The reservations in Brussels that the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, so if there is no substance, are addressed in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's untrauistically realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are being persecuted and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is to be transported directly to southern Europe through the Russian natural gas bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi's term of office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as that they invited the Kremlin chief for October to a Milan economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
The new employees will be active in four training professions in the future: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bühl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidt, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfree and Sebastian Zahner from Pfremd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday the trainees of all vintages as well as the trainers will go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," said the most important ally of Francois Hollande.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet transformation has come upon disapproval by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay with him," he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a relaxation of the rules of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "joined" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered Sand into the gear of a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant digging struggles and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive autumn or winter," said Ms. Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated her party's call after the dissolution of Parliament and said that she was confident to be the winner in preferred elections and was ready for the government.
The ruling party of France was defeated in the municipal elections in March, and the national front, right-wing, was at the forefront of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch term of office 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, has advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% share in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to be able to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the next few years is expected to grow due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to approval authorities, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent share in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have over 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the Prestige Cruises stock exchange.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking faithful group waved near the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law that allows only two or three candidates for the Hong Kong leadership election in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be composed of peking faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and led pro-democracy activists to perpetuate their threat and to paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the calls for democracy are spreading to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's supremacy over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's survey is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macaus Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in the afternoon in front of the head office in Hong Kong.
Until the final phase of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain did not foresee any democratic elements.
Putin asks Kiev to open "Statehood talks" with the Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and begin negotiations directly on the "Statehood" of the apostate region.
His spokesperson, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits in with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots five months ago: help for the separatists in taking over territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region of Novorossija to achieve actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossija" or "Neurussia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct. 26 and while government groups in the areas held by separatists, hope to be "captured in their illusions", said Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately engage in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state of South-East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Pekkov said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It's not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it's about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct Putin's "fail interpretation" made it clear that Russia's leading claim was to deal with the separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period gave a broad majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects the Russian territory with the Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - be considered as a constitutional addendum allowing the respective territories to have greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the hand stroke, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have started to secure Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoasovsk and narrow access to the Crimea peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urgently asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just in front of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership called for further sanctions against Russia to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovajsk after two Russian tanks columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andri Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said reporting on Saturday in Kiev.
On Sunday, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included in the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk, were exchanged for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, told Lysenko on Sunday.
A nude photo scandal around Australian Promise and Gabi Grecco
Geoffrey Noblest didn't make a heck of his anger about hackers who probably stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecco and a who is who of the A-promise from Hollywood.
The film city is intrigued after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Among the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Gregko from Melbourne were allegedly also private photos due to an iCloud gap audience.
The list includes 101 celebrities.
The noblest who had engaged to Grecco last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecco, currently in New York, reports that a news website said that the hack was "disgusting" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she lies upstairs without in a pool.
Among the films Palmer's "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sugar Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It is a horrible violation of privacy."
actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a mobile phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
From a legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer were present yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großen Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour, one of which was a torture, was an easy training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove the bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
The small muscle catheter can easily be put away, since the participation on the 8th wheel on the Großen Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do it - fine!"
Small breaks on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants were tormented yesterday in the early tau to mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the well eleven-kilometre-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green Politician who appeared in red from the day of the circle - red dress, red bike - did something on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathlessness.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson of the city of Oberursel, who had joined Frank Grüneisen on his way.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is about Charity, we like to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way, they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had come down to Oberursel in the morning to strumm back to the altitude immediately after that.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung to the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was also fun to have "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are just part of it.
He had indicated 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambitious race biker".
He must have been, because he was on the road with the "Fixie-Rad", but they're also racing bikes, but without a circuit...
The fact that it went up easily without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, took care of safety, said: "I know that" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled trail, only that he pulls the sled himself."
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent to the track in the morning in groups.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln auf den Großen Feldberg", gave the start-commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will manage to block the route up to Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
