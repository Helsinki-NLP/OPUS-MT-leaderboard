Welcome!
It wasn't great.
Easy prison, easy past.
Has everyone found their mistakes?
Where does your uncle live?
The house was quiet.
I let my feelings darken my judgment.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we crossed the ice.
Why doesn't Tom ever come see us again?
That's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper does not absorb ink.
It hurts my knee when I bend on it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go right away.
Tom sneaked down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a reading plate in a Christmas present.
She plays hockey on weekends.
You don't talk much.

I remember the first time.
This is a very time-consuming task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Nasse.
It meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom's teaching.
She's taken on too much work.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a hand.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never get along.
It is uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You dropped your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
She cried.
Can I see Tom today?
No one wants it.
Who destroyed this?
How do you think I feel?
A Japanese garden usually has a pond.
I'm not feeling well at all.

Tom's depressed.
You should have seen her.
I need to buy stamps.
Playing tennis is his hobby.
Tom did a good job.
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?

Now try it.
It didn't really affect us.
Tom's voice?
I'm going like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're taller than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like going to new places and seeing new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bore me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless someone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I've got a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Sex was invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's being elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the story about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thanks for taking care of my dog.
She advocated gender equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Greetings, brother-in-law.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't betray me during the trial.
Tom shot me in the leg.
I was just teasing.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here comes Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.
The line of the test cabins rang through the store.
I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Get back in the van.
She helped the old man across the road.
No one's too old to learn.
I would do anything for love.
Two men with ski masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
None of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a pretty girl.
This tree is not even close to being the tallest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My father is healthy.
We can save a lot of lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquito bites.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to speak to Tom in private.
He will fall for the temptation.
The TV isn't working.
I can explain.
She behaves like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have different opinions than you do.
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you done?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I give a secret after my Internet addiction.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it?
Tom flashed the candle.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here named.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
That's got to do.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My chainsaw's broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
An octopus has ten arms.
She didn't show up before two.
I am.
It was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finns, about 4.9 per cent are Finnish, i.e. people with Swedish as their mother tongue.
Unfortunately, Tom left.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding cake.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house were not straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the wheel to the right.
I'm in the attic.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everyone's dreaming.
Flour is made of wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd sense.
At home, I discovered the break-in.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.
Christ has risen!
I need your opinions.
I've had a rough afternoon.
Will you wait for us at the station?
I don't see anyone.
The more you get to know her, the more you'll like her.
Give Sami and kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We need to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
Can I think about it?
When did you see Tom?
It's not important!
Strange things happened on her birthday.
