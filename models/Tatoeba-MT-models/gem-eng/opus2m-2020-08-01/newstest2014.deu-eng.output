Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33-footwalk ramp at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall lamp.
Two installations so close to each other: intention or signpost?
This question was clearly answered yesterday by Gutach's mayor.
"The town hall lamp was installed at the time because it secures the school road," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"At the high traffic and pedestrian turnout, another traffic light had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg County Council.
"According to current measurements on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy goods vehicles," Arnold stresses.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also thought of, however, because of the narrowness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the selection of the traffic lights in the past: "In the middle of an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks of loaded transporters, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without reversing the traffic lights".
The EUR 15 000-cost traffic light plant itself is the "modernest thing on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so strongly that the lights can be seen by the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is economical too: The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, immediately green comes for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks to see if the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will safely cross the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver had to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: almost showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle went through - with a bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the fad of raw violence and blunt sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner award winner is known mainly as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresaker presents a collage of prosatexten for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungspitze", which can now be seen in garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family belauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty-spaced stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which is supposedly copulated and masturbated - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance adds a wealth of directing influences to the template, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
The actresses, in particular, are at the heart of the sometimes questionable staged implementations.
They are hit hard, dipped with the head under water, tucked with their evening robes on the wall.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stuck on dangerously high piles through the stage stage, either monologue loudly or lie completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this strenuous way.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only in the end will the overdriven performance come to rest, and Winkler's absurd humor just flashes.
A blackbox in the car?
US road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of each car.
The devices that record every kilometer of traffic and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the States to revise the obsolete system of financing American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometers of traffic, and possibly where they have been driven, and then use the information to calculate tax savings.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on an approach, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we'll only possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is here.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by the US Americans at the bar, is broke.
But in America, not as much is being thought of as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 cents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for a cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," says Lee Munnich, an expert in transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most long-term alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats call it a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is accepted by urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state for climate change.
However, Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees in it the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea to let drivers pay by distance.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," says Adrian Moore, Vice President for Guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, had invited Congress to move towards miles-based settlement.
Last year the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently promoting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how the change could be introduced.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow each of their movements.
"Threat against Big Brother and such things was a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the Nevada ACLU warned: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance equipment."
There is no need to build a huge, bulky technological infrastructure which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can track the miles travelled, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would be more calm.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not start to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, in which drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles travelled.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee on the basis of the average miles travelled by all the residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a vehicle for taxation, which also pays parking fees, insurance only has to be paid for driving kilometers and speed data from other vehicles in real time can be collected, thanks to which the driver can avoid traffic.
"Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, officials explained that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little team beats waker
The volunteer fire brigade managed its autumn main exam despite staff shortages with bravour.
Only eleven men participated in the exercise.
Head of Department Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder on Burgberger Straße in his practice.
There should have been a short circuit when sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two shields of breathing were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead them to the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguisher attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overfloor hydrant at about 100 meters distance.
Now three erasure attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went about the exercise to show what to do with little staff available.
In case of emergency, support is given via the Königsfeld daily group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, the country president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow came from.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he examined this important question together with the executive school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the county gymnasium and the chairpersons of the parental counsellors.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre in the Walderstadt.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but also to look at the phase of caring for family members due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor was the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already met the benefits of the region during their studies often retain their acquired knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," was the country's president's conviction.
Only if adequate training places are offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in south-west Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train trip from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Stand firm and make public transport better," he explained to the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, older citizens were accommodated in the rest area.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were entertained with usual melodies.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the leading boundary of the pre-refurbishment old schoolyard to Kirchstraße is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, to stabilize and static relief of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, says that the Landesdenkmalamt is involved in the planning and to create a refurbishment concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts, which will then be placed on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further course of action.
A decision on this is expected to be taken in the coming year.
After the renovation, plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in the foreseeable future, to refurbish the refurbishment-needed border walls from ground to ground and to put them on new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water damage and frost damage, as there is no drainage, need to be renovated and has a bow slope towards the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of damage to weather, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use schoolyard, which has been done by the current fastening work.
Originally, schoolyard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures resulted in a shift.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be shared by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If regulations come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monumentists.
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants Jazz Training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined in.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart Music University," Özdemir said the "Stuttgarter News".
Jazz and classical music belong at the jazz location Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate to the Bundestag election on 22 September, the Green-Red State Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this research forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
The study program Jazz and Pop will then be transferred from the University of Music in Stuttgart to the University of Music in Mannheim.
U.S. border: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the USA, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
The tunnel had not yet been put into service.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said U.S. Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this had been discovered at the end of the tunnel.
To the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of lifelong withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Usually cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Flagship in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one of them being Mexicans, it was said.
You're gonna have to pay for up to ten years' imprisonment.
2014 will be Geisinger Festive Year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250th anniversary.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary year will come to an end.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were mentioned together for the first time in the document.
In churches, a document was produced that mentions both places.
On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time, in church houses.
During the anniversary, a number of events are planned in Geisingen, as well as in church houses.
Church Houses will be 1250 in July on a weekend from 18th to 20th July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a ceremony, Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend there is also the church-house feast.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date will be the last week of September, on September 27th and 28th.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about today's Geising, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's Geising also celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21st or 22nd at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also another year with many birthdays.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a wedding evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen is 90 years old and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1st to 4th May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate of gift, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which was a court of law at the time.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same document.
Reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes a look at track systems
Should the railway crossing "On the Hirschen" be heavily rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the councils decided.
Schiltach must take over 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal line next year.
In particular, the safety of crossings is to be increased - there are frequent collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must participate with one third in the costs, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltachs Stadtbaumeister Roland Gleißhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the Bahtransgang "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a reservation at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, in counter-traffic traffic without having to block the tracks.
Greßeber therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road at the given time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road traffic: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the critics' mood to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The crossing "Hirschen" was regularly used for long-haul transport.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" was transported partly over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn to the main road.
In addition, the route served as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel must be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport impact for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to examine the costs of the proposed extension of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the refurbishment of the railway crossing has been agreed by a majority with the condition that the necessary supporting wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could cause a very different problem regarding access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the railway refurbishment plans examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, as she had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was then possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the road inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles being loaded.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
Thus, the conversion could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber take-off and the turn-off worked in the current state of expansion, Haas argued that the conversion of the railway crossing should not be accepted.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition was significantly lower than that of the other crossings, because directly adjacent to the centre of the stop with which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main railway station should have been slowed down at this point so far that no collision is imminent.
The majority of the amendments were rejected because the city of Schiltach had to "pull out" the problem of rolling vehicles, so the councils could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The Board considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: Missions for billions
Far planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the race.
Far worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are lives on some of them or not, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or after earthlike planets, discovering alien life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are to make research a decisive step forward.
The budget for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were being debated, five of which have now come into the narrower elections.
Numerous bodies review the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme initiated in 2007 should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from great gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the utter darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, the Space Telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017 with which 500 already known planetary systems will be explored more closely in our near environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately to reveal what conditions exist for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle irradiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be exemplified.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this issue.
The probe is to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come into existence and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter, made up of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were in force in the first seconds of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made up of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M mission here, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, enabling conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves, has the best chances of being granted L-Mission.
This includes physicist changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission foresees a two or three probe detector stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also prove waves of gravitation that were created at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended, among other things, to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which aims to detect and investigate Earth-like planets.
These include proposals for the transport of samples by Mars, the exploration of moons, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US intelligence service, has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and announce before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a violation of fidelity and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defence is possible."
To tell the truth is not a crime.
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The US Department of Justice charges include espionage and theft of state property.
German Minister of the Interior Hans-Peter Friedrich said against time online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible."
Relations between the USA and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service, said that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, "without jeopardizing him and ruining relations with the United States completely".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he needed a guarantee that he would be safe there, the honourable Member said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that expelled him from his homeland.
It was, however, touched by the global response to my 'action of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have identified the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit for the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities, "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers who want to stow hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement on Wednesday was that passengers should keep the whole box.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travelers who paid only on the flight path.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines started in 2008 to charge fees for the first and second baggage.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into the hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overfilled.
Charges are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may carry a luggage free of charge at the Frontier flight path, but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a similar luggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedure would change, so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they would arrive at the flight path.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only come into force in summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often scold over luggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the carriage of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish.
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most, however, leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first charges for hand luggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee was Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is paying the additional fees carefully.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the hand luggage fee Spirit brings in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leading position with Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious about what would be expected on the flight path if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the most successful I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I was expecting to see toothpicks and hand-cuffed discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding ran like lubricating."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole can and be filled with coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
In 2008, U.S. Airways had tried to demand money for soft drinks, but it returned seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had moved.
Frontiers Step to charge fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontiers have, however, gone most widely in this area.
In September, the company began to grant only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced once again to 25 percent of the flight distance.
Therefore, a flight booked with a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book places only when buying directly on Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The proceeds decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be read in the financial report published by the parent group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs Comes From the Bible
Well 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house were "Bible Words" and "Medical Uses".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, attended the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Languages contain life sciences, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Wooden eyes be watchful, as sheds fall from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone who gives it to His Lord in sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners what the saying was.
The medieval sayings of Christel Dehner, the church community, accepted: All good things are three, blue, a little hay.
She explained the meaning and origin of the sayings she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round, mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger mixed up.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is being launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate today.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for three winters to experts for hotels and restaurants.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert of Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA states that an “internal error” and not hacker are due to the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency stated on late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public site for a few hours and not hacker, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov could not be reached for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update," explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Previously, a spokesman from the NSA had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority had been compromised "in no way".
Secret information is not in danger, the speaker says.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and, after the revelations made in recent months, sees itself exposed to the widespread surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service sparked initial speculations that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyberoperation.
The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate is 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Many farms have so far reacted to attitudes.
According to Feld-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, health care and old-age care".
Since September, there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector.
The winter season begins in mid-December.

Loss of profit in Bombardier after decline in delivery volumes and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profits on Thursday after it was put under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
Up to now, only three additional take-offs have followed on the test aircraft's maiden flight, which makes it appear questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his evaluation from "outperform" to "sector performance" on Thursday with a view to a limited price potential for the next one to two quarters.
"Although the delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be weaker, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the aircraft test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time after months of delays in September.
However, until now binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, management also assured analysts and media that the programme was on schedule.
"The test aircraft has no longer been on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft's service life had been on ground tests and software updates.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it was called by the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it was checking the plans for commissioning (EIS) and would update them in the coming months.
"The slow advance of the flight test – although obviously consistent with Bombardier's internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars and 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars and 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of 4.56 billion dollars, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims to have delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order base in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore unchanged from 31 December.
"In the field of aeronautics and space, the results were disappointing within the framework of our guidelines, but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole," said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace industry fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment increased by just under 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order book in the transport segment was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly increased compared with 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by the problems of settlement in some major contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent and was $4.83 in Canada, after it was also announced that the Google finance manager Patrick Pichente will change to the board of directors.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier’s tightest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX Airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management told Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security officer had also been killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed about the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a shooter with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have shouted and children would have cried.
There was panic among the waiters, many had hidden behind chairs for fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler from the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene had been "like in a movie".
After that, the man reported that he himself had been taken to a security area.
The shots should have fallen close to a security control area.
Airport buildings evacuated
There were TV pictures showing numerous ambulances and police cars running in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were rescued from the building.
Users published on Twitter photos of a special operation commando and a gun lying on the ground.
The incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time) at 9.30 a.m., as the airport management reported via Twitter.
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backsliding.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily stopped.
However, several planes were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation has to go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal who warned a drug lord against a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The first-class lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner at the bar.
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information on to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted on Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession at an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court it was announced that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A had been discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "secret of law".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
At the police hearing, he stated that he was running an office under his private address as well as at the workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court it was known that he had called and informed important actors in drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, of significant arrests and what the investigators knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal, as he has been too enlisted with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted against the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out every misbehavior and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal from a criminal as soon as he began to buy drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guilty of conspiring to trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total 153 years of punishment for drug offences.
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent his client as lawyer in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Song Crane Dunningen will reframe two divine services with the "German Fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which impressed the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 on at the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10.15 a.m. to the church of St. John Baptist in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Singing for the Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its formation.
The trade fair is performed within the framework of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: skepticism softens eye-catching confidence
For example, the elections to the parish in 2015 will fundamentally change in the Haslach (SE) care unit.
There is then only one common parish for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to be changed in the diocese's basic decisions and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new one is hesitant, but it seems to me that there is a sense of confidence.
From the conceptions and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the pastoral care team were extended.
The regional dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for the Seelsorgeuniten in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
In the future, the SE Haslach as a church community will form an agency of public law, which will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches so far.
There will only be a joint parishioner and a foundation council in which the parish priest Kraft Amtes is represented.
Each parish should represent at least two elected members, in which six parishes are formed so-called local parishes.
Their task will be to promote ecclesial life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then showed considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated assets remain assigned to parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there was great concern.
"Even in the past only investments were made in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," relativized Haslach's parishioner Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Seelsorgeunit Schutterwald-Neured.
In 2006, they had made themselves the task of "being one, staying five" and had to find that this is not that easy.
The Haslacher Seelsorgeunits then made an effort to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The work will be made concrete at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
In the end, pastor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorgeunit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As confirmed by the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, compared to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorfer family will incur 70 to 90 Euro extra costs per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This amount is fixed annually by the four operators of the major electricity routes in October.
These figure the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can charge by way of a charge above the electricity price.
The municipal works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
In his forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher figure, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - drive at Red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time had to be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before a malfunction of the traffic light can occur.
However, those who continue the ride despite red light must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who is patient for less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Hamm Supreme Court.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of permanent redness and had to take responsibility for a careless red light.
The traffic light was not defective, but only turned to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Municipal Council is pleased with a sound household
Whenever it comes to the household in municipal councils, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not been known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be accounted for as a full success in this respect.
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher feed from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment has been made than planned in the financial year 2012, there has also been a higher return on investments.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils were visibly pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon cost the citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to refrain from high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, the country's subsidies had often been curtailed.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory amounts.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the issue of raising rates, because in the coming years investments will be made for which we would like to receive subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Song Club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years he still enjoys singing with the probably more than a sweet choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his commitment to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral representative on behalf of the Cecilian Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in usual tracks: With the MGV Bettera, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music club, the full-maringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which had around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, her Brothers".
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for the honor of a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Beta also sang classical choral songs such as "huntering" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and group of women - the "impulsor" - the song wreath of saltstones, the song wreath of saltstones ensured the women's share of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulse" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home again with "What Isch the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" a.k.a. Hannelore Stollsteimer conducted a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy over lunch.
Children’s Dreams Come True
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the customs district receive mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the facilities in the realization of their building and beauties.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and children's cribs from the whole customs circle can participate in the action.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten site action.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest messenger, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on an (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide many hardworking construction helpers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law
'We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what does Parliament think about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow', was read in the paper which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
"The law is draconic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of the government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law "the media effectively into a stranglehold". However, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and named the design as "draconian".
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published photos of security cameras on which it was seen how the units sent to the crime scene supposedly robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this with the commissioning of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the summons was withdrawn after a riot of the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be confiscated with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy".
In addition, the paper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's description of 'living blogosphere'.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist in the nation that describes Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back into the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators have brought public trouble.
In May, they agreed to reverse the cuts made by the National Remuneration Commission and put back into force their generous salaries of about 532,000 Schillings free of tax per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for FC
The official inauguration celebration for the artificial lawn sports field was not bad for the city and the football club, despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant holiday hour probably all wished for last Saturday, but Peter did not want to join in.
Thus all those had the regrets that came without umbrellas or could not hold one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as did some speakers.
Wet was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who contributed.
Here is especially Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restless pensioners moved 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also honoured by Karl Rombach, a member of the Landtag.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, district chairman of the Southbad football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn site so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first thoughts about solving the problem when it was intended to build a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school on Lake Salinense.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the construction of an artificial lawn sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpaht, agreed to a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the Municipal Council decided to transfer the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarising Klumpp.
The beginning of the construction of the artificial lawn was on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike line.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Amongst other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentarianism and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the coercion of immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union refuses a double pass.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda of the session on Friday, the SPD confirmed its no toll for a car requested by the CSU.
A vignette was a "flatrate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive", said Florian Pronold, SPD negotiator for transport in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of anomalies on rural roads, which were already the focus of the accident.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be a first step from Pronold's point of view.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not really the question on Friday evening at the outdoor stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Motorists seriously injured in an accident
In the event of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was severely injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way to Grefrath at 9:15 p.m. with her car on the Kempener Austring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, she overlooked the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The train collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blockage after an accident at the schänzlekreisel
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left track of the two-track Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left turn track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
The BMW of a 23-year-old constituent collided with the BMW.
Also damaged was the VW passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
In total, about 15,000 property damage occurred, and the police reported it.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport creates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Persuasion like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat airport in the future.
Most of the speakers' announcements thus fall away - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cancellation of persuasion affecting individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
By the deletion of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers will be made on one day - it will be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual passages have been perceived relatively little, but at the same time all the other information about changed flights or departure times are going a bit down here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to braking with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander-Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swedishly hooked on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree trunks, hoofs and water buckets.
The tree trunk is four and a half metres long and weighs between 25 and 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't go far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown off vertically, should skip once and then come to the lying.
This is assessed by most points.
The target accuracy of the hoof throw depends on the target.
From eight meters away is thrown onto a pflock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two of each "Clan" or team are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and single competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the contestants can join in the scotch skirt.
But Swabian costumes are also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can sign up until one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander-Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the property on Saturday.
In the evening, the band's fans come at their expense.
At 19 o'clock the Biraböhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg forms the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays cool Polkas and fairy tales.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a rich big band sound.
With it will be Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron from hamlets among the vines.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzuft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for the morning shovel, from 2 p.m. on the farm chapel Buffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
On Friday, the Stopelacker Party with DJ Ralf will be open.
Other program items include the Oldtimer and Towing Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the craftsman's market and sheep shearing.
Specially for children there is a petting zoo, straw-hüpfburg, tractor ride (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the Förderverein Multipurpose Halle, the Ski Club and the Traktorfreunde "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quartz set.
The Vegetarian League is also called World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Federation proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine was a good alternative to butter, yogurt replace by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Postageable plant cream replaces conventional whiting.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of ground flax seeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Relaxers become dough instead of egg, for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silkentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people currently feed on vegans in Germany, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to her host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached by foot.
Here already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening light is a special attraction.
Due to the shift in time, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The City does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
After that, it was about the financial center of Wall Street at the Memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high view platform of the Empire-State-Building.
After that, it was through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and experience school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name day of Saint Hubertus, a Hubertus fair is celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the Jagdreiter Westphalia under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musices on Parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) after old, original French melodies.
The winders wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dogs on tow hunting musically.
The festive fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexicon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name at Opschlag in the district city of Kleve in scope to the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: to make an actual stay not only thoughtful, but always experience it again and again.
Because it's just fun and just nice.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café-ambient looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team pampers the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually filled fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at Opschlag as a host: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university as well.
"We do not have a specific target group," emphasises Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all ages between them.
Speaking of Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic husband and wife are behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most diverse variations themselves.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette -- that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the night of the Ringelnatz.
"Nice, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an outstanding fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always only address those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the normal operation as little as possible".
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as to the team and the beautiful surroundings at the top in Kleve.
The street, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the delight of many cleverers, the guests from close by and far and the students who discover the Gastromeile and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious collaboration entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Stiftungfestival is always the appropriate festivity to perform honours.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was celebrated this time by author Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also made some rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
This year the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of an activity bouquet went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
==References====External links==
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club manager Ange Pier-Ribert, who once again had enchanted an extra-class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets on his regular choir rehearsals on Tuesday at 7:45 p.m.
"New vocal voices are welcome to us at any time," Schlotmann said.
UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the run-up to "sustainable development goals", which are to replace the Millennium Goals ending in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden have been without victory for four days, the handball-Oberligist still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know what a victory tastes like," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon is in advance warning the index finger.
I have trained many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait for reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
To finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the past performances.
Before all things in the cover work and in the switch game, it was really hard at last.
Chance-taking also has to be definitely better.
That's why I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the quantity on the place of independence of the capital.
For almost two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, which was initially supported by White-ruled Rhodes and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stocks in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high castle of Renamos on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, declared Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to put down concerns about instability.
In contrast to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a 'loser' who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words, Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement.
In contrast to FT, he stated that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of the tensions that have been fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have here two grown men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide with the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a crippling movement to obtain concessions and financial advantages from the government.
Renamos' electoral success has declined since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democratico de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has committed unrestrained attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already worried about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that they should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said that people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and useful roads again," he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as 'models for life', says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic", children would be "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "suffering".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immense sense of good and evil.
This must be understated, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement seat in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short play of the scene.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much approval under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and overcrowded leaps of time from youth to nearby retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his children's heaven, in his courtyard.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht he led by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-spin and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, but also his sister, Philippines, welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music between the individual game scenes and finished the performance.
For the award of honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler was honoured, who, in representation of the then official Hättich and part of the city council, was waiting for him.
Her expectation then made the three-king singers who led Hansjakob to the cry: "Ah, how beautiful, there are again childhood memories of my own three-king time."
With their song "O Jesselin" they enjoyed the audience in the open court as well as the stork day children with their shout "Out, Out".
His criticism of the Amtskirche had at that time expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and many praiseworthy words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Hope of Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sportingly descending Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketballers have increased.
If there is a Wildcard procedure, there is now a competitor for the Neckar giants.
The Hamburg Towers Basketball Project does not have an application for a possible successor.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
However, a first breath could not be heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure so long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Up until May 23rd, Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove its economical Bundesliga suitability.
Up to now, however, the license has been refused twice to the Rhine countries.
The Arbitration Court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church takes a look
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicated to the last of its public guided tours on Sunday, October 27th, the Evening Meal Church.
After the visit of the Atomic Cellar Museum, Haigerlocher was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point of the event is a visit to the Church of the Lords.
There, the leaders are told the story of the building of the church and gain insights into the development of the Evangelical community in one through and through the Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal paintings created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller Museum.
There are maps at the box of the Atomic Basement Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum business.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, calling on non-described circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved in an intergovernmental way, it was said.
An exit of Snowden from Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany was ally of the USA, snowden threatened delivery there, it continued
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams fought for the winning title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the last match was decided by the Maier/Bronner team.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun at the tennis game was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Simpler leads the tournament
The tournament lead was in the tried and tested hands of Anja Simplechter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were in the same spot with Michael Klipsel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Kliptel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltreicher team.
The successful sound of the tournament took place in the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous participations and events.
"Great and small can learn different old crafts on both days," says the press release.
Whether soap is made, candles are turned, felt or ropes are made, for every age the matching is included.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as push cart races or stilt races.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour through the museum on Saturday and on Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock each.
On a trekking walk, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or yet lie.
In addition, visitors have a special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward on Sunday to the clown Otsch, who drives his Schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m. on.
At the same time, Hermann Büttner is pleasant and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
On both days of the event you can also see numerous artisans, such as the beesbinder, the handmaiden, the spider, the weaver and the baker in their traditional work over the shoulder.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum await a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered to be an adorable cow, because he made the decision to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart failure, Burt is not to be removed from his dream.
With his savings, single donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Peepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies among other things on wind turbines logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the campground in front of the dike.
Two huge blue hold shakers and backloaders distribute or charge the coal here as required.
Every movement of the transducers sounds a shrill sound over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the event of unfavorable wind, this is far from being heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it was now time to keep the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep platform form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can long be completed here.
"This year, we want to break the 3-million-ton mark at the envelope," Schrell said.
In addition to the on-site Eon power plant, the imported coal goes to domestic power plants.
If the GDF Suez power plant were to go to the grid, more than 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year would be realistic.
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the EuroLeague could not reduce the enormous optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," commented Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European king class the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn the piece of art into a guided tour 13 minutes before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We have fought back incredibly against the two-time EuroLeague Champion, but then again have made a rash mistake," said Yassin Idbihi, Bayern pro.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful shipyards of the Munichers, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, variete artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as was the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution of Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known for playing in a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefice event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the lineup both at Saturday Night Live and at Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Krull as well as Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, Rassenthemen-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the biggest visitors of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a reputable television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will be satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN vetomists and Germany.
"After years we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last few years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jzawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Boards With Machete
Two children committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go hunting birds with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they caught the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in front of their homes in a working quarter.
The body was found in the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-nurse of the disciple they had taken with her was supposed to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described before the police the Tathergang without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder mentioned a rivalry in football games among others.
He was transferred to a psychiatric youth institution for the time being.
She's got to go to jail.
Because of exploitive human trafficking, detention, threat, insult and dangerous physical injury, the Konstanz District Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession in the context of a trial agreement.
He then met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the bar after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the revenues of the women who had been buying for him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he hindered women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenue.
Before the court, the defendant first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed serious doubts about the psychological restriction and therefore a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after a first call by telephone monitoring measures.
The overheard conversations had been marked by a high degree of aggression.
In later hearings the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, who had discovered blue spots all over the body, had not made a statement to this day.
It is about "a totally broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He has separated himself from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after being imprisoned," he said.
Oil price continues to reach USD 96 per barrel
The oil price fell further on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The December reference crude oil for deliveries in Europe in the late morning was dropped in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange at USD 14 cent to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell at 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has been straining prices over the past few weeks.
The US Department of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there were indications of increased demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This suggests a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Crude oil of the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, which is also used by American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-frisk directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had called for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("Anhalt and Search") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until the city's appeal was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city was in violation of the constitution by the way the program for the arrest and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies provided, including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to assist the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday, the appeal court heard the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyism; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the Court's criticism.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they in an inappropriate way targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and supervision, and assigned a pilot programme with on-board cameras in areas where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were released after police control.
An oral hearing on the vocation of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg has increased to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of which are black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all the minorities filed a lawsuit that developed into a collective lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opposers believe that the changes would dampen the morals of the police, but not the crime; nor would money be wasted and the wider problem of a police who were under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-free practices, which were constitutional, but merely reformed the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD.
Of the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the talks, images of the inserts were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former German border defence vehicle.
Rainer Prevo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning, according to Herne, to take up an advisory role at the association.
In 2008 the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created in the record period of just under a week the sick station in Socogim, a wretched neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
She also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized away in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, for example, Acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medications, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
Nor should it be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It was not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a wrong tip about an affair between Charles Clarke, Minister of the Interior.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The paper instructed Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
"In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the editor of the Emergency Service, is no one standing in front of the home of people and hoping to catch it on a fresh note, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate histories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He argues, but we say, "And whether he knew about it."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editor of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voice mails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the research ran, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities with this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former interior minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had an affair with a married woman when he himself suffered from Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned Reich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
Although President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations on Thursday at the Élysée-Palast in Paris, he also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to relinquish the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The days of play between 29 November and 2 December in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus excluded.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in planning early," said Mayor Jens Häußler, who opened the Civil Information Event on the flood protection concept in Gehingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the measures planned, to ask questions, to express concerns and to submit ideas.
Häussler made it clear: "The final decisions are taken by the members of the Municipal Council".
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on 15 May 2009 was an incisive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, says Hüßler.
A river basin survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gehingen.
"The goal is to protect as many built-up plots as possible," says Häußler.
The design of the protection against a flood can be expected every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In specialist circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gehingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, around four million euros need to be invested in Gehingen, where the municipality can count on around 70 percent of national grants.
Häussler pointed out, however, that there is only one way to promote a comprehensive approach.
The community was dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and authorisation procedure had to be completed.
In the best case, implementation could start in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the Municipal Council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to submit their requests.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the responsible engineering office Wald and Corbe from Höllsheim, who introduced the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in sum.
In addition, one would have to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Disgusting prevailed in the bedside of the old town, which, even in the case of normal thunderstorms, suffers from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, Mr Häussler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events can be implemented.
Larger dimensioning of wastewater canals would devour millions.
Severely injured after impact
On the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police locked the street completely immediately, but at first they could not say much about the accident.
However, there are several testimonies that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old steering wheel of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavy that the fire department needed about half an hour to free her from the wreckage.
The real cause of the accident initially remained unexplained.
Both accidents occurred in nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relationship in the outside: the stabbing eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski can be understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing house, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security guard and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minerheiten-Report" dates back to 1956, pouring out the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribute.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", i.e. what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is like ours terrifyingly, mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a penal camp full of Pesudo criminals."
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story acts like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's hearing noise.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice work.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the monitor himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Takes mistakes and sacrifices not only in purchase but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says to keep getting closer to the truth.
Proclaiming about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy business of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Procuratorate could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the agency reported Interfax.
Previously, Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce company paranoia due to state supervision
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep across the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of Constitution and the Prevention of Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Secret Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the United States did not use foreign espionage opportunities to "storage the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became Whistleblower, began publishing his full-horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure if they can speak to the Director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The barrel to overflow led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been wired, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come to the fore, then certainly corporate management are also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China is when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, there was no evidence in Snowden's documents that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything, except for the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical refinement of the U.S. spying authorities exposed by the snowden revelations shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spying risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about US data mining activities with prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers who didn't exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that these will stay physically in this legal area?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is not a surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we are, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management does not normally boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, as this brings benefits to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been convinced that taking a free USB stick on a trade fair or the unguarded laying of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, so to speak.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the board at Audi car manufacturer, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," warns BVT in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: "The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies."
Hechingen: trade fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can make," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special trade fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept in motion again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the frequently dressed and embroidered clothes, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a tow.
Since, however, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house dress miller.
In men the suit dominates with vest and plastic, but also cream-coloured or brown combinations can be chosen.
It was explained that the selection of the venue was important.
Jewelryless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the memo.
If you want to drive with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"Cutting, however, is also popular for young women's goodbyes," he says.
Romance is also needed for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. photo series in special places, preferably waterfalls, some days after the feast, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable feast.
Dog Friends Successful
Repeatedly, the athletes of the dog-friend bitz were successful on a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to place 87 points at 12th place.
Susi Höpp took a critical look at the performance judge with her Woody in Class 1.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ringer mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in an upright mat standing behind the stage in the school gym.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family is in doubt.
"They are convinced that their son has been murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You would never have believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic, that there is a violation of the laws of physics as well as of the common sense," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unsolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a "positional suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities release all surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children at schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the US government, as the number of school-leaving children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy.
According to CDC, the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine in stock – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to respond to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrine more readily in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels as if something is pushing on my tongue", "My tongue feels as if a hair is on it" or "My tongue is scratching".
Parents of intersexual children can choose 'gender indeterminate'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with undistinguished genitals.
Newborns are no longer allocated rigidly to male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain gender for such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for a sex assignment in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children comes to the world every year as neither a boy nor a girl.
They belong to the intersexual, a group that is diagnosed as "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (egg sticks or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise to use the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not to wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for an operation.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but this is not true for most children," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that makes people homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related but is based on their biological constitution, which is neither male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hairiness, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Not with the gender image matching boys now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or 'third sex'.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court had granted lifelong maintenance of an "undetermined" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersexuals, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also ruled against the German law, stating: "If the world is torn into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were given a gender at birth.
"Early life is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said on the parents website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sexes were called Hermaphrodides, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered gender to be something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being called into question, after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
"In the middle of the 20th century it was called a "psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unexplained genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was formal.
He shaped the term "sexual identity" and argued social and environmental insults – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered himself to be male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a spoiled circumcision, to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he returned to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations came to the public, who are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana author who was born with XY male chromosomes, but with ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to the male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
The surgery has made him infertile.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could "encourage stamping and stigmatisation".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to ‘not set’ the child,” she said.
We're afraid that's a favor to intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children to do so.
When they are grown up, they can decide their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law "authorises" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgenic resistance.
Because of the recipe defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the Child Psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate.
"The law gives parents room to make decisions that don't have to be overrun," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and to clarify things and thus gives them time before they write 'male' or 'female'.
In this way everything is all right – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be undone anymore.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that fits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decision.
Unknown hurt girl by shooting from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in gunshots from a car.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
That's what the police in Burg told me.
The girl was easily injured on the left bank.
Rescue forces took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disk broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out it was called Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to be egged children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the Eierste immediately, no damage to property would have arisen either.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were probably also lit in the city area, but no damage was caused here.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel blinds were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man had invented his wheel blinds in the immediate vicinity all of them again, which is why the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives in a dream.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" Waltraud Ries asked, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern not to be able to cope with the many stairs to the house and the apartment at an age, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with disability.
Just recently a book of hers has been published on the subject of 'Happy Living at Age - Which Type of Living Is the Best for Me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what isn't going at all', she begins to tell.
When she moved with her husband to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today with mid-fifty Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the subject of 'living at age'.
Most of them will displace it as long as it goes.
Always become only the others', she says smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can you think.
'Then it can be too late, too,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living at age.
'What form of living one chooses, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
It is not a solution for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language one also combines in the Dolce Vita,' gives the technical book author the willingness to relocate.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At age, everyone has his ticks and Macken
'For me, a living room would be nothing', she says, with a wink of eyes.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age, you just need your retreat rooms, too,' says Ries.
Nevertheless, the author of the book does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residence community can still work.
But this had to go differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest too,' she believes.
With this view, at least she is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay as long as it goes in their own apartment', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civic service life at the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people on the topic of becoming older.
Therefore, even older people would often also take inconvenientities and restrictions to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the foundation Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those concerned with the alteration of their home or their apartment to inform themselves thoroughly first and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the apartment you can realize one or the other, and if it's only the toilet seat, the interior architect clears up.
But not always can the existing apartment be remodeled age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Even though you could install a staircase inside the apartment, which would also be paved road to the front door with stairs, but the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it digs her more than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He would continue to be accused of having disallowed secret information.
So he had to go to the United States for criminal proceedings, said the U.S. Secretary of State Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that either.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to continue threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was a parliamentarian's opinion, not a German member of the government.
Secret Service Coverer Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA member of staff sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded it to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
After a translation by Ströbele, the letter reads as follows:
To the responsible
I've been asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my work in these institutions, I became witness to systematic violations of law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent rage that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have assessed the revelations to a system of universal surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations led to many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously concealed abuse of public confidence.
The benefits to society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in the purchase have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been shown to be positive, my government continues to treat Disnans as a fidelity and strives to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
Yet, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will take this debilitating stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts with regard to the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, adequately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterlingen.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at an "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to stand up for the entertainment of the house, like to heat, to look at the garden and to clear the way.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisbach gives a concert place on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, presents the musical pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician's shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the book that will be published shortly and reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had carried out "extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011" in order to find out whether Obama's dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he dropped.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times National Political Correspondent, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House staff, including the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the survey values of the former foreign minister Clinton to exchange for the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama’s, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of his efforts to exchange bids despite his 'close personal relationship' before he finally decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would 'not significantly improve Obama's chances'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," explained Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigations "careful", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move was paying off in respect of the polls.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was "conscious", the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing from the investigations about whether to drop bids in the elections.
"Possible," Martin replied.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service, similar to that of conventional mail?
In designing the early Internet services, communication was a priority.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in creating a stable foundation for an listen-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user sends an e-mail to "Benni", are the two computers directly connected?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the e-mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the web?
Most mails are read on the go multiple times by software robots.
In the case of the sender's provider, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an e-mail is extremely low.
But theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With high technical effort it is also possible to mask the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with who without further notice.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the most privately used mailboxes, according to a August 2013 study by Consvios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo mail had fallen last, GMail from Google was able to expand significantly.
Mother in the forest is getting worse and pension is paying
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still collected their pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pension and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First, he disguised the death of the 89-year-olds, then he dropped in the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man then hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: At that time it became apparent that no medication was needed for the nursing mother.
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because of the strangeness of the officials, they continued to determine.
It turned out that for more than 15 years the two had lived in a common home and he had been tending it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, an autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a glowing leaching from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research on qualls and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thus raising the pH in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We've been testing it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jelly lamp is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental Bristol based company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and on itself impossible because of the light cracking, which is caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I guess we find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still in the handball league after six days of play without any point.
Calculated now for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow comes to Derby against the TSV Daverden who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers shows himself to be optimistic.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has at his disposal his complete cadre.
Daverten also puts us on tempo.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has left nothing but a safe impression at last.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because everything can happen in Derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to drop down in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Jugliche Joost Windsüß, who is active with double play rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
He who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more like a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not declared my willingness to distribute from my home sweets, and will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween then is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year exciting unlived objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone with them to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not prying.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lucerne, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Department of Commerce, who travel through the neighborhood with the saying "sweet or sour".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't mind – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of confectionery manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spits.
They have great names such as 'Terror Behind the Walls' (which, by the way, is in a real prison), 'Howl-O-Scream' and 'The House of Shock'.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that earn $500 million of revenue, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pee in your pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and one of the guy you're standing on leaves a comment like 'next facial expression'.
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we have put on from a small age.
Fortunately, the baby in pumpkin's trend only started last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice out of their 921 kilos of heavy pumpkin.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains charred body
The fire department had to move out in Helmrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the Hof district captures fire at night for Friday.
The rescuers are storing a charred body from the house.
Rescue forces have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesperson in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents had not been at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to advertise for the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover expects that the number of its current pastors will halve by 2030 after the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the course of work and the day itself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche first commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people for theology study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after abitur.
Burfien takes this back to the process of ecclesialization: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and I can focus on where I am concerned.
Pastors could be very close to people as a pastor.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This is true of young people today who are concerned not only with their careers but also with their work.
According to the Landeskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from bowler workers mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new ones for the rigors and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge chariots – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a day of training and testing in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called for the rescue of a dog trapped 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a quarry
Cocker spaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her dismal position
Firefighters sailed off a rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to secure a dog that was trapped in a rock wall on a 15 - meter - high protrusion.
The nine-month-old Cockerpaniel-Hündin Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the firefighters of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published help calls on social networks when she escaped the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the spot and sailed for the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen stiffly.
But now she's fine.
After that, she ate a few dog kitchens.
That was a rather unusual effort.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the vet's office, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Seeing salvation was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep them back in their arms.
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never hired Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said that she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker at night, and that "he hung me when I was 18".
She added: "It was a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: 'Maybe she confused him with someone else.'
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on 1st place this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives the Scotsman the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would result in more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not, as expected, matter in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has come so far that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport controls" ducks at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, drawn up after the war, has come to its end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party has been able to hold nearly five million votes for Germany – just founded this year – in the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by maintaining the single currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to let them do so.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe can be found with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – inspired by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are behind a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All world wage-fixing regulations do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimisation, and Europe has repressed its own economic policy, with which to fight the defeated French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus the ruling socialists have assigned third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters' votes – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newly won popularity among the working class white Frenchmen?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will be joined together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (superior) Nations', the General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Klein-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I believe that Scotland could drive very well in a more relaxed European federation, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider equalising Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkablely – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to answer.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to opt for independence only to have austerity policies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical changes do not yet mean puberty directly
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children's Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming down parents – this is usually not a sign that puberty is now rapidly entering," Kaplowitz explained.
Clear indications of the development, such as growing breasts, shame and shoulder hairs and body smell, are shown in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarches (occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to become a menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty for girls: the essential adviser on dealing with this frequently occurring problem".
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is 'frozen' when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift before age eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
If progress is made faster, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods to delay an early menstrual period and to ward off another episode: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is hesitant about drugs, but he admits: “Repressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and feelings of girls, unlike their peers. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days with ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories on the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be the cause.
Boys come into puberty like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine years who have a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have grown the facial and puberty hair before, the trend towards a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the subject.
The emergence of acne and pubic hair is common even to babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician as they should speak to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than intended.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute over seat width in the face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been an argument about the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width that passengers are offered in the tourist class on long flights – not always the ones that airlines are trying to do the most, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
This week, Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US erzrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance pilots, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear part of the aircraft, in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats, is crucial for the economic results indicated for the new "Mini Jumbo" design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" accommodates 406 people in the tourist class who are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transporters 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hiebe about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Airbus now appeals to the public directly before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed investors an image in which three people collided in a restaurant and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
Because of changed dietary habits, people get thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Ministry of Health.
According to U.S. health statistics, the male average American waistline in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says his rival adhered to a 1950s seat concept when the average body circumference of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out which proved that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests Airbus' seat dimensions figures and says that it is not in the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between air fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the aircraft experience depends on more than the seating width.
"It is really a matter of giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful," explains the aircraft cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly a topic that can affect turnover.
The debate is behind a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER.
The results of Boeing are partly dependent on the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in the cost per unit is still lower than for machines currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive in our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper air fares.
"eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin facility, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide jet sellers even contribute to measuring the equipment in competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10-seater rows, but has not yet sold one according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats at the corridors for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be puffed up, but could be diverted from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the Garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further tests are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
"We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which means that a smoker does not experience any nicotine elevation.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time off", the researchers explained that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely, smokers would use him to quit.
"They then know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to lose the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obed
Against the former minister of the Joe Tripodi Labor Party from New South Wales, an investigation will be initiated by the state corruption commission.
The former NSW Minister denies that he has amended the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations into whether Obed has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeds run two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the plots after Tripodi's former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had declared accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer running times.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought in the Obeds annually 2.5 million dollars, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was the Harbour Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he disagreed to have made the changes at the request of Obed, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had insisted on reforming the government's lease arrangements.
One of the ICAC’s phone records showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obed, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had been transferred to the Harbour Ministry after working in the Fisheries Authority under Obed.
'Where the topic discussed in this telephone conversation is the preparation of commercial leasing arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
'No', Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter aircraft attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighters had attacked a target on Thursday night in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a leading government officer to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, this was the goal of Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be tested for authenticity
The government is thinking about an 'equity test' for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, he would use a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for the entry of family and friends into Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former member of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered insulting by Australia's neighbours.
“Loud declarations such as ‘foreigners are supposed to hire themselves back’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region embellish an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister for Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the 'truth criterion' is taken over, a person applying for a visa could be checked to see whether 'the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company.'
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after hundreds of companies, who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, have finally ceased.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumant probably died of a heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia is cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since the death of his father on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The UK government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed that high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England should be established as early as Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The UK Government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for the use of 'indisputable' for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link holds the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to explore options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, create the benefits for everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must also continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the USA to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, view or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books when they take off and land.
However, Australian companies do not follow direct plans to amend their regulations, which require US airlines to implement innumerable amounts of work.
The CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight phases in Australia.
"The CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in aircraft", has been explained.
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already conducted talks with the CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explains that it is open to change, but this should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas stated that the current rules would remain the same.
"Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and will certainly look at the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision has different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference caused by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA announced.
In rare cases with poor visibility the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment while landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB fans with light rockets had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic, which was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
On the other hand, where the most loyal and loudest of the BVB fans stand, the southern stage initially presented itself in a very quiet manner: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise co-ordinates the joint ignition, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stage, a big flag with the inscription "Stedium Ban" was waved lonely.
Only as a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always entered the place as the first BVB player, soon cheered up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and wailing scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the South Tribune, nothing moved.
Also that stadium spokesperson Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not ensure celebration.
Only five minutes before the tap, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that was held by hands up to that time was unleashed in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the racks in the stadium.
As the last one, as always, was the southern stage on the row - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derby winner gets up" came from the South Tribune, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately in front of Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB-trailers had light rockets fired into the crowds and into the place - and almost hit Torschüter Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words were a rather tiresome appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," announced the BVB boss at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I've forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras were shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose sanctions by the end of next week.
"That's gonna be intrusive," Watzke assured.
You can be excited about how the reactions on the South are going to turn out.
Pfandhäuser booming in Singapore because the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirtheula exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, and there's all my money in it," says Amirtelufa.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee and also works for her husband, she does not have enough monthly family income, she explains.
Indeed, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where the debt of households is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where she made her exchange, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Engagement of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthelinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawn houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
Pfandhäuser, however, offers the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are faster than banks are possible.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pfandhäuser after families feel pressured by rising cost of living and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a relaxed fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium incomes are looking for pfandhäuser to compensate for the difference in the case of a stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency designated Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly through increasing mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency considers that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list at 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economicists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has barely come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segments (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 pawn houses of the City State of Gold.
People say: 'The gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandmother's gold chain and get back next month'.
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pawn business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, not only wants to expand to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took with the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some lenders were in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawn houses not only fined cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items that they already own and the leaching of personal valuables does not increase domestic training," she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, secured financing.
Neither are all people who use mortgage loans in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small companies who have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Explorer Edward Snowden has in principle an interest in helping Germany in clarifying the ever-brissing NSA spying business.
Following the presentation of Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Federal Party, in his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the ex-secretarial staff would testify in a German prosecutor's office or in a committee of inquiry.
Snowden pointed to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is based on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take 'immediate measures' to prevent a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has prepared an emergency rescue package which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325-million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars of emergency assistance for election services.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and treatment for grey star, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day-care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of the clinic staff I've been told they're the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister had a strict duty of reporting and accountability by the Tasmanian Government.
The state had to maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Mr Wilkie said today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path."
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state off the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman for the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "pasture solution".
"We are therefore in today's situation because the Labor Government has deducted 430 million dollars from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government almost rips half a billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also heavier than necessary.
The plot played in France in the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination with another.
The film never slips away in audacity or a passion for sensation – and that's his problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes him a tormenting Büßer shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, such as a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition production facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group on Thursday explained, while in the north of the country there were serious clashes near one of the sites where toxic substances are thought to be being stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, set up in The Hague by Damascus to destroy or "inoperable" all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which essentially represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fighting took place in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits here, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Great Britain, announced.
On Thursday, the group of activists following the death toll of a network of activists in Syria stated that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN has estimated the number of dead in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The battles underline the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed to, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous weapons arsenal is a race against the time of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team was “now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria."
Therefore, "there are currently no further inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites listed by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions would not have been possible, said the inspectors.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been “disbanded ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme there had been transferred to other named facilities that were inspected”.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons to be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
"I'm taking care of the bravery and courage you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a division of Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger About Judgment for Bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 in Bali during the bombing raid reacted in anger at the verdict for the last of the instigators who were brought before the court, as Umar Patek felt that they should be shot in the ground.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building bombers for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years of imprisonment.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A plea of guilt was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it was for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also called a 'Demolition Man', who could have applied for a death penalty.
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his coconspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have another granddaughter and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 23:00 on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had an explosively filled backpack exploded.
He fell into the coma and "dead" three times after the attack, while he was on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Actually, this guy was supposed to get the death penalty in front of everyone else.
Letting him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and hurting many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to face trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had given the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't sit down," said Corteen.
Until recently he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has caused to other people.
The verdict was made before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which is celebrated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile conversations)
From departure to landing, travelers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the image of films, but not with their mobile phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aeroplanes comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment stowage regulations in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers currently need to switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not restart them until the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, passengers must turn them off again and must not restart until the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when taking off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA stated.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional airline association, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it," said Glading.
To be honest, we are sorry to have to feel like custodians on this issue.
However, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a American Airlines jet in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the airstrip.
And heavier devices like laptops still need to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may ban certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said about the National Transport Safety Board, safety expert on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Handy is really a problem, not only because it could cause potential interference with navigation equipment, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitters," says Rosenker.
A Industry Advisory Committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government authorise a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, there is talk of up to a third of passengers forgetting or ignoring the device's shut-off.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment by passengers had become known by VHF radios that were the latest technology trend at that time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not constitute electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines, says Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-reader emits only minimal radiation when you turn over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the proponents of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but no one could find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he felt that the interference with the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke through the devices to disrupt aircraft systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the FAA recommended that pilots allow the equipment to be switched off by passengers in the event of an instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by Air Rescue Service of North Sea-Bohr Island Rescued Bird
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea bore island, was released into the wild again.
The water ralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was spotted by the Scottish animal protection organisation SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: "This water rallie was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drill island.
He added: 'He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help.'
On their release, the water ralle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in Britain want to change our relations with the EU for prosperity and work.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while the countries of the EU are stagnating.
They wish that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be favored by the government, instead of stopping with the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscured EU institutions.
In her opinion, the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be restored to Westminster, from antitrust to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market, as, according to the companies, the costs of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most saying, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "senseful change" that brings the book of action back to the UK.
It is a matter of much – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the UK conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary, as the euro zone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means that companies are more focused on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the Gazprom Board of Directors.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream-Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of the Board of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to increase diversity in Russia's export routes across Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and his counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard officially.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "always" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project comes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other secondary countries should start on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate site in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock market newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, as German commercial property was sought, the view of the volume of the transaction was reflected.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year's average.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.

Hearing in front of the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of sexual crimes against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual crimes related to children before 2011 with accusations against Child Care Officer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that "there had never been an incident of sexual abuse in the organization".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been accused of child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of the abuse of trusted children.
Hare told Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening of the YMCA to the Commission had also been inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external audits of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the front in the field of child safety".
On the contrary, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest possible assessment of four in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed "from me down" at Lord's appointment and did not ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report breaches of the child safety directives.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA for sexual assault on twelve boys at the beginning of the year during his two-year job.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that kept employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, that she was privately cared for as a babysitter, had her sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child caretaker Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very improbable”.
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have trusted to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported it.
Hare stated that he had communicated his view to the board of directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord case” was not "not to report" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred had been made by the YMCA Children's Services Manager, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what had been 'overly' and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-resistant organization when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in recruiting, reviewing, incorporating, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20th.
Tony Blair stated that he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Quartet of Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard in London as saying: 'Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ...'
When the horse show experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to drive the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was coming.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in kindergarten and did his first steps only a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trod through the three laps and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both the same size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a jagged angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony who were far above his age.
And Toffee received the best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland Pony since every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to fight the entire field of participants and have gone out of the place with Goldpokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time that he had competed with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and slapped him."
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won't take long until he's on the horse of the year – and I'm sure he'll cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they're a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the screening ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Führer – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes helped her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper is to be reformed after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page, said a press regulator was to be reformed.
The New Express based in Guangzhou had a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribery money to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
The new expression will now be subject to a 'comprehensive rectification', the regulatory authority explained.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on Zoomlion’s listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it had been decided to "apply an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license."
In addition, “Yangcheng Evening News Group had been instructed to perform a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant managers be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express management team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the paper published two calls for his release on the front page and sat behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he said to CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized I was acting wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page and stated that it had failed to check the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-inch tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, making it easier to hide loaded with drugs trucks.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported undetected, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the Court's records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set up an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartel with the challenge of quickly bringing its product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640-metre long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
But in an interview Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved himself, emphasized the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs considerably from that.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong edamer, these sluts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the meat and fish waiver, the vegan leaves away from all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains may be asked, but when considered in more detail, the vegan diet is characterized by considerable ingenuity.
"Broot spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander vegan lives, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "I changed my diet in 1997 and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers to wear normal leather.
He realized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," says Proctor, the vegan maxim, which extends to the entire consumer behaviour.
Instead of grieving after burgers, stirrers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, which increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan doesn't give up, it's not an ash, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the conversion of food, you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor rather leads back to the power of habit.
And these very conditionings also failed some still so well-meaning attempts.
"The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And apply: "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it is intended to taste thoroughly once and for all.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just reducing on animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed on vegan.
"My blood levels are good, I'm often checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the cold store."
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor would not have to go far enough for food procurement.
Finally, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Anything I need, I'll find on the spot.
I just buy something special from time to time.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is known for "ordinary" finished products as well."
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes would be far more favourable and less time consuming than was generally accepted.
"There is a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knives you can do well if you don't get some better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has a new role to play when cooking together.
"The situations that can arise from this are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to be enslaved.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem to be as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many donner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just ordered a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealanders can find out a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demand comes, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the kitchen in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the very largest part impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, if one learns to understand that can also contain animal additives in peanuts as colouring agents, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the application of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
Not only did Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen write a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explain the many ingredients that food and cleaning products are used.
"Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stop or trip," says Proctor.
Veganism, he is an important moral fingertip that affects consciousness.
He may not quite manage to put his habits away, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathing.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger boilers at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year alone there had been two foreheads in one week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the United States came to rest on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours because of a computer pan.
In addition, last year the Facebook stock exchange tour had taken care of attendance.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the stock exchange supervisor SEC found out and darkened the company to a record penalty of 10 million dollars.
Constance: cyclists bypass 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at around 22 o'clock, with a lady's bike was on the left footway from the railway station to the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped from a local on the walkway, the biker could no longer brake in time according to the police.
At the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15-inch long space wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police send Assange a extradition notice
The British police today handed over a extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian had a 'call to stand up' to ask him to appear in a police station and added that he should not comply with it, threatened to arrest him.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the U.S. on 19 June, he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "shalled a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen," said one speaker.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police's request.
Assange fears that he will be delivered by Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after he published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver, who had crashed with 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs, receives £1,000 penalty
A driver was imposed a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of Colchester's court, Howie confessed himself guilty, without being driven by the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay £90 and a £100 sacrifice.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London’s bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers, apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, revenue from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012/13, exceeds the proceeds for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, northwest, Yorkshire and the region of Humber.
Cook said: "After the increases in the stamp tax on high-priced dwellings and the introduction of the related legislation against dealing, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the old municipal tax system."
"However, this step could deter some foreign investors from buying properties in London or from selling them," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London South West Belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have been worth 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging 'domestic market' in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between the tail wagging of a dog and its mood.
Previous research had shown that lucky dogs with their tails were wading more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "In humans it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the left side movement and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side of their covens, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadriplegics and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the cock moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: "We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we have thus been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wading dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the cock was mostly left (again from the perspective of the dog who is betting), her heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and you have to wrestle with your tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs are turning their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a satisfied dog.
Another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, said: "Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if his "tail" is floating to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study."
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined – and dogs are no exception," Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can easily be recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys shifting performance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer has suffered from head inflammation.
The band from Sheffield should play on Friday in the Hydro.

The announcement of the band came after she had to postpone an appearance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys announced: "After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and on medical advice the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with head inflammation, which is why he is unfortunately unable to perform."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20th, which took place at the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21st.
Keep all tickets valid for these shows.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis was first appointed new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope's election – that is the case of a group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In a statement announcing the message, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistorium.
"Papst Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consistory in February so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals entitled to vote would probably have fallen by February.
He stated that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals entitled to the election again looks at 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the mission to find opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “well possible” that Francis asked the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that is all new.
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we do not know who he calls.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatrest
General Motors called back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatrest, according to a communication from the US vehicle safety regulatory authority on Friday.
For some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal directives on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
"If the vehicle is driven from the rear to the rear, it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants, so that there is an increased risk of injury," was the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks that were newly developed for the 2014 model year had increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM stated on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation screams of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He said that Obama had made commendable efforts that had been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy did not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terriblely sad book.
It is a book of which I believed it would warm me up during the turbulent second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient writings in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave a speech to breathe.
The election became a victory for the earth and news spokespersons held in order to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had 82% approval.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if being torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I gave my vote for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party political blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
However, after I had defended the Obama government to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I came to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why we allow the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose the state misbehavior.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the 'most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government'.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years have passed since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood by 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP's office is not a predictable course, as a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
In the middle of Romney was a confusing and unexplained alternative that he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope of which we had been hearing for so long.
But with the decline of Obama's approval values to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become all the harder.
It arouses in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election helpers after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back on course and follow the purpose of their business.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million of CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table as to whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes will be deleted or shortened.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in favour after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a revision of the voice counting process so that it could proceed more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system in which to move in, enter data into a computer, dial immediately, and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy would include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously".
A public office is about the public service.
"We do not seek any reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide administrative investigation into the suspected manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion changes the owner every day.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanded investigation that the scandal draws around the libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators," said the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, related persons reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now to have been retired from his current position as European leader of the Forex Spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was retired this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders was accused of any misbehavior.
The instant message group from Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation was related.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks should have agreed to deal with transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks penetrate instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in a state of turmoil that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances of speculators.
Some banks have tried to shut down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the enlarged and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks led to the fact that "you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices".
The message came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices this week after he had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is curbed," said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle property
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, says a press release.
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site is threatened to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, agreed to the beautification operation with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent with the message "We are for it" had been applied.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Her motto on the large poster was "We Are Against Bauruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day the giant project fail.
In conversation with many passers-bys in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that it would be better to implement the project of the city, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they start to resign because the city is further delaying these answers, it's called from the BI.
As you can see, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the public should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some of them seem quite frightened because of this, others feel that they are "pumple extortion attempts" at the population, says the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shields for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the Bundesliga Table Leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" turned out to be by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be forced into the category of swallow kings," he protected the two offensive swirlers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegalese became a supposed actress - which was certainly not what the TV pictures showed.
"A serious wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called Arbitrator Harkam "overreached."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game.
His German compatriot, he firmly defended: "I would have behaved the same way in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the scarf with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick voted for a Lobeshymne.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he noted.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes in the framework during the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Aside from a player, he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: the U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts struck the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of comprehensive law and also considered that the health law requirement that states should either extend the access conditions for medicine or otherwise remove all state medical promotions would be non-constitutional.
The appeals against the law had been made by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low solar intensity, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters high, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swore at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers recuperated sun chairs, others sunglasses for safety.
So far, sun-hungry had to travel by cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million kroner (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine for a few years.
Post barely emptys yet on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday learning are still on different letter boxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will soon find out that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld was emptied.
Whether Sunday is also emptied in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the request of the FDP is not answered.
The social and youth spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz Rohrenbeck, wants to work here.
Sunday learning is an important postal service right at appointment post.
"This company, despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013, is radically and unsuspectably thinned out."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the Liberals' Association, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptiness times are changed or deleted.
From the point of view of the citizen, the post office is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would also have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday learning.
Piperbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration was planning discussions with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Her party has declared itself to be privatized.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt car park fees are expected to increase sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitively expensive.
This morning, the City's Magistrate advises on a presentation by transport dean Stefan Majer (Green).
Thus, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, prices should not be raised, but the time interval between parking and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the Municipal Ordinance Assembly will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt believes that this is "not a good idea".
The parking possibility immediately before the shop was "an unestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "by far appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast Actions Overrun Hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to come against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
Although the apples stood with an experienced team on the other side of the web.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they, also due to age, could not fully cope with the fast actions of the cities of joy.
With the hard and placed picks, the patrons were extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz made over the network centre and were not in place for block defence.
Two high first movement gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all respects.
In view of this depressing and game-determining performance, the third movement was then won slightly lazy and lustlessly at the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, a much more powerful opponent will be standing on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to get through in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Palchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-hit two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and score gifts in the ball adoption; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes flawed and in some critical game scenes, the overeifer prevented the view of possible points wins.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team from Marcus Blasutto agreed on the great physical commitment and a happy commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English cottage
A group of dedicated participants met at the small Engländerhütte in Ibach for the fifth day of care in the follow-up to the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut the view into the valley was to be freed, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, described this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological considerations could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribucait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Freiburg Presidium following the welcome by the Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the touristic goal of the wide view covers itself with the aim of maintaining the now highly-growing old common meadow with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
They need these free connections to species conservation.
Tribukait said she didn't want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the past care days achieved for the future.
After these various presentations Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, and the forest trawler was ready to be called if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and care for the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view at the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köffler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own municipal works, no second mayor has yet registered.
The 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köffler from Löffingen is the only candidate to succeed the mayor Norbert Brugger who is no longer running for reasons of age.
The application deadline expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of lawsuits for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was outsourced by Nortel in the insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned jointly by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that reconciles search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which are in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was outsourced to Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google Motorola acquired mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola’s library of patents.
"Although Google failed to obtain the patent at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," says the complainant.
Rockstar demands a high amount of damages from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is intentional, the accusation.
Egypt pledges first free elected presidents
Muhammad Mursi resigns from office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was first elected president of the country and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 black robe judges of the court, who have their seat on the Nile and are imitation of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability," said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who, since its founding 84 years ago, had most often been seen as a banned organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, contrary to the presidual prank from the Mubarak era, the traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the autoconvoy could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic 'replacement wheel' of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists but all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the title.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo where he was supposed to give his address.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in respect of.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university's largest auditorium with voice voices from "The army and the people are one hand".
The University of Cairo, established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a high-rise Islamic student group in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahir Square, the birthplace of the insurrection, which led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and he promised to call back the presidential power that the military council had taken over from the head of state chased out of office.
But with the taking of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the military's will, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis' speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today on Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the morning Saturday evening it goes on with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers fell from ladders: severely injured
When a defective outside sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was severely injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heater on the outside facade of a inn.
As he stepped on the ladder attached to the roof ladder, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Violent in South Africa: Twice Lifelong Prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice his life on Friday.
This was reported by the satellite transmitter SABC.
The victim died later from the consequences of serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The deed had caused horror throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Boysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young was so horrific that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar at night with booysen during the trial.
He also confessed to having beaten her and raped her, but he fought to be responsible for the girl’s death.
The police had first gone out of custody of several perpetrators, but two suspects were released because the evidence was not enough against them.
During the trial, the prosecutor also stressed that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape in South Africa is almost commonplace: every year there are about 64 000 advertisements for sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than in South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures of sexual violence but 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" visited the Pro7-Star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig owls, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel does he come into the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands before he can reach the micro.
Jumbo for strengthening at quick snacks in Waldshut
"Here I am worked with red quantities," the TV makers, black forests of ham as a mass product, amaze me.
16,000 cows a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the flesh, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
The level of private television in pure culture is presented here.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The viewer sees that disintegration of the coils is still manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bone in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire Jumbo optically reminds us of a "subboat".
The trick: Tanning branches provide the special taste of the black forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will allow all those involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the 2011/12 period.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track for record years' revenue before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest beneficiaries.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which offsets a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the weaker first half of the season, so that a profit is expected for the third year in a row for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents yesterday to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are being held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
In the examination, "unseen texts" are also used to encourage wider reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Supervisory Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new admission system and less course work.
In a speech in the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "challenger, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive math examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'problems from the right life', including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes attract
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colour strokes presents the Kreisverbandungsaufen this weekend in the Burgerhaus.
The reviews were made on Thursday
Again, the Ortsverein W514 will host this large exhibition.
Breeders of the Soest County Associations show their best animals here as well as young Wicked Hobbykeepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six price judges conducted the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors of the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The Rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 15.30 p.m., to which the award ceremony goes.
The guests are also invited to a well-stocked Tombola and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, in the Neue Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological reflections on how to deal with the last things today".
Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question in the forum of how people today grade the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much of it and had set themselves on those images of heaven and hell, "that shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection is more characterised by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been properly driven out by the religious critique," says the referent.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death".
This is linked to the question of that longing, "who dreams of everything being good in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 at Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at Wilhelms University in Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed at the firmation
In two divine services 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Seelsorgeunit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been consolidated.
In the morning, the Lauda-Si group accompanied the divine service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and gained the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had been preparing for the big holiday in recent months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race fascinates participants
In wonderful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel tells about this from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters, were also numerous everyone's cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aachen-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German championships.
Both of these were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short-range.
==References====External links==* Official website
With the ladies, theresa Duelli was the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning trophy.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie driver from Owenen came in second and third place.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years to 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute toppaths at the start.
Four riders were able to stand down from the top regional riders.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professor from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already two world champions in twelve-hour rides.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With this also Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in the Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, a eyelash came to the finish in front of the three-seat hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only a second later, the Routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall ranking.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third of the overall score.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
==History==Areane Blersch was the second place to secure Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized conduct of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote in the Top 10 for him or for one of the other heroes to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched his sick father repeatedly lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years with his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer made the decision in Bwelle to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team will start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crunches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the intervention the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the surgery and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is a strenuous pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They are drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team goes back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it creates a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a break in performance that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, says Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be involved in operations where we can help to drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated sanitary equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and instructions.
"He is without doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
Helping others to enjoy a happier life and fulfilling a promise he made to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the bone by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier, acting.
The old man, Santiago, can't do anything when it comes to fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost said that the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the young fisherman Manolo speaks, can be seen.
When Santiago sits tired of life bent on the chair, it's real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson is on stage as a soloist on long distances.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologue is not boring for a moment.
His efforts to draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made up of blue water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene into the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings Cuba's sense of life with her songs and her wonderful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests of the bar at the same time.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewer canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you won't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rise in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marveled at the two filigree church towers realize that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne's underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins with an unspectacular start: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city that was car-friendly, and therefore, from the remains of the old city walls, only what was not too big remained.
Therefore, most of the users of the car park are rushing past the Roman remains today and just turning off their car.
But who looks more closely, discovers an archaeological site separated by metal lattice bars in the Parkdeck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins made of palm stones.
"It is the remains of the Roman city walls that were built after Christ in the second half of the first century," explains Schulze.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants at the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15-metre deep shaft.
This is the well of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants get back down to the depth.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man in the north of the Alps, the prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means is that a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City Roman right and city of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult"".
And the Praetorium is the former governorial palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman sewer canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
A surprise's still got Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be seen by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will become part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which the construction work should begin shortly.
Until completion, however, some years are still to pass.
Leg almost hacked off: new edition of rocker process
After more than four years, a bloody attack in the Rocker milieu will be re-rolled.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous injury and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and were part of the bandidos at the time.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor's Office accused them of having stabbed and struck three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims were said to have been part of Hell's Angels' competing group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars had preceded.
According to the charges, it was about territory struggles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first proceedings at the beginning of 2012.
A judge then said that it could not have been proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof lifted the judgment after revision of the Public Prosecutor's Office and referred it back to the Landgericht for further proceedings.
One of the accused is currently in open custody for another offence.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the operations at night.
As a witness, the commissioner at that time was invited.
In the center were phone calls from the defendants and other people who had heard the police.
It's hard for Rocker to stick to a law that's almost always for her in court - and not pronounce.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor's Office (Oder) said on demand that there have been new traces since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the process.
The disposal company does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bends of the people on the passenger and back seat the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, some cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What's closer than to drive to the next drive-in to enjoy yourself a little bit?
I admit, I'll be happy to join you when you go to the fast food halls late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers become apparent.
Because what must you miss, that with constant regularity you throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?", I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home and until the next trash bin?
It's not just that the paperware is distorting the landscape.
Tütten have already hidden transport facilities such as guide boards and caused accidents.
But not according to what they think, probably she doesn't even know what that word actually means.
When you are on the road more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a backseat can look after festooned nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower.
There would be more or less nothing of a pair of bags - contrary to the street where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day when the cities and communities are going to have to get out of the way - and the fast food chains are going to have to demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday from his frequently repeated, clear promise: 'If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.'
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans in the last few days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said at a talk in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around on the free market for a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than predicted.
"You're coming up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was little surprising that the five percent of the population who themselves have taken out insurance would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement made by a dedicated Sebelius to an adviser behind her sitting at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the "architectist" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from a state-funded insurance policy to itself conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirmed attack on Syrian Air Force Base not
On Thursday, an American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air force base in the Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
According to CNN, the goal had been "racets and associated equipment" of which the Israeli government feared that they had been destined for Lebanese Hezbollah.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis were held responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 rockets were seen, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesperson from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
In the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground-air rockets to Hezbollah in the past, partly successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant the crossing of a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, explains that the U.S. espionage had "unreasonably gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated that the US's defensive attitude towards its surveillance programmes had been compromised by saying that in some cases the spying had "unreasonably gone too far".
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for turning to autopilot when the explosive revelations of Whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of dismay from the sides of its allies.
At a talk transmitted by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: 'Without a question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, have heard of some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do what is still due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to the 11th of September.'
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far'.
The President is determined to clarify and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
However, Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: 'We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.'
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people, blow up the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the fears against the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who is the first member of the Senate as a democrat and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concern about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, according to which the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have put pressure on relations with some US allies, even though the Head of Secret Service this week stated that the reports were inadequate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was customary on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words".
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have used for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, on weekends, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grievances of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the Bundesliga-Auswachspiel of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is talking about a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will decide on his commitment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorers with six hits.
Because the Mainzers must already refrain from the injured service carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian files appeal against prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has filed an appeal against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after she had reported to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having invented the story.
She was held in police custody on the spot until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a low-level prison on the outskirts of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the foreign ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the judgment and is free of charge against a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was to be read that in the meantime she vacations in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
From the court's side it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that, after the recent murder of the travel saleswoman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could try to improve its beaten up tourist image, and it therefore comes to an acquittal.
