A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republicans' leaders justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth, confirming that electoral fraud in the United States is less frequent than the number of people killed by lightning.
The Republicans' lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the elections in the various states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have since 2009 announced new laws that make registration or urination more difficult.
Following the November 2010 elections, this phenomenon gained importance, with 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare invalid the right to register as an electoral candidate on the day of the election, and approve the right to vote for which there is a judicial act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has requested voters to present a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the last two years, they have promoted draft laws in 34 states that force voters to present a photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photo ID issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay to obtain the necessary ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
That's enough.
The students, who are regarded as voters, who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards for elections issued by these associations.
Before 2004, no state had requested proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws calling on voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states that have abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of newcomers registered in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the time period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they represent only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who had elected in advance.
In contrast, the whites, representing 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
The democratic critics brag about the party political nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear goal the influence of the results in the 2012 decisive states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have passed these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required by the Electoral Board to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatic cancer early detection: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows wrong results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation of the already indecisive men for carrying out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got the opinion of two doctors.
In the studies carried out in the USA, there were numerous factors of interference between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that the probability of metastases forming after 12 years is 30 to 40% higher when no early detection has been performed.
That's why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men of African-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient has to be made really aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely that the disease will be actively monitored.
Today, in many men who have been diagnosed with cancer, there is no treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be monitored actively and offered treatment when the disease progresses.
It is with increasing accuracy that we determine the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who should not.
That is why I still recommend carrying out the test.
The most important thing, however, is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers any more, this value would increase at least to 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unexplained.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is damaging to the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after leaving the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, gastrointestinal, oesophageal, abdominal and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excess, it increases the risk of developing a cancer of the gut or of the colon.
Herbal products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more than an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"The performance of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has aroused some excitement last summer, and this for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "minimum false" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be completely sure about it.
Still, let us assume that this is actually the Higgs, as there seems to be little risk of being deceived, and let us look at what it's all about.
There is an imperative law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and try not to be too strong as you will get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantity state", where this "state" is largely composed of some of its characteristics.
From this the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermione and who obey Pauli's principle in a manner that is good.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists, who are not holy - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided by the Berkeley laboratories (by the way absolutely amazing) into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
But it has to be stressed here that these bosons are not all that exotic creatures, as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bottom" of the electromagnetic force.
If a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes its direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" right at this place, in about a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of power".
Stabilising field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" so that this boson shows up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little like a frozen pond, whose surface could only be dismayed by a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep itself on the fridge.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the others (like the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research be "good", asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine all deviations between observations and SM's predictions.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who hope that such deviations will be found, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and block some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (now ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Implication
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the Bell laboratories did not assume that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was regarded as a "laboratory" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has presented it with the 2009 Nobel Prize for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... ā Le Devoir
Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its Committee on "Death in Dignity".
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this in more detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he consents to be helped in eating.
Courageously he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to heal my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeping in his face," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois' home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"That depends on the ability of the person", he notes, taking a step backwards.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, major events are taking place in the midst of these retrogressions.
The patients assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be burdened with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and through suffocation".
But through the illness I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in my life," she says before she accepts that she is put on a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit from her son, who comes from Italy in the next few days.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is offered with a group of volunteer body care and help in taking food.
Palliative care is used when there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care on 11.700 inhabitants.
That's very little, considering that one day we'll all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you give the deceased a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics do not need to control their blood sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is no day like the other.
In addition to an old man of 93 years who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while he is in his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the home Victor Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the end stage of their life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Montreal metropolitan area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
This very great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specialised in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law to regulate mortality and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone has a right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death care.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days of great pain in the emergency room, without taking measures to relieve them.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients in spite of the worst predictions blotted out until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the caregiver for not admitting this wish after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Domestic Palliative Care of the Montreal metropolitan area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, the doctors thus often resort to the terminal sedation, which runs out to sleep the patient either sporadicly or permanently until the time of his death.
We cannot continue to do so as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be eased."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism fellowship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, construction companies, financial agents of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are entangled.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has broken down since drastic measures have been taken," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of Montreal police.
The scandal was discovered by him because of a thorough investigation of the misconceptions in relation to the contracts for road construction work in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only agreed reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasises that "the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts" because some of them were tying their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen to two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011 is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau troops" who have since 2009 made Montreal's "channelling cartel" more restrained in the artificial outburst of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out house searches and has filed charges of fraud and corruption against local authorities such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city.
He is suspected of having received several lubrications in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambia, were accused.
The latter has aroused interest by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to one of the brokers associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambia had his hand everywhere in the game, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that he had organised an illegal procurement for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts, the costs of which have been artificially incurred by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of 736,000 dollars in return for sewerage contracts whose costs he artificially incurred.
Other road construction officials admitted that they were lubricated by artificially blowing up invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking away at a shadow budget that filled his checkout with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal property that was purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that she is "drawing on a thread that enables us to understand the functioning of the system under investigation by ants, to stop the evil and to challenge the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of clearing the wound, however, need an investigation unit for Montreal only, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, notes that "the officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but above all, they are concerned about the role of the "mandate carriers who are involved in the tactics of the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% black money share in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is only a weak cancellation of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to 100 dollars, which would not change the situation: "As long as the electoral campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by courageously going to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh at taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me much.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't break out with enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They therefore take advantage of the competition launched by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions to this summer are used to playing games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makellele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti brings respect to all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from an injury series.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the top rider's seat.
But we're lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the eighth finale.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words spoken against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play back the eighth-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG is providing the funds for this project to take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to reject this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have concluded with 79 points.
Normally you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are missing the title, I think we have the way to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can blame us, that is certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point lead in the game break!
That said our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependency".
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing out a bit of playing time.
I've seen things there that I've been strengthened from.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to show an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and is the winner.
Just as it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a forced decision in Spain on 16 October (1:1) a start-up game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin payments and sales without bank are possible
The opposite of current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, Bitcoin's price fell five months later to 2 dollars before recovering to about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies like the "Credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin all network nodes are at the same time keepers of the account book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction are electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public accounts invoice published throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, privileged to add this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided into one hundred million pieces, leaving a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows this deficiency.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind of money.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the invoice book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converted bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
By the way, the ECB's report provides for a reassessment of the various risks that are considered to be high today in the event of the success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbeken and Tajikistan.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with the aid of French loans, took place properly.
The truck and tank convoys flooded by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influxes in Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overtaken by war because of the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their takeover of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by confiscating government land to sell it as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive American subcontracting.
They got themselves in trouble, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country as well as those who have been able to make use of American funds: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have been in contact with the modern world and have enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There's an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will be deprived of the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the 1964 Constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the April 2014 elections.
However, since the 1950s and long before, his country has been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a 30-year war-based country, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense treasures of soil.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to be able to do so.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' and boys' gymnasiums, French Institute at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit activities and measures for the restoration of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which many local workers were required, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free farmers from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which is their own wish, it would be necessary to continue less, well controlled and directly concerned with civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution With the Breaking Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains divided more than ever in relation to the constitutional declaration that temporarily grants it unlimited authority, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has been relying for almost two years on a provisional, severally amended text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "step right with his feet".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to refrain from their efforts to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging throughout the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, the Egyptian people are being put to an ultimatum with this recourse to an accelerated vote: "either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to reach the quorum 11 people were added yesterday morning, in a hurry of 11 people, deputy members.
Some are very close to the Moslem brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles have usually been adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the body felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly was not exactly going.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, finally remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberals, who only consider this to be a propaganda attack, respond to "shining holiness".
Because according to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt's specialist Sophie Pommer, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment to recognize.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be a ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are rejected by the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question of to what extent civil judges are competent to decide could be raised."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised for the wide-ranging powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Moslem brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as called for by associations to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text they regard as a threat to freedom.
Blasphemy will continue to exist, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to free speech, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no longer refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unspoiled nature.
The AIF gives you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
bowing to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the setting of the seastorm and the fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the shrines, however, are in Jerusalem.
Here believers take the path of suffering or the path of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Praetorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the church of the tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend says that the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the Lamentations Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
Traditionally, people of different denominations leave papers with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a trip in the amount
The ruins of the Fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in the year 25 A.D.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins with their own strength.
All the others will take an airway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, between 1600 and 2040 meters high, is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which there are countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, allegedly pagan gods lived at the summit.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all can be visited by just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be paid a visit.
Among them is once the Israel Museum not far from the Parliament.
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rocky caves in the Judean desert, are preserved, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several rooms of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guides nor souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most touching section is the monument for children built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the banks of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
There are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums in each of the three locations.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea also bathes in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and thus carries even non-swimming on the surface without any problem.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sun) and sludge as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touch the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets lie in the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, was linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after constellations.
Fortuna is to be the legend of all who touch the walls in the street with their constellation.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusade Knights.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
These days evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Favourites for tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is not taken in euros, but in dollars that can simply be changed into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed train and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 Shekels regardless of the mode of transport, which is sufficient including switching for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without sheds and food containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with beef and veal, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made of pure beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no straying dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-nourished cats that stroll through the streets cozy and unhindered.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicacies.
Depending on the brand, a car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which represents an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparative period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MEPs and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families who remain in the home country.
On 1 December, a law entered into force requiring every migrant worker to pass a test attesting to the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail trade.
However, the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers over time according to the Federal Migration Authority.
It is not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is the official language.
It also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problems and protection of rights
The total number of examination posts will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 relevant centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, civil rights activists asked several times the following question: What does the whole thing actually mean?
What changes does the regulation require language skills both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, in response to speakers from the Migration Authority, the aim is to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Migrants face problems without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him under the pretext of help into a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and will scour 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many complaints from our migrants reach us.
"In your home country, the One will be promised to you, and upon arrival you will be betrayed, their passports will be removed and not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the Tajikistan Labour Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't yell, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they cannot only master the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Usbeken and Tajikistan can afford basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothing, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizen lawyers stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only legal migrants are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, then there is no test and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Entrance for unauthorised persons prohibited"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely falsified and we are not registered, and then there are cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Just don't spare any costs for wrong papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The falsified papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased is the agreement of both civil society and civil society.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers are offered jobs without language skills in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
The share of legal weapons in criminal offences is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the Arms Act for private arms owners.
This is how the authorities react to recent events: Injured at shootings at weddings and seven dead at the amok of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal supported the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be presented shortly by the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "sinless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal attorney, Wasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private arms owners of criminals will not prevent them from operating on the black market.
At present, according to the authors in Moscow, any weapon can be found for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Supplier: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen from the law enforcement agencies of criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement staff.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Explosions often occurred in many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today there are countless private armament factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore throw away arms under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many pistols and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes craftsmanship production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was produced by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
According to the investigators, the vast majority of illegal weapons originate from the army and the judicial authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there because of the "debt of those responsible for their work on weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are from thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant from a gunstore who does not want to be mentioned by name assures us that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been bought by anyone since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to obtain the supply in a stockpiles of weapons.
A gun, such as a TT-type gun, is purchased via an enemy.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything and, therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically carry out control purchases by dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested that I come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I only got the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and meet with a code like "by Ivanovich, who makes sure that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting a few punch rings right now about a friend I trust.
He only gives me the punch rings because he knows I'm not giving him a hand.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to the schemes, he did not change.
He received a photo album, in which "everything possible" was depicted.
"I felt like in the luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There are no papers needed or personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a combat gun or gun".
There, users place your orders and make inquiries.
Are minors also sold?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless shady websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network all the way to the service.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and may shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The persons responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM.
"As an answer, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesperson of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that when you place a request on a website, you can finally go out empty and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless shady websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network all the way to the service.
"People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices range from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a Macarow-type gun for between 100 and 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle rank guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia declined by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives fell by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth is somewhere behind Mc Donald's checkout.
In recent days there have been massive protests against low wages in Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go out again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, protest organisers pursue the aim of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the USA, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handshake.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and struck down with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart factories are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low-paid Walmart workers buy only at their own workplaces.
The prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand-scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the company's health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 an hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they are now donating for wages.
If Walmart were to turn the pay increases completely over to the customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be $12.39 per year for them compared to today's additional expenditure.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that only nine states have protested and they have not given any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in its store from 8:00 in the evening on Thursday to midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashier carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The spokesperson of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had done the work and the protest action had only been "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart-Fiiliale (which is not desirable in this advanced city and is therefore not yet existing), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to make so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. youths were behind the counter after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw in it the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, during interviews with McDonald's employees, I encounter people who complain that they have to pay this wage and even feed their children sometimes.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and in Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of unions in the fast-food industry.
The US law prohibits corporate governance from standing in the way of this goal and denouncing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a midday assembly in front of McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city councillor Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should help fast-food employees together to get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, not all of whom are busy in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize all the masses.
"To date, the brain can only be slightly outsmarted"
The topic of expanded reality, popular with modern technology fans, has recently been usually perceived by the lens of a special spectacle.
At first, Google presented a functioning model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November, it became known that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at Microsoft's Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly which research your group is conducting.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no more Xbox is sold without Kinect, as all are interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
To do this, however, it is necessary that not only the user but also its environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she being overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any type of interaction with computers is good, however, each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of control of objects in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and buttoned, instead of with exuberant gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a watch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this sprudeldosis?
They say it and at the same time indicate it.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and can't afford at the time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the next few days we will have to work primarily on developing new sensor types that will enable people's reactions to be more accurate.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the algorithm developers have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y axis, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and open-minded, the present 30 fps are too few especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed a device just like that, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember quite well, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of advanced reality technology in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think the most amazing variant would be a "changing" extended reality in which we could switch from a cloud of glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and their strength (privatees can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality by glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortal.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible response!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the expanded reality as the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
She's got a great sense of pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently as weak as someone breathing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
It makes me think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only moderately superior, and many years of work are ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the excellent list, already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
Rosbalt's new hero is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red bearded beards you meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at a scene meeting or at a promise.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are shown, they attract great crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile in their faces and provides them with a good mood.
Recently he snapped a rotary organ and became a Petersburg rotary organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist’s existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example, in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the gray norm, triggers aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newskiy Cultural Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", from which came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then was finished.
It draws me to the theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaya 10, and there, until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" got there.
Their friends and string sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight jerseys, and they also belonged to today's trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became a "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the art clinic.
Our employees and regulars went there.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press on the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and with that I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In modern times it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and makes me afraid to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone takes care of the clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you can't give a man your hand, but you should spit it in his face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban rotary organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if not me?
- Could commercial art be nice?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: Bohemia loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar note everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- To Stas Michailow's appearances come several thousand!
- To him come abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes wrong.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the accomplished.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that were hung by a collector even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that usually come only at the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That is the culture I am in favour of.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who could be the experts, but they will be blocked because it takes higher-ranking experts to properly evaluate the former and to clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient soil.
On our stones, art can only grow badly.
We need a cultural nourishment because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who attend exhibitions or concerts.
This is much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Earth warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in zero gravity or on the replacement planet?
I do not think that there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Institute of Sternberg, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a great height or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the orbit-bred peas did not differ at least from the earthly species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quails were sent into space to investigate the impact of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick needs to stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the chicks crossed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely subsided.
The chicks did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks slip and then set the whole thing up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will have only the same sexual species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
As a matter of principle, nothing special has been identified.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats grew up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk with Tereshkowa.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gulls flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space travel veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female Cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also Cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into the orbit," concluded Kosmonaut Waleri Polyakow, a hero of the Soviet Union and a hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet, mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and artificial gravitation.
The hydro lab in the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of suspendedness, the cosmonauts win routines for work in open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even though adults feel that water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; yet, infants feel that water is a natural element.
It is as if the little ichtyander testified to the fact that life on the land emigrated from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's belly for about 9 months in the fruit water and that it can then be more easily used to water.
In principle, it makes sense, as from birth until the first swimming just 2 weeks pass.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child the weightlessness is thus a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form back enormously quickly and thus also reduces the ability to squeeze out the child.
Well, let's deal with this through birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in orbit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we jointly undertake, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring about a disabled person, a completely inappropriate person," says the director of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is mere theory.
But at some point, it becomes a reality when earthlings break up in their spaceships into a distant planet that will be the home for their offspring born in space.
NKÚ-Chief: Control of the Black System fails due to political indebtedness
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws, but falls under their application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, this is said by the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neavyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly - and this is not the case with us in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to also result in joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he led Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, cannot interfere in its activities," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project comparing the laws of both countries on public procurement.
What was that about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel examination, which we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is a question of the European legislative framework defining how public contracts should be handled, on which the national legislation is based, and finally there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in us are perhaps even a little more "harder and perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules over and over again. One must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results from this project?
Especially such joint control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and break down thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economy means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, lowering the thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we only burden the system with excessive "paperwork", and those who are looking for gaps in the system, it is much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to ours and also has a college, which is formed only a little differently. In principle, however, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, although Germany is a state, i.e. that there are these courts of account in the individual Länder - in this the German system differs from ours.
The Federal Republic of Germany is only allowed to control what corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are under the control of the national accounting offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is this because the examiners are better there?
This is certainly not, but as I said, I do not like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are exemplary to us also have problems to contend with.
Otherwise they wouldn't have anything from working with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the Procurement Act, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novel is only in force for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our tests.
Since our checks are subsequently carried out, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt effects rather in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of uneconomicality" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here, of course, the changes will have an impact as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules can become "harder" and no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) for the fact that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to an infringement of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a formal mistake that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us say which path is not the goal.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not light up the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is forbidden by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the supervisory authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, hinders its activity.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing things to happen," but he can't say that we're doing this as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal conduct of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the offerer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what is missing from us in my opinion.
On the streets there are isolated ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice plains.
Most of the roads, however, are well-travelable, sometimes increased caution is needed.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlovy Vary the streets were well-travelable this morning, isolated snow and ice plains prevailed.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it should get a little warmer during the day.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the ridges of the Erzgebirge there are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district guard, there was a limited view because of fog.
The R6 and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully navigable.
However, attention is needed, for example, on bridges on which the roads are sometimes required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are also navigable.
However, snow remains on these roads in part required or run-out.
Increased attention is therefore needed especially in the higher layers.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger because of ice glaciers, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes on the streets still a run-off snow layer, the road and highway management communicates on their websites.
Road champions warn drivers against ice-creams, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, it is possible to reach the icy plains on roads of the second and third road classes in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory Mountains.
A run-out snow layer lies on the streets of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The streets in the Pilsen district are now well-travelable, but local attention is required, and the way of driving should be adapted to the weather.
This is chilly in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice plains on the streets.
Locally, fog is also expected, but the vision will improve in the course of the day.
This information is provided by the district street champions.
The D5 motorway is virtually fully navigable, but increased attention is recommended by the road champions between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The roads of the first road class are mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, ice plains can come in part.
The roads of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore also here the reference to possible required sections.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequent roads in the area of Bohemia.
Olomouc District
Today, snowshoes have to expect riders who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snow match remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow driving forced the road champions to use, in Šumperk County about 3 cm of fresh snow fell, according to the Road Administration.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully navigable.
"In Šumperk County, snow remains in the highlands.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers have to expect snow in the direction of Jeseník," said an employee of the Šumperk Road Administration today to the agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to go out at night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road champions report several bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice sheeting, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí district is blocked according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain below zero in deeper locations, so that snow and ice will stay on the streets. However, no problems are reported from the deep plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported mainly from the perimeter of Štětí.
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, during the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes and from road I/13 on the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches that were pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think is going to happen in less than a month of the end of the world?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people so much like to approach.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more fun about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before that, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
Who did this idea come from?
Originally probably from me, then we developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to generate enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once hand over this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Walkdown Fallout".
Even today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are transmitted live together in a direct circuit from Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, and Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
This has shown that most people are interested in and have fun working with us.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap at the Jedlička-Institut.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will build our own building, into which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to set up a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occur.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "large events" also planned for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to be present at the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we are already in the USA, would like to link this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. We also need to carry many instrument suitcases and other luggage.
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in each country with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses in Russia to the fact that everything in the East is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural to leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, associations are also formed there that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're gonna hang out on...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is very common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in the public area, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not exactly common for a larger group of disabled people to be actively involved in social events there, in which we are a bit ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I began to be a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging in something intense.
And since I'm a musician myself and I play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, in time, that's how our moderator, Láʿa Angelovič, used to say something out of control (laughs).
But didn't the band become known until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started actively promoting for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see it outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good lecturers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to bring it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that things can be handled differently.
In the show business today often copies one another.
This is logical in its way, since everything new is considered with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; that's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live a full life and develop if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole of society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can't compromise in many things, and you have to ask for a certain discipline.
This, I believe, is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have twice a week's trial, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá­a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecasted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 2 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected to each other via live circuit and a joint interpretation of the anthem "World Disaster Falls Out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide funding for the provision of a multi-functional disability-related education centre, which will be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: CZK 25 million
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemia Ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this Space Agency. Poland is therefore the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member on 12 November 2008 ESA).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's way into space, of course, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in space travel, and they did not always come across understanding.
I remember here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters was named after him on the earth-facing side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the Draisine.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered shots.
The research carried out by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzychiegi.
From the documents submitted it is clear that the research has progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the specialist press the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukovy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, his work was finished from the start of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space travel are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have a future.
As early as 1956, the Polish space company PTA tried to join the International Federation for Space Navigation, founded in 1951, and, in fact, PTA became a full member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space Navigation.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the highly successful Meteorological Rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests in the Błędów desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was halted.
Following the first RM rockets, the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and its starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket has a transport space of 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B has 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C has 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the first flight tests began in October 1970 at the Aeronautics Institute.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites under the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski was named after the Czech Vladimir Remek second intercosmonaut.
The repeal of the Non-Proliferation Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit-making works.
This decision raised a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) there are price tensions.
This term refers to a condition in which the manufacturer tries to survive in economic competition by importing cheap goods, by "substituting" competition in order to break down a larger market share in itself and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move or buy their production abroad, or to give up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver private capital to their own people without regard for the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially in the pay field.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever greater differences between poor and rich.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery agencies for poor people for a number of years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As the German economy becomes more competitive, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to raise its income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU South States will undoubtedly run to the same state, where people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse in their social level, or to pay a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that someday private capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of how this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital does not go far enough, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages at all.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital strictly insists on its view that the State must not intervene in a far-reaching way in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even direct it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual discrimination, legislation in which virtually everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a state ministry is responsible for the preparation of draft laws by private legal companies closely linked to the industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer based on the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but on strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies at present quickly entered a situation in which they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful encroachment on advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew without hindrance, and the people went to the elections with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not apply to offices, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be elected" ... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it turns out, today's society as well as antiquity is founded on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is not in a position to recognise and enforce the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not trying in the slightest to seek deeper reforms.
The cause of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's state, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, during which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are facing the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the Non-Proliferation Act is no solution here, at least no lasting solution.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms, which increase State participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"...that nothing is created by violence, or could ever be created" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...that we may not forget how fragile we are" .
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, numerous reactions.
One stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians; argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is guilty and who is the victim in these ever-recurring waves of killing; finally, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open the reader up the view behind the scenes, the view of who the 95 years of tension (as calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patches of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who set their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a particular one emerges, which could be described as the head of the Kraken (I don't know if there is anyone above them, but I don't shut it off) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of its name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the strengthening of its power, the increase of its assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are engaged in wars or armed against them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis only four remained, while Russia in the meantime submitted its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as Central Bank, began to issue his own bank notes during the Civil War and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the FED for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global gulf of power of Rothschild led to the formulation of a plan for the detachment of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would ensure their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (Ecumenism is here nothing more than the foreplay) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to aggravation of the situation (see the founding of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not recur).
After the murder of Habsburg Throne Successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden military and economic unwarranted capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire), and then the central European power of Austria-Hungary was dissolved.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the banks created a latent conflict situation through politics by reserving Germany with gigantic war repairs, thus creating the conditions of impoverished masses, so that they could only cheer up a sufficiently strong leader to the Germans, who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on the role of easing the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the condition for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain on which the international bankers had held him at first, or whether everything was going according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared for World War II by war repairs against Germany, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of a focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will, like World War II, become victims in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just remember how sharply the people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the desire of individuals and their aspirations for global power at the beginning?
You have to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership here, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are choosing only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-affected politician loyal to international banks, who does everything in his power to wage war with Iran, who, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly become a global conflict, and who, because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormuz, across the 20% of world oil supplies, could lead to a destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their vision, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes for the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all to give themselves a sign of painting to their right hand or to their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign of painting, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! He that hath understanding considereth the number of the beast.
For there is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The movie Argo: If it's the worst call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford to throw the shawl overboard, as this would have greatly damaged the trust of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to liberate hostages only made everything worse.
Finally, after 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian Government, the diplomats taken were released.
The fate of the hostages called for a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity – travelling with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly visited film locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husaren piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily sharp, are therefore coming.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career with this film.
A smiled actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor he is no longer the goal of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time it is Affleck's first film not playing in the local director's Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the entrance sequence of the destruction of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and nevertheless conveys the feeling of confusion and unforeseeableness that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck has a similar effect with his team even in fictitious scenes (the false film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that history does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, he works quite successfully with the little one, sometimes helping the reality a little - which then does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is prevented by a telephone call in America, or also the persecution hunt on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its far too wide scattering, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction. It’s a film that can be watched with some interest and the design and retro-style reminiscent of a 70th-year-old thriller.
However, he only stirs up enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history alive to this day in a certain way and as a proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and all-knowing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
This year the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually calls a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided to organise the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"The recent plan presented by the EU to us to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organisation of this survey, to the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominees are, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have had an advantage in life insurance because they are objectively less risk to insurance companies.
"Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013", Nacher informed.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory incorporation of bioethanol into fuels that are subsequently harmful to the natural environment, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, because eggs have become much more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the actual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the Czech banks' demands with the threat of veto).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "crushing anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonised the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been refuted to the resistance of some countries by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called on an American study, which according to balloons is the leading cause of suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market litter.
Curiose ideas are also available at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who has an official role in the EU must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject to Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU Regulation on the scope of food stocks in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus determined the maximum volume of food stocks that could be found on the day of our accession to the EU in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the fixed volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea or for the idea of providing funding for applications for grants.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for a refund from the EU," declared former Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain crop had been very high and the state stocks had been overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palas.
The European Commission finally accepted the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding provided to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), should be a specific instrument for setting up funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, while regulations in the Member States are becoming easily the object of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole are more worthy of recognition by some experts.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is more the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been coerced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also point out here that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the interior (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, Lübecker Marzipans and Parma hams now also includes Karlsbader Zwieback, Carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkuchen or the Hořicer roll can grow.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything were to work in our country without problems, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years as thieves walk around freely, while people are being increased in taxes and retirement ages.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am already over 40, independent and impartial, I have no other way of influencing things than running for the office of Senator or President.
In the Senate you did it and then immediately set out on your way to the castle.
Is this not how you turn your back on your voters?
I have been telling myself all along that I will take up the struggle for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I would be running for the President's office if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people are barking in the pub and in front of television, but that we are making everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob one of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, about me, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle has taken place with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective asset declarations of over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked to ensure that the guide remains a free trade and that this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from every party what is best for our country without drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
I am not concerned about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always publicly support every good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
For my part, this can be described as populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will only be left with keywords.
And that does not make you far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people for long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to enforce these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to lay down the legal and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the people who have spoken would then have to say, if necessary, why they refuse this.
A strong personality that points to maladministration can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I am quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone can't do anything; that's why I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don't want to run for the Senate either.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who, however, refused to work because of overwork.
I also supported the investment journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
My candidacy began with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have usually elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're just two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about this because I do not have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign; in my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK are.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at approximately CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million. And then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond has always liked me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought against evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't arouse too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to contest the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your way out?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But this is not related to the level of the salary.
As promised, I have partly driven back my activities.
For example, in the spring my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and so on.
As President, however, I would like to stop my business altogether.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - following the example of Spiekenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passantine on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what else we need a library for today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily to one of those old-style libraries today, right?
Spiekenisse, a hardly visited sleeping town in front of Rotterdam's gates, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully brushed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the Statistik master: a library had to come here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the awesome bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still suspicious of looking around and tilting with the shoulders, the naughty Maas piled his exquisite bring of the size to a pyramid and ended his activistically underpinned speech with the words: "Dear Township!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million Euros mountain is uplifted.
It is part of a revitalization project, including underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless town retorts, which up to now had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfathomable ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkennis now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookledorado under cheese bells.
While there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true room and reading delights unfold as the topography rises.
The all-glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already have a look out for parkbank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the bookshelf stands along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is mostly untiring and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and pushed the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is skillfully used: In the center are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves that are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes brooting, sometimes climbing rails.
Optics, haptics and smells are foreign.
Even incarcerated architects and construction engineers shake their heads about the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town council of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so one day we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture in a friesland farm.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre thin plastic surface has been used as a root material in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the bulky.
For the library, the nonwovens - first in these quantities - were pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, resilient material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reached the summit.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long hike, you will be rewarded in the Literaturcafé not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crocets and potted ficus trees.
They provide an atmosphere, but above all provide the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donate for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth's heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass storm, even on sunny days the sun is only shining within.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand across the glass façade, serve as a shading and absorb a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest do fully automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured his way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Buchenberg as the "longest overdue soul".
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces - have not yet been filled.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only for decoration.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the kingly discipline called in the professional jargon identity foundation.
Spiekenisse has written literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin stopped.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the Libyan uprising in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it was about establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is precisely changing its foreign policy, away from a policy managed, as it were, by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
Aggravatingly, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think she was still working on her role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or the UK.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests had an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly matters.
But I wouldn't want to give too much weight to that either, that's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great deal of understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and that its interests need to be taken into consideration.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there any disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that under Obama, the government has a fairly secret understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so fond of Netanyahu's policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans realize that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or does Germany still have a difficult leadership role?
Germany is not used to it yet, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, different anti-German feelings become free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the US's influence in European policy is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Markenschutz" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind it is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the real names don't complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're getting the right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing law firm, who specializes in copyright violations in Fernost.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
A few additional letters are already available to the copyists so that they can register their trademarks.
Thus, from Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny entered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, for example the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company had the trademark Zegna DF Puma protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegillo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in violation of intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he contends that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business-damaging, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the single position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the sectors concerned go to the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
For up to nine years, the procedure can proceed with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected actions because, after the long term, the contested name had become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff was in trouble, he even had to pay the plagiarist because he was violating his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese may therefore still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were shortages in 2010 due to insufficient personnel and space equipment.
Last year, however, the "emergency situation in the work process has returned to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 oppositions are still pending in the office.
Taking action, however, costs a lot.
As often happens in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth consecutive time, China is making the list of new applications worldwide, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
This means that each application costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
In contrast, it costs a lot, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitation car parts was eliminated.
However, the copyist continued to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
It was not possible to protect family names in Germany, says Hanno Wenzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office rejected the opposition of the Munichers.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the trial opponent continues to fight.
You have to be careful.
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wenzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be estimated, the company archive even had to look through files one hundred years old in order to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," Wenzler says.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to shrink back to Europe.
If Imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business line has been abandoned by the Group for a long time, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
"You have to be careful carefully," says Wenzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful about business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather the foreigners "should register everything that is somehow worth protecting even in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the other side license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that overcomes well over 8733 kilometers.
First there is the punching: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slipper looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor and soprano - distress, deceive and persecute themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost takes it out of his shoes when he brings it together with his smooth, wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tastes a new song.
The fifty singers have come from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the Hausmann.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and it is also spoken in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping Self - Help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Association Voices for Africa has found Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantu language fluent can speak no one in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and has occasionally returned them to where they originally came from: in the South of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitcheni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are responsible for the HI virus.
In Esitjeni there is little evidence of the disease in Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Cropping of the male foreskin, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with mid-thirty dying is not rare.
During a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation you have no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been working almost professionally for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhoea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, Human Papillomaviruses, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and crevices belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper are mainly found in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (pills), tripper and human papilomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is comparatively low - yet around 20 percent of HIV new infections are attributed to this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15-25 years.
In addition, human papylomavir is common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are some of the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infections can cause genital ulcers, urination, discharge, abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubrication infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid later consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and, not least, the gages that the choir sings all over Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Those who have no more come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have had an HIV test done.
This is not a matter of course, because as obviously the disease is also throughout the country, they are best kept silent.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned life-form that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would have been on every corner," says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is another - fleesh to fleesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels through the South of Africa every two, three years together and sings songs full of pain, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-confidence, many of whom still know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but also some fierce border soldiers have shed some tears.
The journey also leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their foster children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni it is more than known.
"Go to Esicheni, there's the light," the people say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the piercing singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice on the Mercury
The probe messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that were impacted on the Mercury.
But no one links the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by earth’s citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are investigating the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This picture of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: the oldest stars can be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink-coloured "newborn" in the star-circuit.
This stellar region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has captured the top telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star hurled out in the process of death.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The Nasa peak telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiade Star Cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colours become more effective.
Like a red Age, the Helix Nebula looks at this infrared photo in front of the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His resemblance to an earthly continent brought this fog to the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: How they were created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn-mond that disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Jacuzzi Gallery
Depending on the colouring, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid fog in the constellation Schütze, which is several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), because dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation of snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the progenitors of a cosmic karambolage: 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of two melting galaxies collide with each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, they may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy is called scientist UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way are located in this star lobby.
The star cove always produces new youngsters.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette fog, continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the Big Bang when hydrogen was mainly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide have become deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space just above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable construction: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude.
Its special feature: the high light-gathering power.
In fact, despite relatively low mirror diameters, this is reaching the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its four mirrors in total, the telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be filled with 42 meters - and composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures can be expected from 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, alongside them, looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, provide the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has already delivered images of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler has been looking for extra-solar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into space on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that there is also an ice cream at the southern pole of the Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the messenger probe started in 2004 - the first to crisscross the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink every day butter - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is to be called wildromantic.
The small bus rumbles over the winding road, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you could think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian population of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town protrudes with too much-advanced architecture from Soviet times, which so does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road is only inquisitive.
The legendary wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulalayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision song festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulalayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen talyschen from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulalayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still a child born
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented human being, who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he was said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov charge himself at his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the very elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of high-aged people are also living in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are very many very old men."
However, due to the lack of evidence, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially in the absence of a population register.
Every day probably melted butter
In fact, however, the people of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why are so many very old people living here in the south?
The Asian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is food.
But that the high-calorie diet of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from the scientific point of view either.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
With her 97 years she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two babies are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical arc-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in both rope and link, under her head cloth she hides long, dark blonde pots that proudly reveal her son to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven't bought food in the supermarket for a single time in my entire life.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-war period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the rudder.
After all, there is no need among the ancients of Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local circumstances an amount of money from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son, who has long been a son, is right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalling rallying in Cairo reveals the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as the basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, until now hopelessly dismembered in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God-state on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, Muhammad Mursi almost apologized, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate title from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judicative be removed?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been punctuated by the 100-member constitutional assembly, dominated by Islamist, are partly cause for concern in a nightly, 15-hour Parforcerite.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the floating wording and the legal scope associated with it for a more stringent interpretation of the Sharia.
This at least suggests a new article: in all the matters concerning Sharia, Al-Ashar University had to be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiant power throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which de facto would result in the extermination of the Judicial.
Much in the draft text is a matter of interpretation
It is also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's reign to suppress oppositionals.
After the death of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, according to the design, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is legally so vague that state institutions could use this article to control even the contents of film art and literature.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be done remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios suggests that the term "indulgence of people" is forbidden.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
The interpretation, as so much as in the draft presented to Mursi for signature, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the supremacy of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in uninhabited concord on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised the fall of the Charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-ranking president of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winners and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "on the Müllberg of History".
On short notice Twitter, he accused Mursis' followers of wanting to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet affluent," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew to the area demonstration, but cautiously not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Niles in front of the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked of Mursi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir place, where everything began, would probably have conjured up civil war-like conditions.
Mursh's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone by February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOUR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
He was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are gross violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"In fact, instead of strengthening civil society, the President put it out of action," laments Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who considers the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul - smelling fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
They are placed in the midst of a bunch of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And tell her there for a week.
So about that, you have to imagine the nose-spraying smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Cernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is scattered with salt trout, which - depending on how stinky one would like to eat his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a festival here in Cernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very impressive speciality.
"One eats it raw and then rinses it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but as a so-called "Rakfis-General" also organizes the festival.
People around us eat small fish cubes and take in large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can dissipate the smell.
I'll buy you some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk close to your nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drowned in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter he was then removed after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol-diluted senses - consumed.
Even before one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and migrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not too long ago richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly illustrious part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world press, and most people don't seem to bother.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we refer only to the "Event of July 22nd".
Norweger struggles to accept that someone in her peaceful country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, growth has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature rake fish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very generous, we don't like brawl.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of industry income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw around with money that they did not have, Norway held its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfisk," she adds with unbridled laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening, the stink fish is back on the menu.
The hotel where I live is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed in fly that is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're gonna slap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh dusk of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that locks out several important traffic routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Presidential Bond and take the lead of the nation.
It faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he took an eye on the U.S. President, Pena Nieto worked as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one would like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to him the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represent a great improvement over the broken, bumpy streets that there once existed here.
Posters with their names also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congressman for the Pena Nietos Party, PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years the party places great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The opposition's accusations, the new president's lack of substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under motorway transfers and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was deployed to combat the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women were left alone on a spot near a large garbage dump in the last two years.
During the reign of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that surpasses the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and murder of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos consider that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murders properly during his term of office.
But in the worst case scenario, his government had closed its eyes to the problem.
Irinea Buendia fights with the tears in a concrete building, typical of the downhill district, as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is placed next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But exactly this, the family said, was refused her so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a sweater, troublemaker, nörgler.
They want their judgment simply accepted and their mouths shut.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the Presidential Bond on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have suffered from violent crimes in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecutor's office claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse.
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations that he was abused in prison.
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
The release of the U.S. Army is accused of having wasted thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution tried on Friday to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed to complain in military terms about the abuse he allegedly suffered.
During a cross-examination of Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents on weekly visits had not had any complaints about his treatment made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month term of detention in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh term of detention - Manning had stated that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
During the Friday hearing, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had eaten under increased conditions of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they had to deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote up "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," says Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the idea of suicide mentioned by him on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning announced his arrest and relocation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held almost two months before being transferred to the prison of the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world had been stressful.
"My world shrunk on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
Only a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses were allowed.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
Still he had to sleep with light that reached from the outside into his cell.
If he turned around at night and could no longer see his face, they would wake him up so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's attorney raised formal opposition to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico one night and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had stated that during this count he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
During the Friday interview, Manning stated that he had closed out of an order of his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he had been forced to sleep naked during the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning had told the official that he could have used the bond of his underpants or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but this did not happen.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experience and drastically reduce his arrest, should he be sentenced to the military court at his trial, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess lower offenses for guilty, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend and the prosecution is expected to justify the terms of the detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position to maintain Manning in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners under the highest security conditions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favour of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrators - they call to their memory difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check when perplexity spread within me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ireland" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for shorts or dashes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc in line with the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war on the drug cartel, even if he did not mention details on this matter.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasted a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under the alleged gun to leave them more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official practices even the mildest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas go to the path of war.
And yet the biggest challenge facing Mexico is in fact its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people live in Mexican origins in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparents part - was not given a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this against them.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling of belonging neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to resume their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual indebtedness, countless buildings were laid in debris and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly pattern could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the armistice agreed on 21 November continues, this week’s struggles have strengthened the hard-assed on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are pampered in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is adding to the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered to be Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Thrilling Hamas supporters believe that there is an Islamic half moon around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels could stand before the downfall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the strongest and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor, which itself cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly committed to its position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violent escalations.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the detention facilities that have entered the West Bank and thus into the majority of any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal, but are being further and further extended.
Netanyahu is well on hand. His Likud party was united with an even more combative group in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why are these insidious Palestinians also hustling and leaving them to their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, would they not fire missiles just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them, should they dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab spring could put a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense seat is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi met Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolising the beginning of a new era.
Israelis too should think more in the long term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking vehement steps towards democratization, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a start from the outside
The correct answer is that which is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns areas for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than for the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house, it seems as if he was similarly opposed to participation.
But that is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive-green lids printed with drastic pictures, showing sick body parts and infants and children with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small prints, will occur on Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the world's most stringent rules for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to rid young people of smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
In doing so, the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started at 26 will not start smoking with a 99% probability after that.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply the tobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette etuis and silicone lids has increased enormously to cover the unbearable packaging since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies failed to challenge the laws two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court.
Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was waiting for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is directed.
A number of Australian laws banished tobacco companies from TV advertising, forbidding them to act as sports sponsors and forcing most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, researcher in healthcare at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has recorded an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
The question has to be asked: Is this just a private person who finds such great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even takes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is concentrating on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries are trading with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
These were now extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a tip and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
To be honest, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing up," he adds, visibly, stunned.
In a constantly electrified world, it is nice to be bored once in a while
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight at the airport half a day is quite nerve-killing - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts suggest boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one screen or another, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
I have always assumed, however many people, that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't think so.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Pompeii's walls adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience "to want to perform a satisfying activity but not to be able to do so".
So boredom differs from apathy, so that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, exists in a "disturbing of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing only slowly".
Boredom can listen to it almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're boring, even though we're having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Boredom Under the Aspect of Attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the nearby space that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to it at a low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said that they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find a reason for this, and admitted their difficulties of boredom.
If one tries to focus on a difficult or strenuous task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one is engaged in a monotonous activity - "like the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that domes and crutches, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to play around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a roaring speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scala for boredom" in the 1980s.
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external impulses.
But in general, teenagers are a rather relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found out that 32% of the adults were bored in school and doing homework, whereas 23% said they were bored if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of the parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it causes people to take on extreme physical risks and fall off gambling or drugs to alleviate them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If one is boring and one uses this energy to play and cook guitar, one becomes happy.
However, television can bring happiness in the short term, but it can escape in the long term.
So if you reach out to your bored child, you can get rid of boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to talk but also receives more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel at ease outside the constant redevelopment of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often. But boredom is the painful, constant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are, in truth, just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to get busy once the noise is muted."
There is no clear guideline for the new Marijuana Act in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a criminal offence in the southeast of Colorado, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few less marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smokes them.
Orozco said he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Orozco was preloaded for possession of drugs and drug supplies - cavalry crimes, each with a penalty of $100 - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer for hundreds of minor drug crimes depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of orders that revolve around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue to pursue existing marijuana offences and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana shops from opening up in their communities.
"This situation continues to develop so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also rattling their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, one believes that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states as far as the regulation of marijuana is concerned. There, the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the WPC in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the end point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21st, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences in people over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations for farmers of medical marijuana and continue to persecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a tougher view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to answer to court for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations involving crimes at the time of the crime," Buck stated in a statement.
The reactions are even felt in places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision but also decided not to drop all outstanding property proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep gap among local officials in terms of the great green experiment.
District attorneys are about a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the defendant in charge of marijuana offences before the courts and acts on the ground as a spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives persecuting people for criminal purposes that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acting as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for legal sales in an age, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat marijuana as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several eye-catching arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama government, believes that although criminal officials are likely not to enter doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to struggle to tolerate the legal, state-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local local authorities approved moratoriums for new marijuana business, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, decided to ban six months, which is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We focus on what the community has decided for and not on what the state has decided for.
Many questions remain.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I once held for the greatest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposia that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that fellows had sex in the adjacent room.
Author A N Wilson told me that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - a reason which seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatchers and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffer from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equal rights protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable due to their political views".
They call for a place in the equal rights committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as Eccentric and Neonazis.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and propped with silver suit and silver-filled walking stock.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "sinbooks for introducing higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday paper: "There is a growing left trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without even getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historians in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, believe that such a climate is "discomfortful". Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old, appointed president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she had observed a growing rejection of students of moderate rights among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honorary title due to cuts in higher education.
Even Stalinists would have been shocked by the atmosphere.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met and the tutors, I got a taste of the future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the strike of miners, the privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa have found their way into the wooded areas of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been drawn to what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I tripped.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and pretty hateful.
"Do those followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students peed.
Tears began to grow in my eyes.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt grumbled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting in college alone at dinner, when someone lightly tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year called James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's what it is like.
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, that's why it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to imagine.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A student in philosophy, politics and economics who, ironically, had visited Eton College as a conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt as though homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal laws of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the dawn of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched out in front of my spiritual eye to a purgatory of retribution and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty and rejected it for his Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
There seemed to be an infidelity.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said, quietly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my Communist friends always used impeccable manners.
His wet eyes were murky.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of my frequent journeys to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory's followers, had succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly shattered by shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain wash", and called her "old fool".
The relief only lasted a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hares gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd be happy to call you a cry-baby dick.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers but still hides behind an undeserved call of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distended clientele.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the nobility's snug and distant world.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most experienced aristocracy, beginning from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, the Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't leave their chickens on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went home for dinner after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited persons felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began their career at the Week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of boredom, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre walkway that proposes a roll change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audienz" wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that the Empress Farah Diba belonged to.
In this audience are fashion puppets such as the names of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Nacy Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "forgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds Feria's ex-herd.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinionist at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s it was finally added.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my Vetter's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes from the fashion maker "with absolute care" because "a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his handrails) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years now Valentino is her best copy of the "savoir-être" of the elite.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as each of his clients' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquillity, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was impeccable; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health if they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to go down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfurous gas that flows from the earth strengthens in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphuric stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets over the wasted stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb in the turtle's tempo, keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip out and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of sulphur they mine.
Upstairs, they pave the way between the tourists they photograph like circus monkeys and walk with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which has set up a mining company a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has been exploiting the occurrences of the volcano and (not better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents), because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route he needs three hours, after which he is fully accomplished, but at the end of the day he has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, however, is the triple of what he would earn with field labor.
"The daily wage of miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid on the day at the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left him the first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waitress or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also pours out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines bluishly in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers are loading the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the mining of sulphur to save costs, and delivers no equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entry fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carriage.
"This work is for animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a native, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for educating his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itches when the wind turns suddenly and the miners stick them into the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks via a goat trail between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulphur carrier with his 30 years.
Time passes, but poverty lasts generation after generation in one of the toughest occupations in the world: those who work as human donkeys on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blamed them for having no children, for their career, stress and cost of property and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: do we fulfil our civic obligations and create lives!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nevertheless - or precisely so - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local sayings such as "Shiping will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, is hoping that the advertising spot will reach in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we reproduce, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirting).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently equal to 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to have much more life goals and priorities than marrying and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in the number of single persons and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the decline in the population led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely clogged Xenophobia is flourishing against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government has achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the falling birth rate has a known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach that not so many small apartments are being built.
It has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the single person and that they are deterring the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of Property Company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by day and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads to that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were set in place before when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, discussions with the Singaporeans working in the financial district should be noted that they will not have a significant impact.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women pursue their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons why they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can do so much more.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the area of private life in which protection is entitled to be protected from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the net.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "some very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10 year old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also sell my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked photos, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in F.B. and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'll just upload it," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked he answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone told him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The 14-year-old José's case is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his list of friends.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something bad, for example music," he says.
After the boy was given, no one made any comments or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone bothers me or asks her for me, I'll just get him out of my user account" he admits.
José joined Ask after he had read a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experience is not unknown, which is known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
After that, he explains a number of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unsympathetic or I wanted to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for the search for information; but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the "Digital Natives and Immigrants" work, formed these terms for explaining the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, where we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we demand them to have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective when it is most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what is privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it be nice for you to publish a photo of you, like the one you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others are publishing about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: does everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them an understanding that they have to act online, as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Everyone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, elementary school teacher and educator, comments that it is essential that parents carefully review the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers".
End of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and to be theoretically signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources at the State and Presidential Office initially announced that they would hand it over after the session, but then explained that it would be published on the Peruvian government website for a while.
On questions about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the president's meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesperson.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort to the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Presidential Office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this was the Humala Declaration and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, the so-called so-called declaration of Lima, previously announced, was not published in spite of the press's strong call.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed the existence of information systems for journalists, but to a large extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of The Hague, which settles a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima launched against Santiago, to listen to the pleaders of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgement on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñera and greets Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia had brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious error, which agreed to submit to the judgments of that international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 since the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state leaves the final document stating that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set at a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not take triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border regions... and thus unifying our countries and opening up new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects are also five Peruvians, who were located on the Querachs of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of whom were to ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he expected on Saturday in Mexico a meeting with his counterpart Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully following a judgment of the IGH called into question by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this matter as civilised and respectfully as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective, whereby "South America can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II and other conflicts" and "to this day are practically a country of their own."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that drives the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that aim for a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the mandate to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those which have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as an allusion to the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles but had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there had been "reasoned assumptions that Assange would deliver to a third country and not comply with his procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish court that had asked him to question him on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish case law allowed this by means of a videoconferencing which could have been carried out via the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he will take physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a confined space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum that Assange had been granted since June at the Ecuador Embassy in London was the granting of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of proceedings at various European authorities," he said.
And "If Britain grants this release tomorrow, this is done in my opinion."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or on Skype, how it allows Swedish case law and was made in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that detract from the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extortion profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador on not being dominated by such journalists "and not by the banks or hegemony and scoundrel-bourgeois countries," presuming that it will "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction" when re-election took place.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain firm and must not allow opportunism and no one as a legally disguised coup d'état" because it "extended the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers that the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, is "absolutely justified."
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he indicated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured him that if he left the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under as unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It's decided," he explained.
Correa also dealt with the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for a planned routine treatment and was expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a fall in the health status of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death for AIDS today is too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the investigation: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor was trying to "weaken" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was then synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already done damage and exhausted its immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in good time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG's HIV unit, who said that this information was based on a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that although AIDS was not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances that are non-drug-dependent: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a count of 500 CD4.
To put it simply, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "become 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this expert.
In order to properly align this progress, it must be remembered that today the life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report), it is nevertheless true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients registered in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least over the past 12 years, we have had no drug supply problems. The problem is that people get into a very advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnosis is required, which is why all persons in whom this is necessary must be offered massive recognition tests."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, do sports and take the medications.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot of business, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the global AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the barn
There are large gaps between health programmes and the simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a common question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, people working in pharmacies and in the health care system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorientating this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the barn table, but in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid for the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question as to whether it would be distributed on a provisional basis under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located in the fourth place of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood, and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, because there are 4 or 5 people registered who do not know it.
After the United States Court of Appeal confirmed a judgment that did not recognise the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which had been reached through a bankruptcy in Mexico, an unwholesome precedent was created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow the Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of the Stars and Stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment given on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court in the northern district of Texas leads to the Mexican companies being exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door and gate to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, based in New Orleans, first says that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the insolvency proceedings of undertakings with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the harmonisation of international trade law, whereby the American Law Institute was used as a chatter.
Second, the judgment states that, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy capital held by Vitro's subsidiaries with its parent company, without the voting rights of the companies, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Bank for Commercial Bankruptcy).
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, Vitro’s creditors, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier-Fonds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not reach a majority.
The vote would have been 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country battles.
For this reason, the González Sada family opposes the same appeal court in order for the vote to take place in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three voted on it.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare appeal, which calls for the review of the proceedings by a higher court, is filed by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this is that the court left aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Bankruptcy, and points out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It should also be noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border incapacity to pay, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
The Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the Association of Pilots) has finally made progress after several months of the ads by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration.
The appeal brought by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
Thereafter, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic’s main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from Bank IXE’s Trust Account on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradadora Professional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society have decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from beyond the wall, complemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the run-up to this, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has succeeded in uniting the governors in the South East to resist the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without affecting the short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings over 500 million pesos certificates to the market.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Formed from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world-bummler of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for six years, whether as a player of lower classes, as a player of the first national league, as an agent and as head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the basketball association.
"I spent my life putting on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time as I was President of the BSN, Chief Executive of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed most, because since 1967 I was allowed to be part of eight vaqueros championships as managing director, co-manager or trainer.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying, "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelance specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The Vaqueros Championship with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won against the USA at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, in which we took the fourth place, which actually should have been bronze, if not that Canadian referee, who allowed us to repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Championship the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as are those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the team of the USA a fight, as they did when they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with whom we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre- Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter as a substitute for the locked players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the Gold Medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best trainer in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the Federation?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else you got to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary travel and games.
At least I see the result of the required trainings and courses for trainers, table-officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, creepy and manipulous businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Thanksgiving Festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the full," said Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" at the NBC television station.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets an attractive "Jshinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at home with him.
He was also a performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His cinematographic work included critically rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting abominable J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain over the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot at J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in bets.
The series thus reached a record of spectators in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned the "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had evicted her and threatened to represent her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city. But others also had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: an insidious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) arrested.
"I know what should be on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-author of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of lovers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the sender.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann was treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stage in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
He met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could harm someone or harm him in any way," said the Associated Press back then.
After the liver transplant, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anguished patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and after," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to be good for you".
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long backward counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, some of whom have called "deudar maggedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place of which Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyses what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer this semester, which should be the last in history, courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Beautiful.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
"We don't take up in 2012 so that we always keep the option of being able to hold the course again, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "preliminary downturn", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other chance to "go on working until night, where the world is said to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with a high average who filled up with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if there were still free places.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectal or religious mentality is actually just a matter of consolation or its lack.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing explains that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard anything from a class where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students in question - and less than one professor - declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in certain ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeilen, a student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that dates back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately think about a new date" or that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
